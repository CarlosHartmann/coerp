with those things that concern the necessity <lb/>

O my God, my ineffable <normalised orig="sweetnesse" auto="true">sweetness</normalised>, turn <lb/>
into <normalised orig="bitternesse" auto="true">bitterness</normalised> all carnal consolations which <lb/>
withdraw me from the love of celestial <lb/>
things; suffer me not, my God, to be overcome <lb/>

suffer me not to be deceived by the world, <lb/>
and its transitory glory, nor that the Devil, <lb/>
through his <normalised orig="subtilty" auto="true">subtlety</normalised>, seduce me to perdition. <lb/>
Give me strength to resist, patience to endure, <lb/>
and constancy to persevere; even meat <lb/>
and drink, and all other necessaries of this <lb/>
life are painful, and troublesome to a devout <lb/>
spirit. Therefore grant me, O Lord, at least <lb/>

them. Thy holy Law forbids us to seek superfluities, <lb/>
