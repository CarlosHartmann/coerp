                  <lb/>
O Maker of Heaven and Earth, King of <lb/>
Kings, and Lord of Lords, who <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> made <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
me of nothing unto thy Image, and <normalised orig="similitude" auto="true">simulated</normalised>, <lb/>
and <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> redeemed me with thy own precious  <lb/>
blood, whom I a sinner am not worthy to <lb/>
name, nor call upon, nor yet to think of in <lb/>
heart, I meekly beseech thee, and humbly <lb/>
pray thee, that thou <normalised orig="wouldst" auto="true">would</normalised> respect with clemency <lb/>
me thy wicked servant: and have mercy <lb/>
upon me, which <normalised orig="tookest" auto="true">took</normalised> pity upon the <lb/>
woman of Canaan, and Mary Magdalen; who <lb/>
<normalised orig="sparedst" auto="true">spared</normalised> the Publican, and the thief hanging <lb/>
on the Cross. To thee I <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised>, O most loving <lb/>
Father, my sins, which, O Lord, if I will <lb/>
I cannot hide from thee. Spare me, O Christ, <lb/>
whom I have lately much offended in thinking, <lb/>
speaking, and doing, and in all means, in <lb/>
which I a frail man and a sinner might offend; <lb/>
through my default, through my default, <lb/>
through my most grievous default. Therefore, <lb/>
O Lord, I beseech thy clemency, which <normalised orig="camest" auto="true">came</normalised> <lb/>
down from heaven for my salvation; which <lb/>
<normalised orig="liftedst" auto="false">lifted</normalised> up David from the fall of sin, spare me <lb/>
O Lord, spare me, O Christ, which <normalised orig="sparedst" auto="true">spared</normalised> <lb/>
Peter denying thee. Thou art my Creator, <lb/>
and my Redeemer, my Lord, and my Saviour, <lb/>
my King and my God. Thou art my hope and <lb/>
my trust, my stay and my help, my consolation <lb/>
and my fortitude, my defence and my deliverance, <lb/>
my life, my salvation, and my resurrection, <lb/>
my light and my desire, my aid and <lb/>
my patronage: I beseech and pray thee help <lb/>
me, and I shall be safe: govern me, and defend <lb/>
me, comfort and consolate me, confirm and <lb/>
glad me, enlighten me, and visit me, raise me <lb/>
being dead, because I am thy Creature and <lb/>
work. O Lord, despise me not, for that I am <lb/>

                  <fw type="pageNum" n="222">V3</fw>

                  <lb/>
thy servant and vassal, and although evil, although <lb/>
unworthy and a sinner, yet such as <lb/>
I am, whether good or evil, <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> I am <lb/>
thine. Unto whom shall I <normalised orig="flye" auto="true">fly</normalised>, except I go to <lb/>
thee? If thou cast me off, who will receive <lb/>
me? If thou despise me, who will behold me? <lb/>
Reacknowledge me therefore though unworthy <lb/>
returning unto thee, though I be vile and <lb/>
unclean. For if I am vile and unclean, thou <lb/>
<normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> cleanse me; if I be blind, thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> enlight <lb/>
me; if I be feeble, thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> heal <lb/>
me; if I be dead and buried, thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> revive <lb/>
me, because thy mercy is greater then my <lb/>
iniquity: greater is thy piety, then my impiety; <lb/>
more thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> pardon, then I commit; and <lb/>
more thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> forgive, then I a sinner offend. <lb/>
Therefore, O Lord, despise me not, nor <lb/>
yet take heed unto the multitude of my iniquities; <lb/>
but according to the multitude of thy <lb/>
<normalised orig="comiserations" auto="false">commiserations</normalised> have mercy on me, and be pitiful <lb/>
to me a most great sinner. Say to my soul <lb/>
I am thy salvation: Who <normalised orig="saidst" auto="true">said</normalised>, I will not <lb/>
the death of a sinner, but rather that he be <lb/>
converted and live, turn me, O Lord, unto <lb/>
thee, and do not extend thine ire against me. <lb/>
I beseech thee, O most clement father, for thy <lb/>
mercy I bow down and earnestly pray thee, <lb/>
that thou direct me unto a good end, and unto <lb/>
true penance, pure confession, and worthy <lb/>
satisfaction of all my sins. Amen. <lb/>

REceive my confession, O most benign and <lb/>
most clement Lord Jesus Christ, the only <lb/>
hope of the salvation of my soul, and give unto <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
me (I beseech thee) contrition of heart, and <lb/>
tears to mine eyes, that I may bewail <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> and <lb/>
nights all my negligences with humility and <lb/>
purity of heart. Let my prayer, O Lord, approach <lb/>
<normalised orig="neer" auto="true">near</normalised> in thy sight. If thou shalt be angry <lb/>
against me, what helper may I seek? who <lb/>
will have mercy upon mine iniquities? remember <lb/>
me, O Lord, who didst call the woman of <lb/>
Canaan and the Publican to repentance, and <lb/>
didst receive Peter weeping. O Lord my <lb/>
God, accept my prayers; O good Jesus, Saviour <lb/>
of the world, which <normalised orig="gavest" auto="true">gave</normalised> thy self to <lb/>
the death of the Cross, that thou <normalised orig="mightest" auto="true">might</normalised> save <lb/>
sinners, regard me a wretched sinner, calling <lb/>
upon thy name; and take not heed so to my <lb/>
wickedness, that thou forget thy goodness. <lb/>
And if I have committed ought whereby thou<lb/>
<normalised orig="maiest" auto="true">may</normalised> condemn me, yet thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> not lost <lb/>
that whereby thou art wont to save. Spare me <lb/>
therefore, O Lord, which art my Saviour, and <lb/>
take mercy on my sinful soul. Lose the bands <lb/>
thereof, heal the wounds, O Lord Jesus, I desire <lb/>
thee, I seek thee, I will thee, <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> me thy <lb/>
face, and I shall be safe. Send forth therefore, <lb/>
O most loving Lord, through the merits of the <lb/>
most pure and immaculate ever Virgin Mary <lb/>
thy Mother, and thy Saints, thy light, and thy <lb/>
truth into my soul, which may <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> unto me <lb/>
truly all my defects, which it <normalised orig="behoveth" auto="true">behooves</normalised> me to <lb/>
<normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised>, and which may help and teach me to <lb/>
