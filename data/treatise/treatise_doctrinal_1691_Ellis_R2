                  <lb/>
FRom what we have now proved, it may <lb/>
be too <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised>, I fear, for many of us to <lb/>
reflect very sadly upon our selves. It is certainly, <lb/>
if these things be so as <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been said, <lb/>
high time for us all to think, what we have <lb/>
been doing all the while we have already lived <lb/>
in the world, that we may know what <lb/>
we have yet to do, before we go out of it. <lb/>
<normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> high time for us to remember, That <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Cor 5.10">we <lb/>
must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, <lb/>
that every one may receive the things done, <lb/>
in his body, according to that he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> done, whether <lb/>
it be good or <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised></quote>, 2 Cor. V. 10. We must <lb/>
appear, that's certain, there is no flinching <lb/>
or evasion; all of us, without exception; and <lb/>
there will God <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 2.6">render to every man according to <lb/>
his deeds</quote>, <normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>. II. 6. When we call this to <lb/>
mind, do we not think our selves <normalised orig="concern'd" auto="true">concerned</normalised> <lb/>
to <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr/>
                  </choice> enquire, How we are prepared to answer <lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/> 
                  <lb/>
for our selves, at that most dreadful Tribunal? <lb/>
We see, that according to our deeds or behaviour <lb/>
in the body, or whilst we here live, so <lb/>
we must then be <normalised orig="doom'd" auto="true">doomed</normalised> to receive, either <lb/>
Eternal Reward, or Eternal Punishment; as <lb/>
is elsewhere plain enough. Are we able to <lb/>
plead for our selves, That we have lived a life <lb/>
of Repentance, Faith, and new Obedience? Then <lb/>
all will be well; through the rich Mercy of <lb/>
God, and Merits or <normalised orig="ouf" auto="false">of</normalised> Blessed JESUS, <lb/>
Eternal Life is assured unto us. But if we <lb/>
cannot plead this, what will become of us? <lb/>
Know we how soon we must <normalised orig="dye" auto="true">die</normalised>, or how we <lb/>
must <normalised orig="dye" auto="true">die</normalised>? As we <normalised orig="dye" auto="true">die</normalised>, so must we rise to the <lb/>
Judgment. If we <normalised orig="dye" auto="true">die</normalised> before we have lived a <lb/>
life of holiness, our deeds have been wicked, <lb/>
and according to them, we shall receive <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 2.8-9">indignation <lb/>
and wrath, tribulation and anguish</quote>; this <lb/>
is the reward of all that do evil. Will it <lb/>
excuse us to say, Lord, we have lived wickedly <lb/>
<normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> true, but we were sorry for it when <lb/>
we saw our selves like to <normalised orig="dye" auto="true">die</normalised>, and resolved to <lb/>
live a better life, if thou <normalised orig="wouldst" auto="true">would</normalised> have spared <lb/>
us a while longer? Or will it suffice us to <lb/>
say, Lord, we were always resolved to repent <lb/>
and to live well, but thou <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> cut us off by <lb/>
death, before we had begun to do as we had <lb/>
resolved, if thou <normalised orig="wouldst" auto="true">would</normalised> have let us live <lb/>
long enough? Alas, enough <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been already <lb/>
said, to convince us of the folly of pleading <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/> 
                  <lb/>
thus; and it concerns us to grow wiser very <lb/>
quickly, for we know not how little time we <lb/>
have to learn Wisdom in. We can many of <lb/>
us say already, That our Glass is almost run <lb/>
out; and he whose Glass is but newly <normalised orig="turn'd" auto="true">turned</normalised> <lb/>
up, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not know how few Sands are yet to <lb/>
run, <normalised orig="e're" auto="true">ever</normalised> it stop for ever. We that grow old, <lb/>
know, That if we have not repented, it's <lb/>
more than full time for us to begin; for begin <lb/>
now as soon as we will, we are sure it is very <lb/>
late; and a late Repentance is a very uncertain <lb/>
thing to trust to. If we have not by so long <lb/>
a delay, lost our Salvation, it may be <normalised orig="fear'd" auto="true">feared</normalised> <lb/>
we have quite lost the Comfort of being sure <lb/>
of it as long as we live. They who are young, <lb/>
cannot but know, That every day they live, <lb/>
they grow older; what any day adds to the <lb/>
time past, so much it takes from the time to <lb/>
come; and the more they have lived, the less <lb/>
they have to live; and they are always ignorant, <lb/>
whether they have a day more to live or <lb/>
no. If then the young person have not yet <lb/>
repented, <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> high time for him too, now to <lb/>
begin. If he stay any longer, his Repentance <lb/>
will be late too, and so much the less comfortable; <lb/>
and possibly it may be too late; for it <lb/>
is ten to one he shall <normalised orig="dye" auto="true">die</normalised> before he be old; and <lb/>
if not, why should he grudge himself the<lb/>
best of Comforts in Old Age, a Conscience that <lb/>
can <normalised orig="testifie" auto="true">testify</normalised> that he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> repented, and kept <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">180</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/> 
                  <lb/>
God's Commandments from his youth up till <lb/>
then? I doubt not, but whether we be old <lb/>
or young, we are so well satisfied, at least many <lb/>
of us, that Repentance is necessary to Salvation, <lb/>
that we would not willingly <normalised orig="dye" auto="true">die</normalised> without <lb/>
it. And we could not be so <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> within <lb/>
our selves, as we are, did we not either think <lb/>
our selves already penitent, or presume we <lb/>
shall be so sometime <normalised orig="e're" auto="true">ever</normalised> we go hence. I shall <lb/>
therefore now close this Discourse with a <normalised orig="necessay" auto="true">necessary</normalised> <lb/>
Caution, lest we mistake that for Repentance, <lb/>
which is not; and an earnest Exhortation <lb/>
to make more haste to repent. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
1. Let us take heed that we be not mistaken <lb/>
in this great and necessary duty. A mistake <lb/>
in a matter of so great importance, is very <lb/>
dangerous, and, I fear, as common, as dangerous. <lb/>
Corrupt Nature is so averse from it, <lb/>
that it easily persuades us to take something <lb/>
that looks a little like it, for it, because we <lb/>
find it more <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised>, and not wholly inconsistent <lb/>
with our sin. And hence it comes to pass, <lb/>
that we never repent to purpose, because we <lb/>
persuade our selves we have done so, when <lb/>
we have not. We are sensible that we are <lb/>
guilty of many sins; and who is not so, that <lb/>
believes what he reads in Scripture? Can a <lb/>
Drunkard, or a Swearer, or a Fornicator, or <lb/>
Adulterer, or any <normalised orig="Prophane" auto="true">Profane</normalised> and <normalised orig="Debauch'd" auto="true">Debauched</normalised> person <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">181</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/> 
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="chuse" auto="true">choose</normalised> but be sensible that he breaks the <lb/>
Laws of God, which there he reads? We are <lb/>
sometimes a little troubled in our minds for <lb/>
such sins, and are sorry that we have been <lb/>
guilty of them, and this moves us to fall down <lb/>
on our knees, and confess them to God, and to <lb/>
beg his Pardon for them, and to promise we <lb/>
will no more commit them. And it may be, <lb/>
we are then in good earnest, and seriously purpose <lb/>
to perform our Promises, and we receive <lb/>
the Sacrament upon it, and so seal up our Repentance; <lb/>
and so our hearts are at rest, and <lb/>
we conclude our Peace is made; and by this <lb/>
hasty Conclusion, we leave the most considerable <lb/>
part of the work undone; and we grow <lb/>
too soon confident, ever to be sure; and presume <lb/>
so quickly, That our condition is good, <lb/>
that we never use Diligence enough to make <lb/>
it good. He that thinks his Repentance quite <lb/>
<normalised orig="finish'd" auto="true">finished</normalised>, so long as he lives, is <normalised orig="deveiv'd" auto="false">deceived</normalised>: It is <lb/>
the work of our life, and is not <normalised orig="finish'd" auto="true">finished</normalised> but <lb/>
with it: Whenever it was begun, it must <lb/>
continue till we <normalised orig="dye" auto="true">die</normalised>: And it implies all this <lb/>
that here follows, which seems to be too little <lb/>
thought on by many, who think themselves <lb/>
true Penitents. <lb/>
First, There must be a very serious resolution <lb/>
to live a Godly Life after the Commandments <lb/>
of God: And such a resolution <normalised orig="supposeth" auto="true">supposes</normalised> a due <lb/>
Consideration of such things as are the proper <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">182</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/> 
                  <lb/>
motives to it. A man must consider the Nature <lb/>
of God, and his own nature as he is man, <lb/>
made in the Image of God; whence it became <lb/>
his natural duty to continue Holy as God is <lb/>
Holy. He must consider God's Absolute Authority <lb/>
over him as his Creator, Owner, <normalised orig="Governour" auto="true">Governor</normalised> <lb/>
and Preserver; and the natural obligations <lb/>
that are upon him as God's Creature, <lb/>
to Serve and Honour him according to his <lb/>
will. He must consider that the design of his <lb/>
Creation was, that God might <normalised orig="Glorifie" auto="true">Glorify</normalised> his <lb/>
own Goodness in making him a Creature capable <lb/>
of understanding so much of God as <lb/>
might enable him to <normalised orig="Glorifie" auto="true">Glorify</normalised> God on Earth, <lb/>
and be perfectly Blessed in the enjoyment of <lb/>
God for ever. All this must make him sensible <lb/>
both how vile and degenerate, how unworthy and <lb/>
wretched, how filthy, and how miserable, Sinning <lb/>
against God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> made him: And how <lb/>
being fallen from his Holiness and Obedience, <lb/>
so long as he continues in this Sinful state, he <lb/>
can have no hope ever to be Happy, but must <lb/>
lie under the Wrath of God: and unless he be <lb/>
renewed unto Holiness, the Curse which God <lb/>
laid on Sinners, which is that of Eternal Torments, <lb/>
must needs fall upon him. He must <lb/>
consider the admirable Love of God in sending <lb/>
him in this his Sinful and Miserable State, a <lb/>
Saviour to redeem him from destruction by <lb/>
the Sacrifice of his own most Precious Blood; <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">183</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/> 
                  <lb/>
and to invite him by his Gospel to Repentance <lb/>
and Faith, and to promise him the assistance <lb/>
of his Holy Spirit of Grace to restore him to <lb/>
Holiness, and to fit him for the benefits of <lb/>
Redemption, the Pardon of his Sins, and <lb/>
Eternal Happiness with God in his Kingdom <lb/>
of Glory. Such considerations as these must <lb/>
beget in us a deep and humble sense of our vileness <lb/>
and wretchedness; a godly sorrow for behaving <lb/>
our selves so unworthily towards God, <lb/>
sinking much below the dignity which he <lb/>
gave us; a holy Shame and indignation against <lb/>
our selves for this; a judging and condemning <lb/>
our selves as worthy to perish, and to <lb/>
be punished everlastingly; and a most earnest <lb/>
desire of God's Mercy and Favour; a <lb/>
firm belief of all that he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> already done for <lb/>
us in Christ; fervent Prayer for the renewing <lb/>
and sanctifying Grace of the Holy Ghost, to <lb/>
<normalised orig="qualifie" auto="true">qualify</normalised> us for a full Pardon and eternal Salvation: <lb/>
And lastly, an unfeigned resolution to <lb/>
                  <choice ana="typeset-error">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr>endeavour</corr>
                  </choice> henceforward to <normalised orig="mortifie" auto="true">mortify</normalised> all our <lb/>
lusts, to resist all temptations to Sin, to use <lb/>
all the means of Holiness, to Serve God according <lb/>
to the rules of the Gospel; and so doing, <lb/>
to cast our selves upon the Mercy of God <lb/>
through the merits of our Blessed Saviour. <lb/>
Now all this is but our first entrance into a <lb/>
state of Repentance, which is also the only <lb/>
                  <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>Sate</sic>
                     <corr>State</corr>
                  </choice> of Salvation on Earth. This is that <lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/> 
                  <lb/>
which <normalised orig="qualifieth" auto="false">qualified</normalised> persons of ripe age for Baptism; <lb/>
and this is that which <normalised orig="Baptized" auto="true">Baptised</normalised> Infants <lb/>
are obliged to by Baptism as soon as they come <lb/>
to years of understanding. And this, tho <lb/>
but the beginning of a Penitent Life, is enough <lb/>
for those who live no longer: And <normalised orig="implieth" auto="true">implied</normalised> <lb/>
in it a great deal, too little thought on by <lb/>
many. As first, A change of mind and judgment; <lb/>
our understanding being so far <normalised orig="enlightned" auto="true">enlightened</normalised>, <lb/>
that we judge otherwise of God and our <lb/>
selves, of Heaven and Earth, of Good and <lb/>
Evil, than we did before. We prise and value <lb/>
God, and Heaven, and Holiness above all <lb/>
things whatsoever, even life it self: And we <lb/>
cannot think well of our selves, nor value <lb/>
any thing in the World without these. Secondly, <lb/>
Such a change of desire and will, that all <lb/>
our desire is to please and honour God, and <lb/>
by that means to be restored to, and continue <lb/>
in his favour; and not to please our selves in <lb/>
any thing wherewith we know God is displeased. <lb/>
Our wills are resolved to consult no <lb/>
longer with Flesh and Blood, nor to be guided <lb/>
by our own corrupt inclinations and <lb/>
judgment, but wholly by the will of God, <lb/>
the Gospel of JESUS Christ, and the Grace <lb/>
of the Holy Spirit. Thirdly, Such a change of <lb/>
life and endeavour, that just now we set our <lb/>
selves in good earnest on the great work, daily <lb/>
mortifying and crucifying the Flesh with its <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">N</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/> 
                  <lb/>
corrupt affections and lusts, and cleansing our <lb/>
selves from all filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, <lb/>
perfecting Holiness in the Fear of the Lord. <lb/>
This is the first beginning of Repentance; and <lb/>
if we have not done this, whatever we flatteringly <lb/>
think of our selves, we have it all <lb/>
yet to begin. And yet is this, I fear, a great <lb/>
deal more, than many who have a long time <lb/>
<normalised orig="pleas'd" auto="true">pleased</normalised> themselves with a conceit that they <lb/>
are Sincere Penitents, have at any time yet <lb/>
well thought on. <lb/>
Secondly, After this unfeigned resolution to <lb/>
live a Godly life, there must be a constant care <lb/>
upon our Souls to make good this resolution, and <lb/>
to carry on this change, thus happily begun, <lb/>
unto perfection. We must enter upon an habitual <lb/>
course of governing our Thoughts, <lb/>
Words and Actions, by the Word of God; <lb/>
of denying our selves in all the vile desires, <lb/>
sinful inclinations and lustings of corrupt Nature; <lb/>
and of using all fit means of subduing <lb/>
the Flesh unto the Spirit, and of growing in <lb/>
Grace and in the <normalised orig="knowledg" auto="true">knowledge</normalised> of our Lord <lb/>
JESUS Christ. And here again is much <lb/>
more than is, I fear, by all of us well <lb/>
thought on. As First, A constant fixing our <lb/>
thoughts upon God as much as we can, as <lb/>
always present with us, seeing and observing <lb/>
our whole behaviour; an Eye in all things to <lb/>
his Will and Commandments; being careful <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">186</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/> 
                  <lb/>
to leave nothing undone that he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> enjoined <lb/>
us, to do nothing that he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> forbidden; to <lb/>
observe the prescribed method and manner of <lb/>
doing every duty, as being always under his <lb/>
eye. Secondly, A very diligent and frequent <lb/>
searching into, and reviewing of all these <lb/>
things; observing narrowly what has been <lb/>
defective or amiss any way, that we may be <lb/>
duly humbled, and all may be for the future <lb/>
amended. Thirdly, A constant <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>watchin*</sic>
                     <corr>watching</corr>
                  </choice> and <lb/>
standing upon our guard against all Temptations, <lb/>
whereby we may be drawn to commit evil, <lb/>
or neglect the good which is our duty, or to <lb/>
be slight and careless in the doing of it. Lastly, <lb/>
A daily using of the helps of reading, hearing, <lb/>
meditating, praying, conversing with pious <lb/>
company, or whatever may be a means of preserving <lb/>
our hearts in a Penitent and holy temper, <lb/>
and of <normalised orig="encreasing" auto="true">increasing</normalised> our love to God and <lb/>
Holiness, and our hatred of Sin He that is <lb/>
not careful to do this, as well as he can, is far <lb/>
from true Repentance. <lb/>
Lastly, After all our utmost care, because <lb/>
of the weakness of our Nature, through incogitancy, <lb/>
and <normalised orig="surprize" auto="true">surprise</normalised>, and a multitude of <lb/>
unavoidable business of this life, we shall <lb/>
find, that in many things we offend all. And <lb/>
therefore we must often examine our selves, <lb/>
and discovering our failings as well as we can, <lb/>
we are still as we discover them, to repent of <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">N 2</fw>
                  <pb n="10"/> 
                  <lb/>
them; and concluding with our selves, that <lb/>
many of them may have <normalised orig="slipt" auto="true">slipped</normalised> away, and escaped <lb/>
our observation; we are, together with <lb/>
those we have found out, to pray for the pardon <lb/>
of our secret Faults. And here first, <lb/>
The sense of our numerous Infirmities must <lb/>
make us continually more and more humble <lb/>
and vile in our own eyes, and take down all <lb/>
that confidence we are too apt to have of our <lb/>
selves, more and more convince us of the necessity <lb/>
of grace, and send us to God to implore, <lb/>
in the most humble and fervent manner, his <lb/>
strength in our weakness. And secondly, We <lb/>
ought to give glory to God in humbling our <lb/>
selves before the World; and confessing by our <lb/>
whole behaviour, that we esteem of our selves <lb/>

12. Those who have worn the Devil's Livery <lb/>
so long, Christ will not own at last for <lb/>
Persons of his Retinue. <lb/>
O why will we deal worse with God, and <lb/>
our own Souls, than we are wont to do with <lb/>
any thing else of the meanest concern to us? <lb/>
When we are in any trouble of body or estate, <lb/>
we are in great haste to be relieved; neither <lb/>
                  <pb n="13"/> 
                  <lb/>
delay we to accept of help when <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> first tendered <lb/>
to us. When one offers us a good <lb/>
gift, or other considerable kindness, we are <lb/>
not wont to bid him stay till to morrow. <lb/>
What an untoward humour is this in us? <lb/>
God made haste to restore fallen Man, and <lb/>
to comfort him with the promise of a Saviour; <lb/>
Our Saviour made haste when the time was <lb/>
come to shed his precious Blood for our Redemption; <lb/>
The Holy Ghost <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not <normalised orig="delay'd" auto="true">delayed</normalised> <lb/>
by the Word and Ministry to beseech us to be <lb/>
reconciled with God. But we delay still, as <lb/>
though, whatever else be, yet nothing that is <lb/>
meant to bring us towards Heaven and Happiness <lb/>
were worth regarding. <lb/>
Whilst we delay our Repentance, we give <lb/>
the Devil, our Adversary, all the Advantages <lb/>
he can desire to have of us. The holy Angels <lb/>
of God would rejoice to see one of us repent, <lb/>
Luke XV. 7, 10. And had we rather <lb/>
gratify the Devil by our Damnation, than <lb/>
have the holy Angels rejoice at our Salvation? <lb/>
Whilst we delay, the Devil needs not tempt <lb/>
us, nor seek to devour us; we take care to <lb/>
save him that labour, by wilfully continuing <lb/>
in his power; and if hereafter we shall think <lb/>
of repenting, we have already taken care that <lb/>
he shall not want matter for a temptation <lb/>
from our long impenitence. Yea, we give <lb/>
him so sure hold of us, that we shall not easily <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">N 4</fw>
                  <pb n="14"/>  
                  <lb/>
break loose from him. We have given <lb/>
him so long experience of our yielding temper, <lb/>
that he is never to seek how to fit our <lb/>
humour with a suitable Temptation; neither <lb/>
can he doubt of always prevailing, where he <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="prevail'd" auto="true">prevailed</normalised> so often. Hitherto he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="befool'd" auto="true">befooled</normalised> us, by persuading us <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> always too <lb/>
soon to grow wise; and having been fools <lb/>
so long, he will the more easily persuade us <lb/>
hereafter, because with a fairer colour of reason, <lb/>
that it is then too late. <lb/>
How many of our temper <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> the Devil <lb/>
got into Hell already, by persuading them <lb/>
<normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> already too soon, till they find it too late? <lb/>
What would those miserable Souls, who have <lb/>
been thus <normalised orig="befool'd" auto="true">befooled</normalised> into Torments, now give, <lb/>
if they had it, for such an opportunity of repenting <lb/>
as we now have? O why then should <lb/>
we now lose the opportunity we have, and <lb/>
giddily venture thereby suddenly to fall into <lb/>
that remediless condition they are now in? <lb/>
The next day, or hour, for ought we know, <lb/>
may lodge us for ever with them in Hell; and <lb/>
then shall we have weeping, and wailing and <lb/>
gnashing of teeth for evermore. Those tears of <lb/>
Repentance, which will not then quench, <lb/>
might now prevent those unquenchable <lb/>
Flames from taking hold of us. <lb/>
O that we could every day really imagine <lb/>
our selves under the stroke of Death! and <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">192</fw>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
that the apprehension thereof might awake us <lb/>
into a serious consideration of that Eternal <lb/>
State we then must enter into! What haste <lb/>
would we then be in to make as sure as we <lb/>
could of escaping those dreadful Torments, <lb/>
the very thoughts whereof seem torment enough? <lb/>
What strange Agonies of Soul have <lb/>
many dying sinners fallen into, who have lived <lb/>
jovially all their days? What thoughts have <lb/>
some of us, it may be, had, when in some <lb/>
fit of sickness we apprehended Death approaching <lb/>
near us? How penitent, how religious <lb/>
<normalised orig="seem'd" auto="true">seemed</normalised> we then to grow all on a sudden! <lb/>
How came we to be of such a different temper <lb/>
then, from that which we were in before? O, <lb/>
we saw our selves, in all appearance, then just <lb/>
on the very brink of Eternity; we thought <lb/>
our selves just stepping into Hell, if we repented <lb/>
not; and then we thought it time to repent <lb/>
indeed, and that it stood us upon as much <lb/>
as our Souls were worth to make haste. And <lb/>
may we not be this moment, for ought we <lb/>
know, in the very same danger that we then <lb/>
thought our selves in? Do we know, any of us, <lb/>
that there is so much as one day, or one hour, <lb/>
betwixt this moment and Eternity? And why <lb/>
then are we not now in as great haste to repent, <lb/>
as we were in then? How many that <lb/>
delay from time to time, are, when they least <lb/>
fear it, <normalised orig="knock'd" auto="true">knocked</normalised> down with a sudden blow? <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">193</fw>
                  <pb n="16"/> 
                  <lb/>
How many are cut off in the very act of sin, <lb/>
when secure in themselves, and thinking on <lb/>
no such thing as dying, they were in Hell before <lb/>
they thought that death was near them? <lb/>
Is not our delaying our Repentance the likeliest <lb/>
way in the World to provoke Almighty <lb/>
God to send out one of these swift Arrows to <lb/>
destroy us? O let us be ready, for it may come <lb/>
in an hour that we think not. Whilst we so <lb/>
confidently promise our selves to morrow, and <lb/>
flatter our selves with purposes of repenting <lb/>
then, a sudden destruction, a <normalised orig="Phrenzy" auto="true">Frenzy</normalised>, a stupidity, <lb/>
or we know not what, may arrest us, <lb/>
and not give us leave so much as to think that <lb/>
we are Sinners; or to say, Lord have mercy <lb/>
on us. <lb/>
<normalised orig="Doth" auto="true">Does</normalised> not God seem, for this very reason, to <lb/>
conceal both the time, and the manner of our <lb/>
death from us, that we may be the more watchful, <lb/>
and take the more care to be always ready <lb/>
for dying at whatever hour, or in whatever <lb/>
way it shall please him to take us hence? <lb/>
Did we certainly know before-hand, just <lb/>
when, and how we must die, we would <lb/>
venture the more boldly to spend our time <lb/>
in sin and vanity, till we knew the time <lb/>
was near; and then it may be some few days <lb/>
before, become a little more serious; just as it <lb/>
is the <choice ana="illegible">

have us to know the time of our death, that <lb/>
we not knowing but it may be to morrow, <lb/>
may be every day ready; and so he may have <lb/>
the honour, and we the comfort of a pious life. <lb/>
Moreover, as was before said, To continue <lb/>
in sin, in hopes that we may repent hereafter, <lb/>
as it is to <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 6.1">sin that grace may abound</quote>, which is a thing <lb/>
(if we believe the Apostle) greatly to be <lb/>
abhorred, <normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>. VI. 1 So is it the most effectual <lb/>
course we can take to shorten our days, and to <lb/>
prevent the benefit we hope for. <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 10.27-28">The fear of the <lb/>

shall perish</quote>, Prov. X. 27, 28. <lb/>
Again, We can hardly give any rational <lb/>
account, why God should so strictly, and <lb/>
under so severe Penalties enjoin us the practice <lb/>
of many excellent <normalised orig="Vertues" auto="true">Virtues</normalised>, and forbid us many <lb/>
foul Sins, if we may hope to please him, <lb/>
and be saved by a very late, or death-bed Repentance. <lb/>
Can such <normalised orig="Vertues" auto="true">Virtues</normalised> as Sobriety, Temperance <lb/>
and Chastity, and many more, be <lb/>

of a sick and dying man? Can the Sins of <lb/>

Wantonness, <normalised orig="Murther" auto="true">Murder</normalised>, Theft, Ambition, Covetousness, <lb/>
and more such like, be forbidden <lb/>

Sickness; when <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> somewhat hard to conceive, <lb/>
how a man should have any thoughts <lb/>
of them? Or can we conceive, that the meaning <lb/>
of such Commands is no more but this; <lb/>
You must either do these Duties, and avoid <lb/>
these Sins, while you live, or repent that you <lb/>
have not done so, when you are about to die? <lb/>
What were this but to say, That all the Commands <lb/>
of holy living signify no more, but this, <lb/>
That a man may safely break them all whilst <lb/>
he <normalised orig="liveth" auto="true">lives</normalised>; if he can but keep them, when he <lb/>
can break them no more; or be sorry that he <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> broken them, when he is afraid he is just <lb/>
going to be <normalised orig="damn'd" auto="true">damned</normalised> for it; or resolve to keep <lb/>
them, when he thinks he can live no longer? <lb/>
What probability is there, that any Resolution <lb/>
of repenting hereafter, is sincere? We <lb/>
cannot absolutely resolve to repent hereafter, because <lb/>
we cannot certainly know that we shall <lb/>
live hereafter; and if we resolve but conditionally, <lb/>
to repent hereafter, that is, on supposition <lb/>
that we shall live to repent, we must seem <lb/>
content to be <normalised orig="damn'd" auto="true">damned</normalised>, if we <normalised orig="dye" auto="true">die</normalised> before that <lb/>
time come, because we know, That without <lb/>
Repentance we must be <normalised orig="damn'd" auto="true">damned</normalised>. I think one <lb/>
cannot in good earnest resolve to repent, unless <lb/>
he immediately do repent, when he resolves <lb/>
upon it. How can any one imagine it too soon <lb/>
to do what he knows necessary to be done, <lb/>
and yet may never be done, if not just now? <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">196</fw>

                  <lb/>
No man can with any colour of reason be <lb/>
thought in earnest, when he saith he <normalised orig="resolveth" auto="true">resolves</normalised> <lb/>
to do that another day, which he knows <lb/>
is to be done every day, and must of necessity <lb/>
be done sometime, and yet he knows not whether <lb/>
he shall have another day or no. It's plain, <lb/>
such a man <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not resolve at all to repent, <lb/>
for he loves it not, and that's the reason he <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <lb/>
it not now, and will still be as good a reason not <lb/>
to do it then; but in truth, all he resolves upon, <lb/>
is, not to repent now, or to drive it off yet <lb/>
longer, and that's no resolution at all to repent. <lb/>
What folly is it to drive off our Repentance, <lb/>
till we be scourged and <normalised orig="lash'd" auto="true">lashed</normalised> unto it? <lb/>
If we make not haste of our selves, and God <lb/>
have yet any kindness left in store for us, he <lb/>
will whip us to it. If we will not otherwise <lb/>
awake out of sleep, God, if he have not already <lb/>
<normalised orig="determin'd" auto="true">determined</normalised> we shall sleep on unto death, <lb/>
will awake us with his Rod. And whether <lb/>
had the Prodigal better have staid in his Father's <lb/>
House, and continued in his Love, and <lb/>
under his constant Care and Providence, by <lb/>
obeying him at first; or have <normalised orig="wandred" auto="true">wandered</normalised> abroad, <lb/>
as he did, till extreme want and ill usage drove<lb/>
him home? If we will be saved, we must repent; <lb/>
and is it not a very foolish thing to stay <lb/>
till the whip drive us to it? Especially when <lb/>
<normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> doubtful, whether or no the Repentance <lb/>
which begins in Fear, will end in Love, which <lb/>

yet if it do not, it will never bring us to Salvation. <lb/>
And now after all this, I hope none will be <lb/>
so foolish as to flatter themselves with a vain <lb/>
conceit of their being Penitents, when they are <lb/>
not; or to encourage themselves with as vain <lb/>
hopes of repenting hereafter, whereof they <lb/>
can have no certainty. We find indeed one <lb/>
Example of a dying Penitent in the Scripture, <lb/>
who was accepted of God, and we find no <lb/>
more but one, that of <normalised orig="thr" auto="false">the</normalised> Thief upon the <lb/>
Cross. But alas! he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> afforded but very <lb/>
small Encouragement to any delaying Sinner, <lb/>
by his own happiness in being crucified <lb/>
by the side of his Saviour. Here is, as I <lb/>
said, but one single Example, and yet had <lb/>
there been ten thousand such as this one was, <lb/>
I do not see how they could any more encourage <lb/>
a considering man to delay his Repentance <lb/>
one hour, because no one knows whether <lb/>
after that hour he shall have so much <lb/>
time as that Malefactor had to Repent in, tho <lb/>
it was very short, or whether in that short <lb/>
time he shall repent as he did. Had never <lb/>

                  <lb/>
because once it fell out that some such Offender <lb/>
was <normalised orig="pardon'd" auto="true">pardoned</normalised>? Indeed it will follow <lb/>
hence, that such a Pardon may possibly be <lb/>
<normalised orig="obtain'd" auto="true">obtained</normalised>, because it was <normalised orig="obtain'd" auto="true">obtained</normalised>: but it <lb/>

be <normalised orig="obtain'd" auto="true">obtained</normalised>, because it never was any more <lb/>
than once <normalised orig="obtain'd" auto="true">obtained</normalised>, that we know of. Besides, <lb/>
This is indeed an Example of a late Repentance; <lb/>
and many Examples of a late Repentance <lb/>
there are besides this, though hardly <lb/>
another of one so late: but we are not sure <lb/>
it is an Example of a delayed Repentance; for <lb/>
we cannot find that this late Penitent ever one <lb/>
minute delayed his Repentance after he was <lb/>
called to it, and convinced that it was his <lb/>
duty. And indeed, seeing this man's case was <lb/>
very extraordinary, he that would encourage <lb/>
himself by it, ought first to see that his own <lb/>
Case, in all considerable circumstances, be <lb/>
like unto it. <lb/>
If any one ask, What course is to be taken <lb/>
by those who have long <normalised orig="delay'd" auto="true">delayed</normalised> their Repentance, <lb/>
but are not yet in appearance near unto <lb/>
death? I know not what better Advice to <lb/>
give him than this: That he delay it no longer, <lb/>
but make all the haste that possibly he can <lb/>
to repent now: And by how much the more <lb/>
time he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> already lost, let him use so much <lb/>
the more care and diligence to improve that <lb/>
little which is yet behind, to his best advantage. <lb/>

                  <lb/>
Such an one had need to give himself, <lb/>
in a manner, wholly henceforward to this <lb/>
great Work, and should not suffer any business <lb/>
that he can well shun, to disturb him in <lb/>
it. He should not now grudge to pinch himself <lb/>
of time in relation to all bodily and <lb/>
worldly Concerns, as much as he did God <lb/>
and his own Soul before; or to bestow <lb/>
as much upon these, if he can possibly, as he <lb/>
used to do upon those. No self-examination, <lb/>
no humiliation, no prayers, no tears, no striving <lb/>
to do good, can be too much. He had <lb/>
need to do almost nothing else but bewail his <lb/>
sinful life, denying himself all the Pleasures, <lb/>
and all the Comforts of this World, save only <lb/>
the necessary supports of life. This seems to <lb/>
me the least he can do, to satisfy himself of <lb/>
the sincerity of so late a Repentance, or to lay <lb/>
a foundation for a comfortable hope of God's <lb/>
acceptance. I shall now conclude the whole <lb/>
Discourse with those words, Isa. LV. 6, 7. <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 55.6-7">Seek <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> the Lord while he may be found, call <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> <lb/>
