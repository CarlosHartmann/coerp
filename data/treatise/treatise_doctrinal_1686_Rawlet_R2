IT's very sad to consider, not only how few Nations <lb/>
there <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>a*e</sic>
                     <corr>are</corr>

                  </choice> 
                  <lb/>
Christianity, but also of those who do profess <lb/>
it, how few there are comparatively that live <lb/>
according to their Profession. Wherefore it <lb/>
well beseems all Christs faithful servants, especially the <lb/>
Ministers of his Gospel, to use their utmost endeavours, <lb/>
by Life and Doctrine, by <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> and private <lb/>
Exhortations, by preaching and writing, and by all <lb/>
the ways they are capable, to promote true Piety <lb/>
and Holiness amongst all sorts of Men, whether high <lb/>
or low, rich or poor, without which no Man can <lb/>
be happy, either in this World, or that to come. <lb/>
And though I well know that, thanks be to God, <lb/>
we abound with multitudes of excellent Books written <lb/>
to this end; yet are not such short Instructions as <lb/>
these that follow to be condemned as useless, since <lb/>
they will, it's like, be more generally dispersed, and <lb/>
that amongst the very meanest of the People, and <lb/>
may more easily be read and <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised> by such as <lb/>
have neither time to read large Books, nor Money to <lb/>
buy them. With such as these I have occasion often <lb/>

                  <lb/>
to meet, and for their sakes chiefly it is that I publish <lb/>
this little Paper; being encouraged thereto by <lb/>
some pious Persons, both of City and <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised>, who <lb/>
intend to give some of them away to poor people <lb/>
about them, and thought others might do the like. <lb/>
And may it please God to give a Blessing to such a <lb/>
mean Undertaking as this, and succeed it to the good <lb/>
of Souls, I shall little regard the Censures of the curious: <lb/>
<normalised orig="Remembring" auto="true">Remembering</normalised> the saying I have somewhere met <lb/>
with of a devout Writer to this purpose, That he <lb/>
was desirous his Books should be scattered abroad <lb/>
upon <normalised orig="Pedlers" auto="true">Peddlers</normalised> Stalls, and thence come into the hands <lb/>
of common People, for the <normalised orig="encreasing" auto="true">increasing</normalised> of Knowledge <lb/>
and Piety, rather than be solemnly laid up and buried <lb/>
in the Libraries of the learned. <lb/>
Wherefore without any more <choice ana="print-error">

                     <corr>Preface</corr>

                     <corr>whether</corr>
                  </choice> it has been your care and study to <lb/>
live in such a godly manner as becomes those who <lb/>
are <normalised orig="baptized" auto="true">baptised</normalised> into the Name of Christ, and after him <lb/>
are called Christians. Have you well considered what <lb/>
is the meaning of this Name, and what Engagement <lb/>
you lie under to an Holy Life by taking it upon you in <lb/>
Baptism? And do you keep well in mind your Baptismal <lb/>
Vow, wherein you renounced the Devil, <lb/>
the World and the Flesh, and promised to be Christ's <lb/>
faithful <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised> and Servants, and so to continue all <lb/>
the days of your Life? Have you so far understood <lb/>
and considered these things, that you have made it <lb/>
your chief business to walk accordingly? Do you <lb/>
watch carefully and <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>sight</sic>
                     <corr>fight</corr>
                  </choice> manfully against your spiritual <lb/>
Enemies? Do you live as those that believe <lb/>
the Gospel, sincerely endeavouring in all things to <lb/>
know the Will of God and do it? Since you take <lb/>
Christ's Name into your mouth, are you careful to <lb/>
depart from all iniquity? In a word, is this your <lb/>
greatest study and design to please and <normalised orig="glorifie" auto="true">glorify</normalised> God, <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/> 
                  <lb/>
and to work out your own salvation? If your Conscience <lb/>
can truly witness for you, that it is indeed so; <lb/>
and that wherein at any time you fall short or do amiss, <lb/>
you are heartily grieved for it, and do daily labour <lb/>
to amend and grow better: If it be thus with you; <lb/>
I say, then bless God for his grace and mercy, hold on <lb/>
and prosper, and fear not but God will be with you, <lb/>
He will own you as his Children, and for his Son <lb/>
Jesus sake, will both pardon your sins and assist you <lb/>
by his Grace; he will guide you by his Counsel, and <lb/>
at length receive you to Glory. <lb/>
But pray deal faithfully with your own Souls and <lb/>
tell me, Has it not been quite otherwise with you? <lb/>
Have you not contented your selves with the bare Name <lb/>
and Profession of Christianity, and in the mean time <lb/>
led an ill course of Life, directly contrary to your <lb/>
Profession? Have you not lived in wilful ignorance of <lb/>
your Duty, or in gross sins against your Knowledge? <lb/>
Do not the temptations of the Devil, the allurements <lb/>
of the World and the Flesh many times prevail more <lb/>
with you than the Commands of Almighty God and <lb/>
the voice of your own Conscience? Are you not <lb/>
wont to neglect God's worship and service, both in <lb/>
the Church and at home? yea, do you not profane his <lb/>
holy Name by swearing and cursing? Are you not <lb/>
often guilty of lying and <normalised orig="slandring" auto="false">slandering</normalised>, of cozening and <lb/>
cheating, if not of downright stealing? Do you not <lb/>
in your anger use railing and reviling Language? Or <lb/>
do you not live in Envy and Malice, seeking for revenge <lb/>
of those that have done you any injury? Do <lb/>
you not allow your selves in Drunkenness or Whoredom, <lb/>
or some other known and wilful sin? To be <lb/>
short, Is there not something or other in this World <lb/>
that you love more than you do God himself and his <lb/>
Son Jesus? Are you not much more concerned for <lb/>
your Bodies than for your precious Souls? And do <lb/>
you not more earnestly seek after Food and Raiment, <lb/>
and the good things of this Life, than after that eternal <lb/>
Kingdom of Glory which God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> promised to his <lb/>
faithful Servants in the World to come? <lb/>
                  <lb/>

                  <pb n="3"/> 
                  <lb/>
If this indeed be your Case, I beseech you make a <lb/>
stand, and consider well what you have been doing; <lb/>
what a sad and dangerous condition you have brought <lb/>
your selves into, and what the end of it will be if <lb/>
you hold on in such evil courses. Humbly beg of <lb/>
God to make you duly sensible of your sin and danger, <lb/>
and to keep the sense thereof so close to your minds, <lb/>
that you may be brought not only to mourn for your <lb/>
sins, but to loath and abhor them, and utterly to forsake <lb/>
the same, henceforth resolving by the grace of <lb/>
God wholly to give up your selves to his service, and <lb/>
to walk <normalised orig="stedfastly" auto="true">steadfastly</normalised> in those holy and good ways which <lb/>
he has appointed you. This is that to which I do <lb/>
most earnestly desire to <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> you. And that I <lb/>
may do my utmost to prevail with you, I shall lay <lb/>
before you some very weighty Arguments, which <lb/>
I request you seriously to ponder of as you read them, <lb/>
and God grant they may have due effect upon the <lb/>
heart of every Reader. Amen. <lb/>
(1) That you may be prevailed with to become <lb/>
God's faithful servants, consider, first, That this was <lb/>
the great end for which God made you, and keeps you alive, <lb/>
and gives you so many mercies of all sorts. You can <lb/>
tell, I hope, that God made you, and that he made <lb/>
you to serve him, by living according to his Commandments. <lb/>
These are some of those first things <lb/>
which Children learn, and it were well if when they <lb/>
are grown up to be Men and Women, they would <lb/>
use seriously to think of them, and <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>pra*ise</sic>
                     <corr>practise</corr>
                  </choice> accordingly. <lb/>
The wise God has made all Creatures for some <lb/>
good end or other, and he has fitted them all for <lb/>
those ends and purposes for which he made them. <lb/>
To Man therefore has he given the use of Reason, <lb/>
chiefly to fit him for Religion, and to render him <lb/>
capable of knowing, loving and serving his great <lb/>
Creator and Benefactor: And it is Religion which <lb/>
makes the great difference betwixt a Man and a Beast: <lb/>
for <normalised orig="bruit" auto="true">brute</normalised> Creatures have no knowledge of God, no regard <lb/>
to him, but are wholly led by their senses, and <lb/>
mind <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>no*<normalised orig="hing" auto="true">hang</normalised></sic>
                     <corr>nothing</corr>
                  </choice> else but what is before them here in <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/> 
                  <lb/>
this World. But the poorest Man on Earth who has <lb/>
the use of his Reason, is near akin to the very Angels <lb/>
themselves; his nature is like theirs, and but a little <lb/>
below them, so that he may be much taken up in the <lb/>
same holy Works that they are employed in, even in <lb/>
loving and praising, and adoring the great and good <lb/>
God. To this end <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>h*</sic>
                     <corr>he</corr>
                  </choice> may study both the Works and <lb/>
the Word of God, which reveal him to us, and should <lb/>
continually put us in mind of him. And all the good <lb/>
things we enjoy should still make us sensible of the <lb/>
goodness of God from whom they come: and fill our <lb/>
hearts with love and thankfulness; and our mouths <lb/>
with blessing and praise. This is the most proper use of <lb/>
our Reason, and this God most justly expects from us <lb/>
Reasonable Creatures; and this even the poor man <lb/>
may render without any hindrance to his daily labours; <lb/>
and may still keep such an awful sense of God <lb/>
upon his mind as may restrain him from wilful sin, and <lb/>
make him careful always to please his Maker. And <lb/>
so our Reason was given us to bridle and govern <lb/>
our Appetites, our  <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>and Lusts</sic>
                     <corr>Lusts and</corr>
                  </choice> Passions; that we should <lb/>
not be led away into gluttony and drunkenness, into <lb/>
wantonness and uncleanness, nor into rage and fury like <lb/>
<normalised orig="bruit" auto="true">brute</normalised> Beasts that have no understanding: but should <lb/>
live soberly and <normalised orig="chastly" auto="true">chastely</normalised>, quietly and peaceably with <lb/>
all Men, doing them all the good we can. For such <lb/>
holy purposes as these chiefly was our Reason <normalised orig="bestow'd" auto="true">bestowed</normalised> <lb/>
on us, and therefore in this manner ought it to be <lb/>
<normalised orig="employ'd" auto="true">employed</normalised>. Certainly since God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> made us of a nature <lb/>
so much better than Birds or Beasts, he expects <lb/>
from us other works and services than he does from <lb/>
them. They know nothing of God that made them, <lb/>
nor have they any knowledge of another Life after this, <lb/>
but when they die there's an end of them: But to us <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> God given immortal Souls of more value than the <lb/>
whole World: and for this end <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> he created us, <lb/>
that we might serve and honour him here in this Life, <lb/>
and so may live with him, and enjoy him for ever in <lb/>
the World to come. <lb/>
Now if this be the end of our Creation, ought we <lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/> 
                  <lb/>
not to live up to it? Do we not see all other things answer <lb/>
the end for which they were made? The Sun gives <lb/>
Light by day, and the Moon by night. The Earth <lb/>
brings forth Corn and Grass, and the Trees bear Fruit. <lb/>
The Horse, the Cow and the Sheep, with many other <lb/>
Creatures, afford us much service and benefit. And <lb/>
shall Man alone be useless and unfruitful, and live to <lb/>
no good purpose? When they are all so ready to serve <lb/>
us, shall not we <normalised orig="chearfully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised> serve him that made us for <lb/>
his own service? Surely we cannot think that the wise <lb/>
God sent us into the World only to eat and drink, to <lb/>
sleep and play, or to work hard for a poor Livelihood. <lb/>
If this were all, we had better have been made <normalised orig="bruit" auto="true">brute</normalised> <lb/>
Creatures, or never have been made at all. Much less <lb/>
can we think that the Holy God made us on purpose <lb/>
to sin against him, to dishonour his Name, and provoke <lb/>
him to anger. He did not give us Reason to make <lb/>
us crafty and cunning for the World, that we might <lb/>
know how to cozen and cheat our Neighbours. He <lb/>
did not give us Tongues to swear and curse with, or <lb/>
to talk foolishly and filthily; let us not then use them <lb/>
to any such ill purposes. Since God has given us precious <lb/>
immortal Souls, let us not live like Beasts that <lb/>
perish, wallowing in the mire of base sensual Lusts <lb/>
and Pleasures. By this means we become worse than <lb/>
<normalised orig="Bruits" auto="true">Brutes</normalised> themselves, for we debase our own Natures, we <lb/>
abuse our Reason to our own shame and hurt, and to <lb/>
God's displeasure. Thus we cross the end of our Creation, <lb/>
and are more stupid and ungrateful than the very <lb/>
Ox or Ass: for they know their owner, and do good <lb/>
service to those that keep and feed them, Isa. 1. 2, 3. <lb/>
O let us not give God cause to complain of us, as he <lb/>
there does of the Jews, that he nourished and brought up <lb/>
Children, and they rebelled against him: Think how grievous <lb/>
it is to you that have Children, after all your <lb/>
care and kindness, after all your cost and labour, to <lb/>
have them prove stubborn and disobedient, loose and <lb/>
idle Prodigals. O see then that you be not such toward <lb/>
your heavenly Father, who made you and preserves <lb/>
you, and every day renews his mercies upon you. He <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">8</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/> 
                  <lb/>
keeps us alive and makes our lives comfortable. He <lb/>
gives and continues to us our Reason and Senses, our <lb/>
Health and Strength, Food and Raiment, and all the <lb/>
good things we enjoy. He supplies our wants, and helps <lb/>
us in all our distresses. He gives us light by day, and <lb/>
rest in the night. He enables us to follow our callings, <lb/>
and gives a blessing to our labours, that we may provide <lb/>
for our selves and Families. And does not this good God <lb/>
well deserve all the love and service which we can possibly <lb/>
render him? O how can we find in our hearts <lb/>
wilfully to offend him who thus delights in doing us <lb/>
good! Foolish and unthankful Wretches we are thus <lb/>
ill to require the Lord for all his loving kindness. <lb/>
We could not deal so with any Friend or Neighbour <lb/>
on Earth, that had been always kind and loving to <lb/>
us. Are not Servants bound to work for them who <lb/>
maintain them and pay them Wages? And ought not <lb/>
Children to obey their Parents who begot them and <lb/>
brought them up? How much more then ought we to <lb/>
obey God our Father, who gave us life at first, and <lb/>
still prolongs it from one day to another, when he <lb/>
could in a moment cut us off in our sins, and throw us <lb/>
into Hell. But in much mercy he spares us, and gives <lb/>
us space to Repent, and is very unwilling to destroy <lb/>
us, and therefore waits long to be gracious to us. O <lb/>
then let his patience and all his goodness at last have <lb/>
this happy effect upon us; let it lead us to true Repentance, <lb/>
and ever hereafter engage us to diligence <lb/>
and constancy in his service, <normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>. 2. 4. 2 Pet. 3. 9. <lb/>
(2.) To which purpose consider again that this was <lb/>
the end for which God sent his Son Jesus into the World, <lb/>
even to seek and save us lost and miserable sinners, to <lb/>
bring us to Repentance and newness of life, that so we <lb/>
might be restored to the love and favour of God, <lb/>
which we had lost by sinning against him. Our <lb/>
first Parents Adam and Eve were created in a <lb/>
very holy and happy Estate, but they fell from it <lb/>
by sinning against God, and so came all misery into <lb/>
the World. And then did our Heavenly Father <lb/>

                  <lb/>
to be our Saviour and Redeemer, to reform us <lb/>
from our Sins, and so to deliver us from misery: First <lb/>
he will make us Holy, and then we shall be made <lb/>
Happy. For as man lost his happiness by disobeying <lb/>
Gods command, so he must recover it by becoming <lb/>
obedient to his will in all things. To this end <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
the Lord Jesus fully revealed Gods will to us when <lb/>
we were in ignorance and darkness. He <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> given <lb/>
us holy precepts for the rule of our Life: And made <lb/>
most rich and precious promises to <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> us to <lb/>
our duty, and denounced dreadful <normalised orig="threatnings" auto="true">threatenings</normalised> to affright <lb/>
us from Wickedness. <lb/>
And when we had deserved the Wrath of God for <lb/>
our sins, then did Jesus Christ shed his most precious <lb/>
Blood to make Atonement for us, and to obtain our <lb/>
pardon and forgiveness. He <normalised orig="dyed" auto="true">died</normalised> for our offences <lb/>
and rose again for our justification. <normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>. 4. 25. And <lb/>
in his Gospel he has given full assurance of Gods good <lb/>
will to mankind, that he will be merciful to us and <lb/>
pardon us, if we truly repent of our sins and forsake <lb/>
them. Thus <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> Christ opened a door of hope for <lb/>
us, to encourage us to return to God: For if there <lb/>
had been no hopes of mercy, we should never have <lb/>
been drawn to Repentance, but even like the Devils <lb/>
themselves should have remained full of hatred and <lb/>
malice against God, utterly despairing of relief from <lb/>
him. But whilst the death of Christ does so much <lb/>
engage and encourage us to forsake our sins, it gives <lb/>
not the least encouragement to our continuance in them. <lb/>
Let us not think that Christ <normalised orig="dyed" auto="true">died</normalised> for our sins that we <lb/>
might have liberty to live in them, and yet be saved at <lb/>
the last. No, but he came to save us from our sins, not <lb/>
in them. He makes us blessed by turning us from our <lb/>
iniquities. He <normalised orig="dyed" auto="true">died</normalised> to redeem us from a vain and <lb/>
evil Conversation, to purify our Hearts and reform our <lb/>
Lives, and make us a peculiar People zealous of good <lb/>
works, Matt. 1. 21. Act. 3. 26. Tit. 2. 14. 1 Pet 1. 18. <lb/>
The death of Christ for us vile sinners <normalised orig="shews" auto="true">shows</normalised> the infinite <lb/>
love of God in finding out this way for our Salvation: <lb/>
But then it <normalised orig="shews" auto="true">shows</normalised> also what an evil thing sin <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">10</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/> 
                  <lb/>
is, and how hateful to God, since he would not pardon <lb/>
us without the suffering of his own dear Son on <lb/>
our account. And therefore if the consideration of all <lb/>
this does not bring us to hate and abhor our sins, and <lb/>
to love and serve our God and Saviour, we are never <lb/>
like to have any benefit by Christs death. All our <lb/>
professions of loving him and believing in him will <lb/>
stand us in no stead without obeying him. True saving <lb/>
Faith in Christ is that which works by love both <lb/>
to God and our Neighbour. Christ accounts none <lb/>
to be his friends but those that keep his Commandments, <lb/>
and to such only will he grant pardon and <lb/>
Salvation. Gal. 5. 6. Job. 15. 14. Heb. 5. 9. 1 Joh. <lb/>
3. 8. <lb/>
Since then the ever-blessed Jesus the Son of God <lb/>
came down from Heaven, became a Man, and <normalised orig="dyed" auto="true">died</normalised> <lb/>
a most painful death upon the Cross, that he might <lb/>
save us from sin and misery, shall we not accept of him <lb/>
as our Lord and Saviour, who comes to deliver us <lb/>
from the power of the Devil and our own Lusts, to <lb/>
make us the Children of God and heirs of Glory, <lb/>
which is a thousand times greater deliverance than <lb/>
that of the Israelites from the <normalised orig="Aegyptian" auto="true">Egyptian</normalised> bondage. Will <lb/>
you not be moved by all that Christ has done and <lb/>
suffered for you? Shall not his love constrain you to <lb/>
love him, and to hate all sin which was the cause of his <lb/>
sufferings? Will you tread under foot his most precious <lb/>
Blood, and even <normalised orig="crucifie" auto="true">crucify</normalised> him afresh, and again <lb/>
put him to open shame? Thus in some sort do wicked <lb/>
men use their Saviour, whilst they go on in their <lb/>
sins which are so displeasing to him. They that lie <lb/>
and cozen for a little gain; what do they but with Judas <lb/>
sell away Christ for Money. They that live in <lb/>
hatred and malice, and do mischief to their Neighbours, <lb/>
do in effect run the Spear into Christs side, and drive <lb/>
Nails into his hands and feet. And they that give <lb/>
themselves to Riot and Drunkenness, do even mingle <lb/>
Gall and Vinegar for him to drink. They do all that <lb/>
in them lies by their sinful pleasures to put him again <lb/>
into Agonies and Pains. But on the other hand, it is <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">11</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/> 
                  <lb/>
a delight to our Saviour to see us humbled for our <lb/>
sins, and resolved to forsake them. He will readily <lb/>
and effectually <normalised orig="interceed" auto="true">intercede</normalised> for us with our heavenly Father, <lb/>
who is most willing to receive returning Prodigals. <lb/>
There is joy in Heaven when sinners on Earth <lb/>
repent. Even this our return to God by true repentance <lb/>
is the best <normalised orig="recompence" auto="true">recompense</normalised> we can make to our Blessed <lb/>
Saviour for all his pains and sufferings. When <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 53.10">the pleasure of the Lord prospers in his hand</quote> by the conversion <lb/>
of sinners, <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 53.11">he then sees the travel of his Soul, and <lb/>
is satisfied</quote>, Isa. 63. 10. 11. And shall we not afford <lb/>
this satisfaction to our Redeemer, who <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> undergone <lb/>
so much for our sakes, and still out of his tender love <lb/>
to our Souls follows us with such earnest invitations <lb/>
to come to him for life and happiness? Could we <lb/>
deny him this most reasonable request, if we saw him <lb/>
now in person standing before us, beseeching us to <lb/>
turn and live? And this he now does by his Spirit <lb/>
and by his Ministers: But that leads me to the next. <lb/>
(3) Consider therefore that this also was the end for <lb/>
which the Holy Ghost is given, and all the means of grace <lb/>
afforded, even to <normalised orig="sanctifie" auto="true">sanctify</normalised> our hearts and make us an holy <lb/>
and obedient People. God knows the weakness and <lb/>
corruption of our Natures, and therefore in great <lb/>
mercy he affords the assistance of his holy Spirit, to <lb/>
enlighten our minds, and <normalised orig="purifie" auto="true">purify</normalised> our hearts, to renew <lb/>
and change our natures, and guide us in ways of <lb/>
holiness here, that so we may be fitted for eternal <lb/>
happiness with the most holy God in the life to come. <lb/>
Joh. 3. 3, 5. <normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>. 8. 9. And for this end were the holy <lb/>
Scriptures written by men assisted and inspired by <lb/>
the Holy Ghost, to be a light to our feet and a lantern <lb/>
to our path, to direct us in the plain way to everlasting <lb/>
life, 2 Tim. 3. 15, 16, 17. And the holy <lb/>
Sacraments were appointed for the <normalised orig="encrease" auto="true">increase</normalised> of grace <lb/>
to all that make a right use of them. And our Blessed <lb/>
Saviour did at first send abroad his Apostles to <lb/>
Preach the Gospel to all the World, and <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> ever <lb/>
since continued a succession of Ministers in his Church, <lb/>
whose standing office it is to <normalised orig="adminster" auto="false">administer</normalised> the word and <lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/> 
                  <lb/>
Sacraments, to watch over the Souls of the people, to <lb/>
instruct and admonish them both in <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> and private, <lb/>
and to use their utmost diligence to bring them to the <lb/>
knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus. And <lb/>
God is ever ready to accompany their endeavours with <lb/>
his blessing. Do you not often find his good Spirit putting <lb/>
good thoughts and motions into your mind, inclining you <lb/>
to that which is holy and good, checking and restraining <lb/>
you when you are running into evil? But on the other <lb/>
hand it's the evil Spirit, even the Devil himself, <lb/>
that tempts you to sin, and would hinder you from your <lb/>
Duty. It's the Devil that tempts men to pride and malice, <lb/>
and to all manner of wickedness. For he being <lb/>
a proud, malicious and most wicked Spirit, would have <lb/>
men to be like himself, that so they may be for ever miserable <lb/>
with him. Will you not then resist the Devil, <lb/>
the great enemy of your Souls, and be led and guided by <lb/>
Gods good Spirit, and follow his motions and the directions <lb/>
of his word which lead to happiness? O do not <lb/>
grieve this Blessed Spirit, who alone can give us true <lb/>
comfort, do not resist and quench his motions, nor provoke <lb/>
him to depart from you, and leave you to your <lb/>
own lusts, and to the power of Satan, who seeks your <lb/>
ruin. <lb/>
Moreover, as the Devil has his instruments to draw <lb/>
men to wickedness, one ill Man tempting another, so <lb/>
Ministers are sent from God to draw you to righteousness <lb/>
and holiness. They are the <normalised orig="Embassadors" auto="true">Ambassadors</normalised> and Messengers <lb/>
of Christ, and do in his name beseech you to <lb/>
be reconciled to God, who is most willing to be reconciled <lb/>
to you, if you will but cast away those wicked <lb/>
works which provoke him to anger, 2 Cor. 5. 20. O <lb/>
how will it <normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised> the hearts of your Ministers that truly <lb/>
love your Souls, to see the success of their labours, <lb/>
to have you come to them enquiring what you must do <lb/>
to be saved, declaring your repentance for your former <lb/>
evil Courses, and your resolution henceforth to become <lb/>
new Creatures. Certainly we exhort you to nothing but <lb/>
what is highly reasonable and for your own benefit, <lb/>
whilst we <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> you to return to the favour of God. <lb/>
Why then will you not hearken to us? If a message of mercy <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">B</fw>
                  <pb n="11"/> 
                  <lb/>
should be sent you from the King, when you were in <lb/>
danger of death for Rebellion, would you not most gladly <lb/>
and thankfully receive it? And will you not be as thankful <lb/>
and obedient to the King of kings, and as wise to <lb/>
save your Souls as to preserve your Bodies. <lb/>
And beside his Word and Ministers, God also pleads <lb/>
with you by his <normalised orig="providences" auto="true">providence</normalised> to bring you to repentance. <lb/>
Sometimes he sends afflictions to correct you for <lb/>
your faults, to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> you the evil of sin, and draw you <lb/>
home to himself; and at other times he sends many <lb/>
mercies, as I have told you, to soften your hearts, to <lb/>
engage and allure you to his service: And such good <lb/>
use we ought to make of all Gods dealings with us. <lb/>
(4.) Consider further what engagements you <normalised orig="ly" auto="true">lie</normalised> under <choice ana="illegible">

                  <lb/>
an holy life by your own profession, promises and vows. You <lb/>
profess and call your selves Christians, the Disciples and <lb/>
followers of Christ: Ought you not then to follow his <lb/>
example, and obey his Commands, if you will make good <lb/>
that name? You would think it a great disgrace not to <lb/>
be taken for a Christian but for a Turk or Jew. Beware <lb/>
then lest you bring this disgrace upon your selves <lb/>
by an unchristian temper of mind, and ill course <choice ana="illegible">

life. If you are false or cruel, Covetous or Lustful, like <lb/>
a Turk or Jew, it matters little what you call your <lb/>
selves. He is not a Christian that's one outwardly, but <lb/>
he that has the same mind and spirit that was in <choice ana="illegible">

                  <lb/>
Jesus. God will not at the last day judge of men by <lb/>
their names and titles, but by their hearts and lives. <lb/>
Only it will go much worse with a man that calls himself <lb/>
a Christian, and yet lives like an Heathen or Infidel. <lb/>
And pray consider how by your Baptism you are solemnly <lb/>
listed under Christs banner, to fight against the <lb/>
Devil, the World and the Flesh: and by the keeping <lb/>
this vow you <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> your selves to be Christians indeed. <lb/>
But if you are led away by the temptations of Satan <lb/>
and do his works, and are ensnared by the vanities of the <lb/>
World, the lusts and pleasures of the Flesh, you do in <lb/>
effect renounce your Baptism. <lb/>
Besides this, have you not renewed this same vow <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>a*</sic>
                     <corr>at</corr>
                  </choice> 
                  <lb/>
the Holy Communion, there openly professing your belief <lb/>
in Christ crucified, and promising obedience to him? <lb/>
                  <pb n="12"/> 
                  <lb/>
If you have not received this Holy Sacrament, though <lb/>
you have long been at years of discretion, you then <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> <lb/>
your selves by this neglect to be no obedient Disciples <lb/>
of Christ, since you do not obey his plain command to <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Lk 22.19">do this in remembrance</quote> of him, <normalised orig="Luk" auto="true">Luck</normalised>. 22. 19. And indeed I <lb/>
fear that many careless people will not come to the <lb/>
Communion, because they think it would bind them to <lb/>
lead such a strict and holy life as they have no mind to. <lb/>
But do not they cast off Jesus Christ from being their <lb/>
Master, who look upon his commands as too strict and <lb/>
severe, and will not promise to obey him? Yea do they not <lb/>
thereby even disown their Baptism, by which they were <lb/>
bound to this obedience? So that the same reason which <lb/>
keeps them from the Communion, it's like would keep <lb/>
them from being <normalised orig="Baptized" auto="true">Baptised</normalised>, if it were yet to be done. <lb/>
And what sort of Christians are they that would reject <lb/>
Christian Baptism, because it engages them to an holy <lb/>
life? <lb/>
If you are not guilty of this neglect, but do sometimes <lb/>
come to the Lords Supper, to keep up the remembrance <lb/>
of his death and sufferings: Then pray consider that by <lb/>
receiving this holy Sacrament, you do solemnly renew <lb/>
your vows to be Christ's faithful Servants and Disciples, <lb/>
and to walk in sincere obedience to all his holy Laws, <lb/>
as you hope for Salvation by his death. Wherefore <lb/>
may I not well beseech you to use all due care to live <lb/>
according to this your promise and engagement. What <lb/>
a shame is it for a Man to be false to his word, much <lb/>
more to his Oath? O do not then break that Oath which <lb/>
you have made to God himself by taking this holy Sacrament. <lb/>
And call to mind if you have not sometimes <lb/>
on a Sick-bed, or in some great danger made the same <lb/>
promise and vow: And has not God spared you to see how <lb/>
you would perform the same? Take heed then of abusing <lb/>
his mercy and breaking your promise. <lb/>
Moreover, I might <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> how your professing to believe <lb/>
the Creed engages you to live well, according to <lb/>
the holy faith you profess, which is a doctrine according <lb/>
to godliness. <lb/>
But, lastly, the very prayers you put up to God lay <lb/>
the same engagement on you, even to serve and <choice ana="illegible">

that his <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 6.9">name may be hallowed, his Kingdom come, and <lb/>
his will done in Earth as it is in Heaven</quote>, ought we not <lb/>
our selves to honour his name, and advance his Kingdom, <lb/>
by obeying his Laws, and by doing his will constantly <lb/>
and <normalised orig="chearfully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised> as the Angels do in Heaven, to be utmost <lb/>

not to pray to him who alone can hear and help us, and to <lb/>
give thanks and praise to him who is the Father of mercies? <lb/>
Is it not most reasonable that Children should obey their <lb/>
Parents, and Subjects their Rulers? and that all men <lb/>
should live in peace and love with one another, and <lb/>
speak truly, and deal honestly as they would be dealt <lb/>
with? Is it not most fit and decent for a Man to eat and <lb/>
drink moderately, so as makes most for his health? To <lb/>
be modest and <normalised orig="chast" auto="true">chaste</normalised> in all his conversation? Will not <lb/>
every Mans own Reason acknowledge the equity and fitness <lb/>
of these and the like precepts? And for some that do <lb/>
seem more severe, there may be given very good reason <lb/>
for them also. So that plainly all Gods commands are <lb/>
the wise and wholesome counsels of a most tender Father, <lb/>
who forbids his Children nothing but what's hurtful, <lb/>
and requires nothing of them but what makes for <lb/>
their own good, even <quote type="biblical" ana="Mic 6.8">to deal justly, to love mercy, and <lb/>
to walk humbly with their God</quote>, Mic. 6. 8. <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 11.30">Christs Yoke is <lb/>
<normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> and his burden light</quote>, Matt. 11. 30. Gods service is <lb/>
perfect freedom, as we daily stile it in our prayers. And <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Jn 5.3">his commandments are not grievous</quote>, 1 Joh. 5. 3. Shall we <lb/>
not then be so dutiful to our heavenly Father, yea so <lb/>
wise for our own good as to obey these most reasonable <lb/>
and gracious laws which he has given us? So just and <lb/>
equal they are, that we cannot break them without offering <lb/>
a kind of violence to our selves, and going contrary <lb/>
to the reason of our own mind. They are <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 19.8">light to <lb/>
the eyes</quote> and <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 19.8">joy to the heart</quote>, <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 19.10">sweeter to a good Man than <lb/>
honey and the honey-comb</quote>, as the Psalmist oft speaks. As <lb/>
suitable are Gods commands to our natures, and as useful <lb/>
and healthful to our Souls as the most wholesome <lb/>
food to our Bodies. And for a Man to direct his whole <lb/>
carriage and behaviour according to the laws of God, is <lb/>
as much his wisdom as it is to go <normalised orig="cloathed" auto="true">clothed</normalised> in decent <lb/>
Apparel, and to eat and drink what is good for his <lb/>
nourishment. But on the other hand, for one to run <lb/>
naked about the Streets, to fill his mouth with mire and <lb/>
Dirt, to cut and mangle his own Flesh, is not a greater <lb/>
sign of folly and madness, than for a Man to live according <lb/>
to his own lusts, rather than after the laws of God, <lb/>
which are so agreeable to our Reason, and do so plainly <lb/>

conduce to our own truest interest and advantage, both in <lb/>
this Life, and that to come, as will appear by what follows. <lb/>
(6.) Consider therefore in the next place, that it is a <lb/>
most certain truth, That the leading of an holy and good <lb/>
Life, is in all respects very greatly for a Man's own benefit <lb/>
and comfort, even in this present World. <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Tim 4.8">Godliness is profitable <lb/>
for all things</quote>. It makes for the quiet of our Minds, <lb/>
the health of our Bodies, the <normalised orig="encrease" auto="true">increase</normalised> of our Estates, and <lb/>
procures us much credit and esteem, much love and good <lb/>
will among our Neighbours. Yea, it commonly brings <lb/>
along with it all manner of Blessings, and makes the enjoyment <lb/>
of them more sweet and pleasant, and keeps off <lb/>
a great deal of trouble which wicked men bring upon <lb/>
themselves, and affords much support and ease under <lb/>
those afflictions which the providence of God may lay <lb/>
upon us. <normalised orig="Insomuch" auto="true">Inasmuch</normalised> that no Man of what rank and condition <lb/>
<normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised>, can lead a truly comfortable Life, except <lb/>
he lead an holy and good life. All this is frequently <lb/>
taught in Scripture, and may easily be manifested by clear <lb/>
Reason: Or if that be not sufficient, it is also most plainly <lb/>
to be discerned by daily experience, that they who truly <lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>f*r</sic>
                     <corr>fear</corr>
                  </choice> God, have much more peace and comfort in this <lb/>
World, than wicked and loose livers, that make no <lb/>
Conscience of their Ways. <lb/>
If I should make the comparison only betwixt a sober <lb/>
Man and a Drunkard, which do you think has the better <lb/>
of it in this Life? How often do the great drinkers not <lb/>
only waste their Estates, but destroy their Health, weaken <lb/>
their Brains, and shorten their Lives? How often do <lb/>
they fall into quarrels, get wounds and bruises, and sometimes <lb/>
death it self, either by fighting or by one sad accident <lb/>
or other. Sometimes the very Children in the <lb/>
streets run after them, shouting and making sport with <lb/>
them. And if you follow them to their own Homes, what <lb/>
disturbance and mischief do they make there? what <lb/>
swearing and cursing, what brawling and scolding, what <lb/>
quarrelling and fighting is there? What outcries and lamentations <lb/>
do Wife and Children make? who now perhaps <lb/>
are glad to get away for fear of their Lives, as before <lb/>
they sat starving for want of that Money which these <lb/>
ill Husbands waste in the Ale-house. (A sin and shame it <lb/>
                  <pb n="16"/> 
                  <lb/>
is to those that entertain them.) And after they have lived <lb/>
a while at this wild and wicked rate, the next news commonly <lb/>
is, that either for Debt or for Disorder they <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>a*e</sic>
                     <corr>are</corr>
                  </choice> 
                  <lb/>
laid up in Prison, and sometimes by those very People in <lb/>
whose Houses they drunk away all they got. And now <lb/>
are they forced to live upon Bread and Water, and linger <lb/>
out a miserable hungry Life, in a cold stinking Dungeon, <lb/>
till either the Charity of Friends, or Death it self release <lb/>
them thence. (And by the way, is this such a pleasant <lb/>
Life that it's worth being <normalised orig="damn'd" auto="true">damned</normalised> for to Hell-torments <lb/>
to all eternity? of which <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterwards</normalised>.) <lb/>
Thus also I might tell of the sad effects of Whoredom, <lb/>
which is commonly <normalised orig="follow'd" auto="false">followed</normalised> with poverty and disgrace, <lb/>
and many times with a filthy <normalised orig="loathsom" auto="true">loathsome</normalised> disease, which makes <lb/>
Men rot above ground. And thus, angry, proud, malicious, <lb/>
revengeful People are a continual torment to themselves <lb/>
and to all about them, and seldom have any peace or <lb/>
quiet either with their Neighbours or in their own Families. <lb/>
The like may be <normalised orig="shewn" auto="true">shown</normalised> of all other Vices which <lb/>
are still wont to bring their own punishment along with <lb/>
them; to say nothing of what is or ought to be <choice ana="illegible">

if they be followers of that which is good? Or what hurt does <lb/>
a man bring upon himself by living soberly and <normalised orig="chastly" auto="true">chastely</normalised>, <lb/>
by fearing God and honouring the King? What mischief <lb/>
does a man get by minding his own Business, and living <lb/>
quietly and peaceably amongst his Neighbours? Nay, <lb/>
how happily may we see even some of the meanest sort <lb/>
of People live, that are diligent in their Callings, and sober <lb/>
and temperate, and careful to please God, and keep <lb/>
a good Conscience in all their ways. Very seldom it is <lb/>
that they are pinched with much Want, or if they <choice ana="illegible">

                  <lb/>
fall into a low Condition, yet all good People that know <lb/>
them, are ready to pity and relieve them: and will often <lb/>
trust them with Money or Goods till they are able to pay. <lb/>
And every body is willing to employ an honest industrious <lb/>
Man, so that he shall seldom want Work or <lb/>
Trading. But idle, riotous People that follow whoring <lb/>
and drinking, gaming and cheating, and stealing, that <lb/>

                  <lb/>
neglect God's service and profane the Lord's day, being <lb/>
often in the Ale-house when they should be at Church; <lb/>
these are the People, if you observe it, that do commonly <lb/>
fall into the basest <normalised orig="beggery" auto="true">beggary</normalised> and misery; and men do <lb/>
but little pity them, because they brought it all upon themselves. <lb/>
O how happy might all sorts of People be, in a <lb/>
very great measure even at present, if they would but <lb/>
become truly Religious and good. It is their own sin <lb/>
and folly, their lusts and passions that occasion most of <lb/>
those troubles and miseries which they meet with; <lb/>
though I know they use to cry out of their hard fortune, <lb/>
and to lay the blame upon others, and sometimes to <normalised orig="murmure" auto="true">murmur</normalised> <lb/>
against God himself. But they consider not how <lb/>
they provoke God to anger daily by their <normalised orig="hainous" auto="true">heinous</normalised> sins, <lb/>
and therefore may justly feel his heavy judgments for <lb/>
the same, beside all the mischief which naturally follows <lb/>
upon wickedness. And this makes their Condition to be <lb/>
sad indeed that they are always liable to the wrath of <lb/>
God, and may justly expect his vengeance to fall upon <lb/>
them, and to strip them of all their Comforts, and throw <lb/>
them into the sorest Calamities. <lb/>
