                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
3. It must not be expected that I should explain <lb/>
the particular Commandments, which would too much <lb/>
swell this work; Only I shall undertake two things. <lb/>
First, To direct how to use them for our profit when <lb/>
there is no Communion. Secondly, And chiefly, how <lb/>
they may be used in private to help us in our Preparation <lb/>
for the Blessed Sacrament. <lb/>
As our natural Ignorance makes it necessary to teach <lb/>
us this Law of God in our Catechism: So our aptness <lb/>
to forget that which is good requires that it should be <lb/>
repeated in our <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Service. It is dangerous either <lb/>
not to know or not to remember these holy Commandments, <lb/>
which are proclaimed by our God, approved by <lb/>
our own Consciences, &amp; established <lb/>
with eternal rewards and punishments. <lb/>
Whosoever therefore <lb/>
thinks it a trouble to hear them <lb/>
so often, neither considers the <lb/>
weight of these divine Precepts, <lb/>
nor observes that his own frequent breaches of them <lb/>
do <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised>, that they are not read often enough to fix them <lb/>
so in his mind as to procure a sincere Obedience. For <lb/>
till we do exactly observe them, We do not know or <lb/>
remember them as we ought. Let us then endeavour <lb/>
so often as we use them to receive benefit to our Souls <lb/>
thereby. <lb/>
And to that purpose, First, You must with great <lb/>
humility receive them from the Mouth of the Minister, <lb/>
as if they were spoken from <normalised orig="Moutn" auto="false">mount</normalised> Sinai by God himself, <lb/>
(imitating the tenderness of good Josiah, 2 Chron. <lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
34. 19.) and cast your selves down upon your knees, <lb/>
for that is the most suitable posture for Criminals, who <lb/>
are to petition for pardon; and thus listen to every Commandment <lb/>
with diligent attention and a submissive Reverence. <lb/>
Secondly, Apply them every one carefully to <lb/>
your ways, for since you have neglected to follow the <lb/>
direction of this holy Law as your <lb/>
Guide, it now becomes your Accuser; <lb/>
and it may be an excellent opportunity to bring you to <lb/>
the knowledge of your sinful Estate, <lb/>
and so unto repentance, because <lb/>
your gracious God <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> allow <lb/>
you the liberty of second thoughts, and will not <lb/>
condemn you for these offences, if you condemn your <lb/>
selves for them. Ask then your own heart seriously at <lb/>
every one, Have I not been such an one? Done this <lb/>
evil? Neglected this duty? And when your Conscience <lb/>
Answers, Yes; then you must most passionately <lb/>
cry out, Lord have mercy upon me, and forgive me this <lb/>
or that sin. Thirdly, Let the discovery of so many <lb/>
breaches, and the sight of so vast a heap of guilt make <lb/>
you afraid to add Sin unto Sin, <lb/>
and to break these holy bonds <lb/>
any more, for therefore have <lb/>
you lived at random, because you <lb/>
have not considered your ways, <lb/>
nor compared them strictly with <lb/>
Gods sacred Law. But now that <lb/>
you are freshly minded of your Duty, and reproved <lb/>
for your former Neglect, It will be expected you shall <lb/>
be more afraid to transgress hereafter, and therefore desiring <lb/>
never more to offend, say, Lord incline my heart to <lb/>
keep this Law. And thus the hearing of the Ten <lb/>
Commandments may be an exercise of our Repentance, <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="13">12</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
and a means of amendment every day. <lb/>
4. It is of excellent use frequently to compare our <lb/>
ways with <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>GodsLaw</sic>
                     <corr>Gods Law</corr>
                  </choice>, for so it would be our guide before <lb/>
we act, to put us upon our Duty; Our reprover <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterwards</normalised>, <lb/>
to bring us to Repentance; and our Monitor to <lb/>
prevent the like misdoings for the future. But I am <lb/>
the briefer in this consideration, because my main design <lb/>
tends to the Holy Sacrament; And also because the <lb/>
Church <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> here placed the Ten Commandments principally <lb/>
as the Rule and Measure of that Examination <lb/>
which St. Paul makes to be necessary before we eat <lb/>
thereof, 1 Cor. 11. 28. For the same Apostle <normalised orig="teacheth" auto="true">teaches</normalised> <lb/>
us, that <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 3.20">by the Law is the knowledge of Sin</quote>, <normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>. 3. <lb/>
20. And experience also <normalised orig="sheweth" auto="true">shows</normalised> that there is no readier <lb/>
way to discover our iniquities and humble us for <lb/>
them, than the serious application of this exact Rule to <lb/>
our perverse and crooked paths. I shall therefore, <lb/>
Secondly, Give Directions how we may so try our ways <lb/>
by them, as to prepare our selves for this Heavenly <lb/>
Feast. To which purpose let it be considered, that this <lb/>
duty of Self Examination, is never so necessary, as <lb/>
now when we purpose to receive the Holy Communion: <lb/>
For it is buy <normalised orig="hypocrisie" auto="true">hypocrisy</normalised> to seek a pardon for sins <lb/>
which we never perceived our selves guilty of, and <lb/>
foolish presumption to make a Covenant before we have <lb/>
weighed the conditions to which we are to be obliged: <lb/>
Until we see the number and apprehend the heinousness <lb/>
of our transgressions, and fear the vengeance due <lb/>
unto us for them, we are altogether unfit for the Commemoration <lb/>
of his Death who suffered for our offences. <lb/>
It is the sight and sense of sin alone that will <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> us <lb/>
what need we have of so glorious a Redeemer. This <lb/>
will <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> us our obligation to Jesus, and teach us heartily <lb/>
to praise God for him, and passionately to beg an <lb/>
interest in him: <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> he that <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not discern his <lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
guilt, nor foresee his danger, is stupid and unmoved at <lb/>
this amazing spectacle of bleeding, languishing, <lb/>
dying Saviour, and <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> no love nor no fear, No tears <lb/>
nor no desires, No relenting or indignation for what is <lb/>
past, Nor any vows and wishes as to the time to come; <lb/>
and shall be judged an unworthy Receiver. So that if <lb/>
you desire comfort in, benefit from, or acceptance at <lb/>
the holy Table, I charge you to be exceeding curious and <lb/>
diligent in this Examination. <lb/>
Thy Pythagoreans and better sort of Heathens did <lb/>
strictly call themselves to an Account every night before <lb/>
they went to sleep, where they had been? what evil <lb/>
they had done? or what good they had left undone? <lb/>
And shall not they condemn those Christians who will <lb/>
not do the same once in a Month, or three or four times <lb/>
in a Year; especially upon so solemn an occasion, and <lb/>
for so excellent an end, as to procure a pardon sealed <lb/>
for all their misdemeanours? The <lb/>
<normalised orig="Rabbins" auto="true">Rabbis</normalised>, <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> the devouter <lb/>
Jews to spend a whole Month together <lb/>
before the Feast of Expiation, in examining all <lb/>
their lives, assuring them that all those offences which <lb/>
they discover shall be forgiven them in that great day: <lb/>
Which may more truly be applied to this Ordinance. <lb/>
That holy <normalised orig="Anchoret" auto="true">Anchorite</normalised> which the Patriarch of Alexandria <lb/>
found in the Egyptian <normalised orig="desarts" auto="true">deserts</normalised>, said, he had <normalised orig="imployment" auto="true">employment</normalised> <lb/>
enough there (where he had nothing else to divert him) <lb/>
for his whole life to judge and condemn himself. And <lb/>
shall not we be justly condemned of the Lord, who <lb/>
think a day or two, too much to be so <normalised orig="imployed" auto="true">employed</normalised>? But <lb/>
I hope I need add no more to <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> to so good a <lb/>
work. And therefore supposing this a sufficient Conviction <lb/>
to those who have any care of their Souls; I shall <lb/>
proceed to direct how we must examine our selves by <lb/>
these Commandments. <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="15">14</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
5. When the Minister gives warning of an approaching <lb/>
Communion, We must contrive to have at <lb/>
least one whole day separated to this so necessary Trying <lb/>
and judging our selves. And first, As this Law was <lb/>
given in the Wilderness, Exod. 19. 1. So we cannot use <lb/>
it in a crowd; but when we purpose thus to apply it, <lb/>
we must retire from the World, and <lb/>
lay aside all secular business, <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. <lb/>
4. 4. and carry our minds with <lb/>
us into some place of privacy, that <lb/>
we may wholly attend this great <lb/>
work, which will take up our whole time, and <normalised orig="imploy" auto="true">employ</normalised> <lb/>
all our faculties. For we <normalised orig="communciate" auto="true">communicate</normalised> so seldom, and <lb/>
generally live so <normalised orig="carelesly" auto="true">carelessly</normalised> between one time and another; <lb/>
that our Sins are numerous, our Consciences intricate, <lb/>
and many things forgotten, and all confused; <lb/>
So that it is not for us to <normalised orig="alledge" auto="true">allege</normalised> that the Primitive <lb/>
Christians did not use such solemnity of Preparation; <lb/>
For they lived strictly, received daily or weekly, and <lb/>
kept their Souls always in good Order: For which <lb/>
cause I suppose neither were the Commandments appointed <lb/>
to be read in the <normalised orig="Antient" auto="true">Ancient</normalised> Liturgies. Did we <lb/>
lead such lives, we might be accepted with lesser and <lb/>
shorter preparatives. But most of our hearts will tell us <lb/>
the case with us is far otherwise. Secondly, Having <lb/>
thus chosen a time and place for the undisturbed proceeding <lb/>
in this grand affair, we must resolve to spend <lb/>
it Fasting, Dan. 9. 3. not only that we may not be diverted, <lb/>
or lose any of this precious time by our meat, <lb/>
but that our minds may be more spiritual, and more <lb/>
clear, our body more gentle, and more at the command <lb/>
of the Spirit; that our hearts may <lb/>
be tender, and more apt to grieve <lb/>
for Sin, and fear Gods wrath; as <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="16">15</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
also that we may punish our flesh, for the gratifying of <lb/>
which, most of our Sins have been committed; that <lb/>
we may acknowledge our selves unworthy of our daily <lb/>
bread; And finally declare that we desire peace with <lb/>
God, more than our very food, and do so earnestly hunger <lb/>
and thirst after Jesus, that we forget our bodily sustenance. <lb/>
Thirdly, Begin this work with humble and <lb/>
hearty Prayer to him that sees your heart, and must be <lb/>
your Judge. Beseech him to help you to prevent his <lb/>
judgment by condemning your selves. Desire him to <lb/>
fix your thoughts, strengthen your memory, and to <lb/>
work upon your affections; that you may perceive how <lb/>
often, how heinously, and how long time you have offended, <lb/>
and may with a relenting wounded heart bewail <lb/>
the same. Fourthly, After this rise up, and meditate <lb/>
how merciful thy God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been, in not summoning <lb/>
thee to his Tribunal as yet, and in giving thee this <lb/>
opportunity to prevent a sad and final Doom. Remember <lb/>
thy heart is deceitful, and not willing to see its own <lb/>
baseness, or to discover its own shame, nor apt to <lb/>
censure it self aright. And yet <lb/>
cursed are they that do <quote type="biblical" ana="Jer 48.10">this work <lb/>
of the Lord deceitfully</quote>, Jer. 48. <lb/>
10. for it will be their own <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised>. <lb/>
Wherefore resolve to set about it <lb/>
with all possible sincerity and strictness, <lb/>
as believing thou <normalised orig="mayest" auto="true">may</normalised> never <lb/>
have another opportunity, but that thy next <normalised orig="Inditement" auto="true">Indictment</normalised> <lb/>
may be in another World; And in the mean time, <lb/>
that an All-seeing God will come in at this Feast, to inquire <lb/>
how faithfully thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> performed this Duty. <lb/>
And then <normalised orig="fifthly" auto="true">fiftly</normalised>, Set your self seriously to look over all <lb/>
the Records of your Memory and Conscience. Call to <lb/>
mind all Places you have been in, all Companies and <lb/>
Persons with which you have conversed. Reflect upon <lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
your designs, your business, your pleasure and divertisements, <lb/>
with all those circumstances which may represent <lb/>
unto you, all your evil thoughts, words, and <lb/>
actions, and may set before you all the good which you <lb/>
have omitted. And if any seem <lb/>
dubious, you must prove and try <lb/>
them, Lam. 3. 40. That you may <lb/>
condemn them in your judgment <lb/>
as well as recollect them by your <lb/>
memory. And do this as impartially <lb/>
as is possible, judging the same of your own <lb/>
Actions, as you would, if they were done by the worst <lb/>
of your Enemies. For your better help wherein the following <lb/>
Table is contrived. <lb/>

Have I not failed in any of the parts of Religious <lb/>

Have I not been indifferent and customary, as to my <lb/>

likely that he will now have the confidence to say as he, <lb/>
Matth. 19. 20. <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 19.20">All these have I kept from my youth</quote>. <lb/>
For his own Conscience will tell him in most inquiries <lb/>
that He is the Man; And accordingly the Church <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
provided the Publican Confession, Luke 18. 12. <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 123.3">Lord <lb/>
have mercy upon us</quote>. Which now may be fitly used, <lb/>
First, As an humble and dolorous <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>Con*ession</sic>
                     <corr>Confession</corr>
                  </choice>that we are <lb/>
Guilty, very Guilty; For when the Prisoner falls down <lb/>
and craves Mercy; It <normalised orig="shews" auto="true">shows</normalised> he is convinced of his <lb/>
fault, and in that phrase is supposed to acknowledge it. <lb/>
Secondly, As a passionate, and earnest Exclamation for <lb/>
Pardon, which now appears infinitely needful, when <lb/>
this black and dreadful Bill is set before us. Yet lest <lb/>
all this should not be sufficient to produce that sorrow <lb/>
and shame, which is necessary for this <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>solemnConfession</sic>
                     <corr>solemn Confession</corr>
                  </choice>, <lb/>
but our hearts remain still obdurate and unrelenting, <lb/>
Let every one lay before himself these Considerations. <lb/>
First, Meditate of the nature of all these Sins of which <lb/>
thou art guilty: They are the Actions of a poor helpless <lb/>
depending Creature done against the holy Will, and <lb/>
most gentle and reasonable Commands, of that Majesty <lb/>
who could destroy thee in a Moment, and whom <lb/>
Angels and all the World besides exactly do obey. And <lb/>
besides, thou <normalised orig="maist" auto="false">may</normalised> upbraid thy self with the folly of <lb/>
Anger, the fury of Revenge, the filthiness of Lust, and <lb/>
the shame of Lying, the beastliness of Drunkenness, <lb/>
and the misery of Covetousness, the unreasonableness <lb/>
of Pride, and the vanity of seeking humane Praise, the <lb/>
<normalised orig="restlesness" auto="true">restlessness</normalised> of Ambition, and the vexation of a discontented <lb/>
mind. Consider the malignity of all Sin, and <lb/>
the baseness of every particular, and surely it will appear <lb/>
it was impudence and ingratitude, simplicity and <lb/>
madness in thee ever to commit them. Secondly, Meditate <lb/>
of the number of them; And think that if there <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="24">C 4</fw>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
be so much evil in one Sin, How deplorable is thy Case <lb/>
who <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> offended in so many kinds? Oh how often <lb/>
<normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> thou acted or designed, the greater and more notorious <lb/>
wickednesses? And for (those which we account) <lb/>
the lesser, What is wanting in the odiousness of the <lb/>
single Acts thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="supplyed" auto="true">supplied</normalised> by frequent repetitions, <lb/>
Few days nay minutes passing in thy whole life, in which <lb/>
thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="false">do</normalised> not sin in these instances. I doubt not but <lb/>
thy memory now presents a vast number to thee; but <lb/>
alas those that were never observed are far more, and <lb/>
those that are forgotten are much more numerous than <lb/>
both, Yet these are all noted in the Records of Heaven; <lb/>
So that if thou <normalised orig="couldest" auto="true">could</normalised> apprehend this formidable Army, <lb/>
it would lay thy confidence in the dust, and strike <lb/>
thee with amazement to consider how may times thou <lb/>
<normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> deserved Condemnation. Thirdly, Meditate of <lb/>
the Desert, of these Sins, viz. that <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 6.23">the wages of</quote> (any, <lb/>
the least unobserved, or forgotten) <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 6.23">sin is death</quote>, <normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>. <lb/>
6. 23. And then how many times <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> thou deserved <lb/>
to be cut off? Consider how thou art by these transgressions <lb/>
exposed to the wrath of God, and to suffer all <lb/>
those Temporal, Spiritual, and Eternal miseries, which <lb/>
the Righteous Judge of all the World <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="threatned" auto="true">threatened</normalised> <lb/>
in his holy word. And if thy heart be apt to excuse <lb/>
its faults, on pretence of a corrupt Nature, a violent <lb/>
Temptation, or a sudden <normalised orig="surprize" auto="true">surprise</normalised>, and will not believe, <lb/>
or fear that God is so highly displeased; then tell thy <lb/>
own Soul that for one offence, the Angels were cast out <lb/>
of Heaven, and Adam out of Paradise, and He that is <lb/>
the lover of Men, for lighter or fewer Crimes, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> lay <lb/>
dreadful Plagues and Miseries upon thy Brethren; And <lb/>
God is no respecter of Persons; He spared not his own <lb/>
Son, when he stood in the place of Sinners, and shall <lb/>
He spare thee? Oh look up to the Cross of Jesus, and <lb/>
behold his Agonies and his Sorrow, hear his groans and <lb/>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="cryes" auto="true">cries</normalised>, observe his anguish and his pains. Is not God <lb/>
highly displeased with Sin, when he makes his own Son <lb/>
the Example of his wrath, to his offending Servants? <lb/>
In short know, that if Repentance do not now procure <lb/>
thy Pardon, thou shalt have God and all Creatures thy <lb/>
Enemies, and <normalised orig="maist" auto="false">may</normalised> justly expect Losses and Crosses, Poverty <lb/>
and Reproach, Diseases and an evil Death; and <lb/>
(which is more horrid) to be deprived of the aids of <lb/>
Gods Spirit, and the offers of Grace, and to be left in thy <lb/>
own hardness and impenitency, as one that <normalised orig="refuseth" auto="true">refuses</normalised> to <lb/>
be reclaimed. And if any or all these have not yet <lb/>
<normalised orig="faln" auto="true">fallen</normalised> upon thee, it is only because the Lord will try whether <lb/>
at this time thou wilt seriously Repent; but thou <lb/>
are not acquitted, though he do awhile forbear. <lb/>
Fourthly, Meditate of those Aggravations which make <lb/>
thy Sins worse than those of other Men, and that will <lb/>
convince thee that thou <normalised orig="deservest" auto="true">deserve</normalised> no less. For First, <lb/>
Have not many of them been committed against thy <lb/>
knowledge, and reason; and in despite of all the checks <lb/>
and reluctancies of thy Conscience? Secondly, And <lb/>
although thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> made so many vows, and taken <lb/>
so many resolutions, never to act them more; yea and <lb/>
engaged this upon the holy Sacrament of Christs body <lb/>
and blood: Yet <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> thou not entertained them again? <lb/>
Thirdly, Have not all those mercies and favours spiritual <lb/>
and temporal, wherewith thy Heavenly Father <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
courted thy Love, been abused by thee, and cast away <lb/>
upon thee, when all this could not prevail, to make thee <lb/>
leave one lust, or <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> thee to give over piercing <lb/>
him that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> died for thee? Fourthly, <normalised orig="Hast" auto="true">Have</normalised> thou not <lb/>
proceeded in thy evil Courses, after all those Examples <lb/>
of divine vengeance on others, and all those Calamities <lb/>
which Sin <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> brought upon thy own self? <normalised orig="Hast" auto="true">Have</normalised> <lb/>
thou feared any longer than the smart remained? <normalised orig="Hast" auto="true">Have</normalised> <lb/>
thou not made the Almighty almost weary of Correcting <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="26">25</fw>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
thee? and <normalised orig="shewest" auto="true">show</normalised> thou <normalised orig="lovest" auto="true">love</normalised> thy Sin too well to <lb/>
be easily torn from it? <normalised orig="Fifthly" auto="true">Fiftly</normalised>, And finally how mischievous <lb/>
have the effects of thy transgressions been? <lb/>
They have dishonoured God, disgraced thy Religion, <lb/>
<normalised orig="incouraged" auto="true">encouraged</normalised> the wicked to persevere, incited the innocent <lb/>
to follow thy steps, and offended weak and tender <lb/>
<normalised orig="Chrisitans" auto="false">Christians</normalised>. This is indeed a sad story, and if we rightly <lb/>
apprehend it, may make the best to cry out with trembling <lb/>
and deep contrition, <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 123.3">Lord have mercy upon us</quote>! <lb/>
But lest this dismal Account which will scarce fetch one <lb/>
sigh from a stupid Soul, should overwhelm others in <lb/>
grief and desperation; I shall add, that we are not like <lb/>
the Jew, who when the Law thundered from Mount <lb/>
Eball, could only sign it with a deadful Amen, For we <lb/>
look further, and beholding the Lamb of God, make <lb/>
bold to crave mercy; the very acknowledgement of our <lb/>
Sin being <normalised orig="wrapt" auto="true">wrapped</normalised> up in a Petition of Pardon; And the <lb/>
right use of all this is, not to affright us from Jesus, but <lb/>
to drive us to him; to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> not only how little we deserve, <lb/>
but how much we need a pardon; It is to represent <lb/>
how far God can forgive, and how highly our dear <lb/>
Redeemer <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> merited, seeing so great and deserved <lb/>
vengeance is yet with-holden, and the Gate of Mercy <lb/>
still kept open for such wretched Creatures. Our design <lb/>
in this discovery of Sin is to convince us, that it <lb/>
is high time to desist from adding to this inifinite heap, <lb/>
that it is <normalised orig="extreamly" auto="true">extremely</normalised> necessary to seek for Absolution, <lb/>
and that it will be an admirable <normalised orig="ingaging" auto="true">engaging</normalised> favour, if <lb/>
we be again accepted. For Mount Sinah is the way to <lb/>
<normalised orig="Sion" auto="true">Zion</normalised>, and the Law our School-master to bring us to <lb/>
Christ. When therefore your heart is full of these <lb/>
thoughts, and when hope and fear, sorrow and desire, <lb/>
are <normalised orig="strugling" auto="true">struggling</normalised> within you, In the midst of these Passions, <lb/>
bend your knees and begin to arraign your self at the <lb/>
Bar of your merciful Judge, where humble Confession <lb/>
                  <pb n="16"/>
                  <lb/>
is the readiest way to Remission. <lb/>
Acknowledge therefore all you <lb/>
have found, relate your shame and <lb/>
indignation at your self, your <lb/>
grief and anguish for all your misdoings, <lb/>
<normalised orig="intreat" auto="true">entreat</normalised> as for your life, and with all earnestness <lb/>
beg for pity and pardon; <normalised orig="remembring" auto="true">remembering</normalised> he never did <lb/>
cast off any that thus came to him. Your Confession <lb/>
it self will be no other than a larger Paraphrase, of <lb/>
Lord have mercy, &amp;c. But if you require a form, the <lb/>
Church <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> made excellent provision in that acknowledgment <lb/>
before the Consecration, to <lb/>
which the Reader is desired to <lb/>
turn, and while his heart is in this <lb/>
frame, with great Devotion to recite that Form. <lb/>
8. But that this is not all the use of these Ten <lb/>
Commandments, we may learn, from the other part of <lb/>
the Versicle repeated after each of them, which is Davids <lb/>
Prayer, <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 119. 36. viz. And incline our hearts <lb/>
to keep this Law. Which minds us of the next part <lb/>
of our Preparation for the Holy Sacrament to which <lb/>
the Law is apt to minister, viz. Secondly, The Renewing <lb/>
of our Covenant, and this will necessarily follow <lb/>
our Confession if it be sincere and the language of <lb/>
a contrite heart. Since we now have discovered the <lb/>
vileness and danger of our sinful courses, We must needs <lb/>
be full of indignation against those ways, and cannot <lb/>
but wish we may never fall into the like circumstances <lb/>
again. Nay God may expect that those who are so <lb/>
drenched in tears, and amazed with fear, shall now <lb/>
study how they may keep the right paths of his Law <lb/>
hereafter. And this was the principal end why you <lb/>
were put upon considering your ways, that you might <lb/>
turn your feet to his Testimonies, <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 119. 59. And if <lb/>
you be now desirous to do this, it is the best sign of <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="28">27</fw>
                  <pb n="17"/>
                  <lb/>
your Repentance, the surest evidence of your pardon, <lb/>
and the best <normalised orig="dispostion" auto="false">disposition</normalised> in the World for your reception <lb/>
of these Mysteries; wherein it is Gods part to seal your <lb/>
Absolution by the blood of his dear Son, and yours to <lb/>
give up your self entirely to his Service for ever hereafter, <lb/>
since he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> so graciously quitted the old scores. <lb/>
So that there is no doubt but the true Penitent <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> now <lb/>
desire with all his Soul to forsake his Sins and do his <lb/>
duty better. Only because he finds his heart averse, and <lb/>
not easily inclined to this which (his Conscience tell <lb/>
him) is his interest and his happiness; The Church <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
added this short but significant Petition, to him that <lb/>
can turn the heart, and work in us both to will and to do, <lb/>
That he would <normalised orig="Encline" auto="true">Incline</normalised>, &amp;c. Which Prayer that it may <lb/>
be said with Davids Spirit, We <lb/>
must resolve to follow those good <lb/>
inclinations when it <normalised orig="pleaseth" auto="true">pleases</normalised> God <lb/>
to work them in us. And to that <lb/>
purpose, before we make this our <lb/>
solemn promise, we must labour <lb/>
to bring our hearts to condemn the <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> of Sin, and <lb/>
to approve of the ways of Holiness, lest we should <lb/>
mock the Almighty, by begging his help in that which <lb/>
we never intend to perform; and lest our vow should <lb/>
vanish into Air, if we do not first consider the particulars <lb/>
to which we bind our selves. And for our assistance <lb/>
herein, viz. that our Engagement may be advised and <lb/>
well grounded, and our Prayers for the divine Aid <lb/>
may be hearty and sincere; We may after our Confession <lb/>
(while our hearts are yet bleeding for our former offences) <lb/>
enlarge our thoughts into these or the like Meditations. <lb/>
9. First to alientate our affections from Sin, that <lb/>
we may in earnest and for ever renounce it, Let every <lb/>
one of us ask his Soul these Questions. <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="29">28</fw>
                  <pb n="18"/>
                  <lb/>
First, How little of either true profit or solid pleasure <lb/>
have I reaped from Sin? The gain is cursed and <lb/>
<normalised orig="intangled" auto="true">entangled</normalised>, the delight short, and unsatisfying, ending <lb/>
either in vexation or a restless desire, which stays longer <lb/>
and wounds deeper than ever the <normalised orig="fantastick" auto="true">fantastic</normalised> pleasure <lb/>
reached. How certain is it, that none of these purchases <lb/>
can last <normalised orig="beyong" auto="false">beyond</normalised> the short duration of my frail life? <lb/>
and how little security have I that my death shall not <lb/>
be ere the next Morning? Secondly, How great a <lb/>
trouble yet have I had all my life for this trifling and uncertain <lb/>
reward? the gain was a shadow, but have I not <lb/>
thereby lost my good name, or my health, my time, and <lb/>
my parts, the love of my best friends, and the hopes of <lb/>
Gods favour? Have not these Sins hindered my Prayers, <lb/>
disquieted my Conscience, set my Neighbours <lb/>
against me, and filled my ways with losses, crosses, mischiefs <lb/>
and evil <normalised orig="Accidends" auto="false">Accidents</normalised>? Have they not often made <lb/>
me ridiculous and base, hated and distrusted, and left <lb/>
me full of fears and sad expectations, making my life <lb/>
<normalised orig="uneasie" auto="true">uneasy</normalised>, and my death far more bitter and more terrible? <lb/>
Thirdly, But these are but the beginnings of sorrow; <lb/>
For is it not as sure as God is true, that if I persist in <lb/>
them, I shall lose all my interest in my only Saviour? <lb/>
forfeit all my hopes of Heaven? and sell my title to <lb/>
the glorious Kingdom which is full of ravishing and <lb/>
endless, pleasures, and all abundance of whatsoever heart <lb/>
can wish? And besides this insupportable loss, shall not <lb/>
my Soul be condemned in the last dreadful judgment, <lb/>
and cast into the Region of horror and darkness, anguish <lb/>
and torments that have no abatement, nor no <lb/>
end? Why then, Oh my Soul wilt thou buy these vanities <lb/>
so dear? and be so abused by thy Enemies, so ungrateful <lb/>
to thy dying Redeemer, and so mischievous <lb/>
and cruel to thy self? Wilt thou ever be so foolish and <lb/>
so desperate to commit the like again? Saya then, O my <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="30">29</fw>
                  <pb n="19"/>
                  <lb/>
Soul, I abhor and renounce these accursed delusions, <lb/>
being almost enraged at my self that I have been <lb/>
cheated with them so long; My reason is convinced, <lb/>
and my will <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised>, that thy ways are the Right: <lb/>
Therefore, O Lord <normalised orig="encline" auto="true">incline</normalised>, &amp;c. <lb/>
10. Secondly, To engage our minds to all the <lb/>
Duties of Religion and Piety, Justice, and Charity, that <lb/>
we may unalterable <normalised orig="chuse" auto="true">choose</normalised> them, Let every one of us <lb/>
meditate, <lb/>
First, Why should I be backward to vow my obedience <lb/>
to the Laws of God? Are they any thing else but <lb/>
a method of living well and wisely, free from fears <lb/>
and injury? Do they not teach me to bear my self so <lb/>
that I may win the favour of God and good men, and <lb/>
be safe in the best, and happy in the worst condition? <lb/>
Can I <normalised orig="wsih" auto="false">wish</normalised> my dearest Friend, or my own Soul, a greater <lb/>
felicity than to be meek and patient, grateful and contented, <lb/>
temperate and industrious, just and bountiful, to <lb/>
converse with God, rejoice with Angels, to imitate the <lb/>
Saints, follow the blessed Jesus, and to seek Everlasting <lb/>
Joy? Secondly, <normalised orig="Doth" auto="true">Does</normalised> God require any thing impossible, <lb/>
unjust or unreasonable? Am I to bind my self to <lb/>
any more than that which my Judgment and my Conscience <lb/>
(when I am serious) tell me it is fit and expedient <lb/>
for me to do, although it had never been commanded? <lb/>
Is it any more than that which all the wisest <lb/>
and best men, the friends of God and the Darlings <lb/>
of Heaven have done with the greatest delight and <lb/>
pleasure? and therefore it is the only proof of a generous <lb/>
and noble Spirit. Thirdly, Is not my God the <lb/>
best of all Masters? who covers the infirmities, and <lb/>
<normalised orig="strenghtens" auto="false">strengths</normalised> the weaknesses of his Servants? Can I fail <lb/>
to please him who begets the desire and enables for the <lb/>
performance? and makes the way familiar and <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised>, <lb/>
pleasant and inviting, and yet where there is a hearty <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="31">30</fw>
                  <pb n="20"/>
                  <lb/>
endeavour <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> make many abatements, and accept the <lb/>
will for the deed, and who begins <lb/>
his assistances early, and continues <lb/>
them till he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> perfected <lb/>
this excellent work? Fourthly, Finally <lb/>
shall I not be rewarded with a glorious Crown in <lb/>
Heaven, for being so wise as to <normalised orig="chuse" auto="true">choose</normalised> to be happy on <lb/>
Earth? Is not this the sure way to the enjoyment of <lb/>
God, the Society of Jesus, and the <normalised orig="Felloship" auto="true">Fellowship</normalised> of glorified <lb/>
Saints and blessed Souls? to Eternal Peace, never-ceasing <lb/>
Joy, to the most perfect and <normalised orig="compleat" auto="true">complete</normalised> felicity <lb/>
which shall last for ever, though the <normalised orig="troule" auto="false">trouble</normalised> of gaining <lb/>
it be but short, and transitory? Be wise therefore Oh <lb/>
my Soul! and easily <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> to <normalised orig="chuse" auto="true">choose</normalised> thine own happiness; <lb/>
And say, I desire and long to be acquainted <lb/>
with these paths of pleasantness, I <normalised orig="chuse" auto="true">choose</normalised> and love them <lb/>
all. O Lord <normalised orig="encline" auto="true">incline</normalised> our hearts to keep these Laws. And <lb/>
now I hope it may be time to bend your knees again, <lb/>
and with a fresh bewailing of your transgressions, and <lb/>
many <normalised orig="acknowledgments" auto="false">acknowledgements</normalised> of your Conviction, to renounce <lb/>
and protest against all iniquity; especially, that <lb/>
by which you have been most apt to fall; and also to <lb/>
vow and engage, that you will lead a holy life; which <lb/>
you must do most seriously as in the presence of God; <lb/>
And finally looking unto Jesus the purchaser of Pardon, <lb/>
and giver of all Grace, most humbly beg the holy <lb/>
Spirit, that you may be enabled to keep this pious resolution, <lb/>
since it is your wisdom and happiness never to <lb/>
break it more; to which purpose say, Lord write all <lb/>
these thy Laws in our hearts we beseech thee. That is, in <lb/>
our memories and our affections, that we might not <lb/>
offend against them. <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 119. 11. For if his Spirit <lb/>
<normalised orig="ingrave" auto="true">engrave</normalised> them on our Souls, we shall with ease and pleasure <lb/>
keep and do them. Ezek. 36. 26. Wherefore let <lb/>
us beg this favour most earnestly, and let us not doubt of <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="32">31</fw>
                  <pb n="21"/>
                  <lb/>
being heard. For this is the first and greatest part of <lb/>
the new Covenant; God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="ingaged" auto="true">engaged</normalised>, He will put his <lb/>
laws in our minds, and on our hearts will he write them, <lb/>
Jerem. 31. 33. Heb. 8. 10. And further, if we so sincerely <lb/>
pray for his grace of Obedience, it will <normalised orig="ingage" auto="true">engage</normalised> our <lb/>
Heavenly Father still more effectually to grant the last <lb/>
clause, viz. that our Sins and iniquities he will remember <lb/>
no more. <lb/>
