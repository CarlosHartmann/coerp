               <head>They deny the Sacrament of <normalised orig="Baptisme" auto="true">Baptism</normalised><lb/>
to Infants.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
THe ground of this <normalised orig="Errour" auto="true">Error</normalised> is ignorance, they not knowing<lb/>
what <normalised orig="Baptisme" auto="true">Baptism</normalised> is, pretending faith and repentance to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised><lb/>
the essence of <normalised orig="Baptisme" auto="true">Baptism</normalised>, which Infants are not capable of, and<lb/>
therefore not to be <normalised orig="baptized" auto="true">baptised</normalised>.<lb/>
To this I answer; As faith and repentance was not the essence<lb/>
of Circumcision, but the outward circumcising of the flesh, and<lb/>
the inward circumcising of the heart.<lb/>
So the essence of <normalised orig="Baptisme" auto="true">Baptism</normalised>, is not faith and repentance, but the<lb/>
outward washing of the water, the word annexed, &amp; the inward<lb/>
washing of the spirit.<lb/>
Our Lord <normalised orig="affirmeth" auto="true">affirms</normalised> <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> the 3. <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 3.5">Except a man be born <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised><lb/>
by water and the holy Ghost,</quote> &amp;c. St. Augustine <normalised orig="affirmeth" auto="true">affirms</normalised>, although<lb/>
sound faith be not present: yet the Sacrament of <normalised orig="baptisme" auto="true">baptism</normalised><lb/>
may be sound. The Greek Patriarch, writing to the German<lb/>
Divines, <normalised orig="affirmeth" auto="true">affirms</normalised> in <normalised orig="baptisme" auto="true">baptism</normalised> the matter to be water, the <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised><lb/>
the words, videl. This servant of God is <normalised orig="baptized" auto="true">baptised</normalised> in the name of<lb/>
the Father, Son, and holy Ghost: the <normalised orig="instrumentall" auto="true">instrumental</normalised> cause to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised><lb/>
the Minister.<lb/>
The Anabaptists attribute too much in this Sacrament to their<lb/>
repentance, faith, mortification and merit, and little or nothing<lb/>
to Gods mercy which is most contrary to the nature of this holy<lb/>
Sacrament, which <normalised orig="sealeth" auto="true">seals</normalised> up unto us our receiving into Gods favour<lb/>
and grace for his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> mercies sake without any merit of<lb/>
ours.<lb/>
To palliate this their <normalised orig="abhominable" auto="true">abominable</normalised> error, they pervert divers<lb/>
places of holy Scripture, as Math. 28. Mar. 10. Out of the<lb/>
order of words; <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 28.19"><normalised orig="Goe" auto="true">Go</normalised> and teach all Nations, <normalised orig="baptizing" auto="true">baptising</normalised> them:</quote>
                  <lb/>
Because that teaching is set before <normalised orig="baptizing" auto="true">baptising</normalised>, they would have<lb/>
children taught before they are <normalised orig="baptized" auto="true">baptised</normalised>.<lb/>
To this I answer, 1. Wheareas teaching is set before <normalised orig="baptizing" auto="true">baptising</normalised>,<lb/>
Math. 28. <normalised orig="Baptizing" auto="true">Baptising</normalised> is set before teaching, Mar. 1.4.<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Mk 1.4">John did <choice ana="print-error">
                        <sic>baptizo</sic>
                        <corr><normalised orig="baptize" auto="true">baptise</normalised></corr>
                     </choice> in the <normalised orig="wildernesse" auto="true">wilderness</normalised>, and teach the <normalised orig="baptisme" auto="true">baptism</normalised> of<lb/>
repentance:</quote> And <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> where it is said, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mk 1.15">repent and <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised></quote>?<lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
whether is faith or repentance first required?<lb/>
But where <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> you (say they) a <normalised orig="literall" auto="true">literal</normalised> command in all the<lb/>
new Testament for the <normalised orig="baptisme" auto="true">baptism</normalised> of Infants?<lb/>
To this I answer? The new Testament <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not literally command.<lb/>
Remember to keep holy the Lords day, nor to say grace<lb/>
before and after <normalised orig="meales" auto="true">meals</normalised>, or to pray with our families evening<lb/>
and morning, or for women to receive the Communion, and<lb/>
many other such like things, which are <normalised orig="morall" auto="true">moral</normalised> duties, and may<lb/>
be sufficiently proved by consequence out of the holy Scriptures.<lb/>
As for example in this very Text which they <normalised orig="alleadg" auto="false">allege</normalised> against the<lb/>
<normalised orig="baptisme" auto="true">baptism</normalised> of children: the <normalised orig="baptisme" auto="true">baptism</normalised> of children is there commanded:<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 28.19"><normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> and teach all nations, <normalised orig="baptizing" auto="true">baptising</normalised>,</quote> &amp;c., The meaning<lb/>
is, <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> and teach all them that are capable of teaching, and<lb/>
<normalised orig="baptize" auto="true">baptise</normalised> them that are capable of <normalised orig="baptizing" auto="true">baptising</normalised>: To make this more<lb/>
<normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised>.<lb/>
If a man should bid his servant <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> <normalised orig="sheare" auto="true">shear</normalised> all my <normalised orig="sheepe" auto="true">sheep</normalised> and<lb/>
mark them: if that servant should <normalised orig="shere" auto="false">shear</normalised> all his sheep, and <normalised orig="marke" auto="true">mark</normalised><lb/>
them only that he had <normalised orig="shorne" auto="true">shorn</normalised>, and not <normalised orig="marke" auto="true">mark</normalised> his Lambs because<lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> could not <normalised orig="shere" auto="false">shear</normalised> them: <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> that servant <normalised orig="fulfill" auto="true">fulfil</normalised> his Masters<lb/>
command? No more had the Apostles done, if they had not<lb/>
marked his lambs as well as his sheep, although they were not<lb/>
capable of teaching, yet they were capable of marking or <normalised orig="baptizing" auto="true">baptising</normalised>.<lb/>
In <normalised orig="lawes" auto="true">laws</normalised> and precepts that be <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised>, the numeration of<lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>sing*lars</sic>
                     <corr>singulars</corr>
                  </choice> are not necessary, because <normalised orig="lawes" auto="true">laws</normalised> <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> command the<lb/>
whole kind: and therefore the holy Apostles <normalised orig="baptized" auto="true">baptised</normalised> whole<lb/>
<normalised orig="Familes" auto="true">Families</normalised>, in which we find none excepted, as St. Peter <normalised orig="baptized" auto="true">baptised</normalised><lb/>
Cornelius and his <normalised orig="Familie" auto="true">Family</normalised>, Acts 10. 48. St. Paul <normalised orig="baptized" auto="true">baptised</normalised> the<lb/>

<normalised orig="cruell" auto="true">cruel</normalised> sentence to set all Infants in no better state then Pagans<lb/>
and Infidels, without Christ, Aliens from the Common-wealth<lb/>

Let these men also consider how much they provoke<lb/>

That it is <normalised orig="unlawfull" auto="true">unlawful</normalised> for a Christian man to be a Magistrate<lb/>
or to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> subject to a Magistrate. And why? They object<lb/>
that subjection came in with sin, but Christ <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> taken away<lb/>
sin, and therefore no subjection. To this I answer, Subjection<lb/>
is twofold, servile or <normalised orig="civill" auto="true">civil</normalised>; servile is the vassalage of a slave,<lb/>
which was not before the fall; <normalised orig="Civill" auto="true">Civil</normalised> for the common good was<lb/>
before: the former a curse, the latter a blessing: Eve was subject<lb/>
to Adam before either of them sinned. 2. They object that<lb/>
every <normalised orig="beleever" auto="true">believer</normalised> is now in the <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> of Heaven, Christ alone<lb/>
must <normalised orig="reigne" auto="true">reign</normalised>. <normalised orig="Ans" auto="true">And</normalised>. There is a <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> standing in<lb/>
grace, peace and joy, in which there is no distinction of persons.<lb/>
There is also a <normalised orig="civill" auto="true">civil</normalised> Government, which cannot subsist without<lb/>
distinctions and order; there must be Masters and servants, subjects<lb/>
and <normalised orig="Governours" auto="true">Governors</normalised>, and necessity <normalised orig="requireth" auto="true">requires</normalised> it, it is the bond<lb/>
of the Common-wealth. There is a Regiment in the Host of<lb/>

                  <lb/>

Beast. St. Paul <normalised orig="calleth" auto="true">calls</normalised> Magistracy a divine ordinance; all<lb/>
Gods ordinances are good and <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised>: in the 82 <normalised orig="Psalme" auto="true">Psalm</normalised><lb/>
Princes are called Gods because they are in Gods place. The<lb/>
Anabaptists themselves who despised Government, finding the<lb/>
necessity of it in Munster, so that they could not subsist without<lb/>
Government, chose themselves a King with <normalised orig="inferiour" auto="true">inferior</normalised> Officers<lb/>
under him.<lb/>
That it is not <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised> for a Magistrate to punish because revenge<lb/>
is forbidden christian men.<lb/>
In this they <normalised orig="erre" auto="true">err</normalised>, not distinguishing <normalised orig="betweene" auto="true">between</normalised> revenge and<lb/>
punishment which is from the Magistrate by reason of the execution<lb/>
of the Law grounded upon Gods Law, a <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised> punishment<lb/>
appointed by God. The Magistrate, saith St. Paul,<lb/>
is the Minister of God appointed for thy good; either for our<lb/>

That a Christian man may not take an oath, because Christ<lb/>

And that it is enough to say, yea, yea, and nay, nay.<lb/>
Answ. Christ <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not forbid an oath before a Magistrate as<lb/>
it is a testimony of truth: <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="reproveth" auto="true">reproves</normalised> the Pharisees who<lb/>

God as God had commanded, but also by heaven, by the earth,<lb/>

the authority of holy Scripture; <quote type="biblical" ana="Deut 6.13">By the name of God thou shalt<lb/>
<normalised orig="sweare" auto="true">swear</normalised>,</quote> Deut. 6.4. The reason is set <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> Heb. 6. Because<lb/>

men in the old and new Testament, Gen. 24. 26. 3. From<lb/>
the worship of God: for an oath is part of Gods worship, being<lb/>
a calling upon God to be a <normalised orig="witnesse" auto="true">witness</normalised> of the truth, and an avenger<lb/>

This opinion <normalised orig="openeth" auto="true">opens</normalised> a gap to all Treasons, Rebellions, and<lb/>

Christian man to keep such an oath. Isaac made a covenant with<lb/>
Abimelech King of Gerar, to do one another no hurt: which,<lb/>
being sealed up with an oath, could not be violated without sinning<lb/>
against God. The Prophet Ezekiel called the oath of obedience<lb/>
(which Zedechiah King of Israel made to the King of Babel)<lb/>
The oath of God: although the said King was a tyrant and<lb/>
an usurper without any <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised> succession from David, yet<lb/>
God saith by the mouth of his Prophet Ezek. 17.19. <quote type="biblical" ana="Ezek 17.19">As I<lb/>
                     <pb n="12"/>
                     <lb/>

Again you may see how great a tie an oath is; &amp; how severely<lb/>

the Gibeonites, Iosh. 9. Ioshuah and the Princes having made a<lb/>

the Princes, were answered by them after this manner; we have<lb/>
sworn to them by the Lord God of Israel, now therefore wee may<lb/>
not touch them, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which<lb/>
we swore unto them. About 400. <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> after, Saul in his <normalised orig="zeale" auto="true">zeal</normalised><lb/>
to the children of Israel, slew the Gibeonites, for which cause<lb/>
2 Sam. 21. The Lord plagued the whole Land, sending a famine<lb/>
upon them for 3 <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>, declaring <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, that it was sent<lb/>
because Saul had <normalised orig="slaine" auto="true">slain</normalised> the Gibeonites: who hanged up seven<lb/>
of Sauls sons given them by David, and then God was entreated<lb/>
