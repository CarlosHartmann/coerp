XCVII. BUt to make it manifestly appear, that<lb/>
in the Ages following there was no Obligation<lb/>
put upon any Man, to observe<lb/>
either the pretended Decrees of Innocent, and Gelasius,<lb/>
or the Canon of the African <normalised orig="Councel" auto="true">Council</normalised>, and the Catalogue<lb/>
of S. Austin, (at least not in that strict sense and acception,<lb/>
wherein they are all now produced by our<lb/>
Opposites, and urged against us,) but that the Church<lb/>
continued still to observe the Ancient Canon of Scripture,<lb/>
which the Christians had received from the Jews,<lb/>
and which both S. <normalised orig="Hierome" auto="true">Jerome</normalised> and Ruffin, and the other<lb/>
Old Writers before them, had accurately delineated;<lb/>
we shall for this purpose take a view of the Subsequent<lb/>
times, and the Testimonies of <normalised orig="thos" auto="true">those</normalised> Ecclesiastical Authors<lb/>
that lived in them, and left any Record of this matter<lb/>
behind them, every one in their Order.<lb/>
XCVIII. We have already seen that Four Patriarchal<lb/>
Churches have declared themselves for us.<lb/>
1. For the Church of <normalised orig="Ierusalem" auto="true">Jerusalem</normalised> furnished us with S.<lb/>
Cyrill. 2. The Church of Alexandria with S. Athanasius.<lb/>
3. The Church of Antioch with Anastasius.<lb/>
4. And the Church of Constantinople with S. <normalised orig="Gregorie" auto="true">Gregory</normalised><lb/>
Nazianzen, besides many Others that depended upon<lb/>
those several Seas. And if any credit may be given<lb/>
to the writings of Clemens, the Church of Rome also<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> furnished us with the first Patriarch and Bishop<lb/>
she had. But whether his Testimony be received or<lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
no, we are more assured that S. GREGORY the<lb/>
GREAT, who was another Bishop of that Patriarchal<lb/>
Sea, will give in his Witness and Suffrage for us.<lb/>
XCIX. S. GREGORY then (as divers of the late<lb/>
Roman Writers do <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised>,) <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> herein declared<lb/>
himself to follow the Canon of the Ancient Church<lb/>
set forth by S. <normalised orig="Hierome" auto="true">Jerome</normalised> and the Fathers before him;<lb/>
when in his Morals being about to <normalised orig="alledge" auto="true">allege</normalised> a passage<lb/>
in the Book of the Maccabes, he first <normalised orig="maketh" auto="true">makes</normalised> an Excuse<lb/>
for it, and saith, "That though it be not produced<lb/>
out of the CANONICAL BOOKS of Scripture"<lb/>
yet <normalised orig="alledged" auto="true">alleged</normalised> it is out of such a Book, as was<lb/>
<normalised orig="publish'd" auto="true">published</normalised> for the Edification of the Church. By which<lb/>
words he <normalised orig="acknowledgeth" auto="true">acknowledges</normalised>, that Some Books, of the Bible<lb/>
there are, which be not Canonical, and that the Books<lb/>
of the Maccabes are of that Number. And what can<lb/>
any Man desire to be said more <normalised orig="expresly" auto="true">expressly</normalised>?<lb/>
C. Yet because there are Two Pretences made; One,<lb/>
that elsewhere he <normalised orig="Canonizeth" auto="true">Canonises</normalised> all the rest of the Contested<lb/>
Books; and another, that in this place he <normalised orig="detracteth" auto="false">detracted</normalised><lb/>
nothing in that behalf from the Books of the Maccabes,<lb/>
we will clear the way before us, and answer<lb/>
them both. 1. And First, for all the other Books,<lb/>
Gretser the Jesuite, (that <normalised orig="contendeth" auto="true">contends</normalised> for them,) will<lb/>
be our witness, "(That S. <normalised orig="Gregorie" auto="true">Gregory</normalised> in all his<lb/>
Works, <normalised orig="maketh" auto="true">makes</normalised> not any mention of the Book or<lb/>
History of Judith." And if otherwhiles he <normalised orig="nameth" auto="false">named</normalised><lb/>
Tobit, it is but very <normalised orig="Seldome" auto="true">Seldom</normalised> that he <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> so, and<lb/>
most an end, under the Name of A certain Sage<lb/>
person, or a certain Holy Man, without any peculiar<lb/>
appellation, or citing of his Book; as likewise under<lb/>
the same <normalised orig="termes" auto="true">terms</normalised> he often <normalised orig="alledgeth" auto="true">alleges</normalised> the sayings of the<lb/>
Books of Wisdom, and Ecclesiasticus; which are<lb/>
so far from being <normalised orig="Termes" auto="true">Terms</normalised> proper to the Canonical<lb/>
Writers of Gods Divine Scriptures, that many of the<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="137">136</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
Fathers both Greek and Latin give them not<lb/>
only to divers Christian Authors, but to the Philosophers<lb/>
themselves. And what if at some other time he <normalised orig="maketh" auto="true">makes</normalised><lb/>
a more honourable mention both of Ecclesiasticus<lb/>
and the Wisdom of <normalised orig="Salomon" auto="true">Solomon</normalised>, attributing to them<lb/>
the title of holy Writings? yet this <normalised orig="lodgeth" auto="true">lodges</normalised> not<lb/>
those Books higher then in the Second Rank of Scriptures,<lb/>
that be of a lesser, imperfect, and <normalised orig="doubtfull" auto="true">doubtful</normalised><lb/>
                  <choice ana="typeset-error">

                     <corr>Authority</corr>
                  </choice>, as Iunilius Africanus said of them before;<lb/>
or as S. Gregory saith here himself in the<lb/>
place which we first <normalised orig="alledged" auto="true">alleged</normalised>, that be not Canonical,<lb/>
but written only by wise and good men for the<lb/>
Edification of the Church. But Coccius built his wall<lb/>
with untempered Mortar, when he set up S.<lb/>
Gregory to cite the Book of Sirach under the Name<lb/>
and Authority of <normalised orig="Salomon" auto="true">Solomon</normalised> himself, <normalised orig="alledging" auto="true">alleging</normalised> for this<lb/>
purpose his First Sermon upon Ezechiel, and pretending<lb/>
that these words (<quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 3.11">My Son, despise not thou the<lb/>
Chastening of the Lord, neither be thou weary of his Correction,</quote>)<lb/>
are to be found there quoted out of the<lb/>
VII<hi rend="high">th</hi>. Chapter of Ecclesiasticus; For neither is this<lb/>
Sentence in Ecclesiasticus, (being a verse taken out of<lb/>
the Proverbs,) nor is it to be seen in all S. Gregories<lb/>
Sermon upon Ezechiel; who in his <normalised orig="Proeme" auto="true">Proem</normalised><lb/>
upon the Canticles <normalised orig="acknowledgeth" auto="true">acknowledges</normalised> <normalised orig="Salomon" auto="true">Solomon</normalised> to be the<lb/>
Author of no Other Books but those Three which we<lb/>
properly receive for his, and number among the true<lb/>
Canonical Scriptures. 2. For eluding the Authority,<lb/>
or Testimony, produced out of S. Gregory against the<lb/>
Canonizing of the Maccabes, Monsieur du Perron, or<lb/>
those that <normalised orig="magnifie" auto="true">magnify</normalised> his Reply to K. James most, may<lb/>
not think to <choice ana="print">

                     <corr>carry</corr>
                  </choice> it away from us, by saying, That<lb/>
S. Gregory, when he began first to write his Morals<lb/>
upon Job, was but yet a <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>simp*e</sic>
                     <corr>simple</corr>
                  </choice> Deacon, and not Bishop<lb/>
or Pope of Rome, being at that time <normalised orig="imploy'd" auto="true">employed</normalised> as Nuncio<lb/>
at Constantinople among the Greeks. For first, if the<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="138">T</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
Maccabes and the like Books had been held and believed<lb/>
to be Canonical Scriptures at Rome, (as Cardinal<lb/>
Perron supposed here they were, both at Rome, and<lb/>
all the Western Church over,) it is no way probable,<lb/>
that S. Gregory, who had all his life time before been<lb/>
brought up, and instructed in that Church, would<lb/>
have <normalised orig="chang'd" auto="true">changed</normalised> his belief so lightly as soon as he came<lb/>
into the Eastern Church among the Greeks at Constantinople;<lb/>
which had been at least a dissembling in<lb/>
him, and no upright walking according to truth. But he<lb/>
that durst there oppose Eupsychius the <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>Pa*riarch</sic>
                     <corr>Patriarch</corr>
                  </choice>,<lb/>
and defend another Point of true Belief against him,<lb/>
would never (sure) have <normalised orig="suppress'd" auto="true">suppressed</normalised> or dissembled<lb/>
this at Constantinople, if he had known it to be an<lb/>
Article or a Principle of their Faith at Rome; where<lb/>
we may therefore safely conclude, that no such Article<lb/>
was at that time believed. Nor will it serve the Cardinals<lb/>
turn here to say, "That S. Gregory was but a<lb/>
Simple Deacon when he began first to write these<lb/>
his Morals in the East"; for he finished that Book<lb/>
in the West, and it was <normalised orig="publish'd" auto="true">published</normalised>, and sent by him afterwards,<lb/>
even then when he was Pope of Rome, to Leander<lb/>
the Bishop of <normalised orig="Siville" auto="false">Seville</normalised>; at what time, if there had<lb/>
been any such Error in it at the beginning, he might<lb/>
have mended it at the last. But he put it forth at<lb/>
Rome, as he had wrote it at Constantinople; which is<lb/>
an evident Argument, that herein the Western Church<lb/>
differed not from the East. As little is it to the purpose,<lb/>
when the same Cardinal would evade this Testimony<lb/>
of S. <normalised orig="Gregorie" auto="true">Gregory</normalised>, by pretending, "That he<lb/>
<normalised orig="spake" auto="true">spoke</normalised> not here according to his own <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>, but by<lb/>
way of a Case put <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, and not granted; so that<lb/>
the sense should be, Though the Books of the Maccabes,<lb/>
and the rest of that <normalised orig="Classe" auto="true">Class</normalised>, be not Canonical (as indeed<lb/>
they are), yet were they written for the edification of the<lb/>
Church." Which is a fine device of the Cardinal, if<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
he could by this artificial Interpretation of his own,<lb/>
defeat us of S. Gregories Suffrage. But that S. Gregory<lb/>
wrote his own judgement herein, and put not the<lb/>
matter as a Case supposed only (otherwise then he believed<lb/>
himself,) is too <normalised orig="cleer" auto="true">clear</normalised> to be so contested by<lb/>
Monsieur du Perron, or any other that are of his party.<lb/>
For else, why should S. Gregory make any Excuse,<lb/>
for citing these Books of the Maccabes? And why<lb/>
did he not in all the rest of his Works so much as bring<lb/>
any one Sentence out of those Books? as we cannot<lb/>
<normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> he did, even then, when (they say) he was making<lb/>
his (pretended) Dialogues, and building his Purgatory.<lb/>
And therefore not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> Ockam, (who<lb/>
<normalised orig="maintaineth" auto="true">maintains</normalised> our Cause, as we shall see hereafter,)<lb/>
but Catharin, and Canus themselves (who are against<lb/>
it,) do all interpret S. Gregories words in the<lb/>
same sense that we do, and say, that he followed<lb/>
S. <normalised orig="Hierome" auto="true">Jerome</normalised>, and other Fathers herein, both for the<lb/>
Maccabes, and the rest of that Rank. We conclude<lb/>
therefore; If it were lawful for S. Gregory to say, that<lb/>
those Books were not Canonical, it is as lawful for us to<lb/>
say it. And if he that was Bishop and Pope of Rome<lb/>
(to whom they attribute now more authority then<lb/>
ever he took to himself) might, and did, after the<lb/>
times of Innocent, Gelasius, and S. Austin, and the <normalised orig="Councel" auto="true">Council</normalised><lb/>
of Carthage, deny the pretended Canonization of<lb/>
these Writings, why is it now <normalised orig="maintain'd" auto="true">maintained</normalised> by our Opposites,<lb/>
that the Church had then determined the contrary?<lb/>
or why do they go about to <normalised orig="binde" auto="true">bind</normalised> us, (upon<lb/>
pain of being cursed by them, and excluded from all<lb/>
hope of Salvation,) to receive such definitions for the<lb/>
Articles of our Faith, which in S. Gregories time were<lb/>
not yet received for the common Opinions of Men?<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="140">T2</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
CI. Among the Works of S. Austin there are THREE<lb/>
BOOKS <normalised orig="intitled" auto="true">entitled</normalised>, THE WONDERS of the SCRIPTURE,<lb/>
which though they be none of His, yet<lb/>
they seem to have been written about this time. In<lb/>
the two former Books are reckoned up The Wonders<lb/>
of the Old Testament, and in the Third those of the<lb/>
New. The second of them so <normalised orig="concludeth" auto="true">concludes</normalised>, that the<lb/>
"Books of the Maccabes, though <normalised orig="containg" auto="false">containing</normalised> divers wonders,<lb/>
are never the <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> excluded out of the Divine<lb/>
Canon of Scripture."<lb/>
CII. In this Age likewise are extant The Sermons<lb/>
of ANTIOCHUS, whom Sixtus of Sienna <normalised orig="setteth" auto="true">sets</normalised><lb/>
forth to be a very well learned Man in the Scriptures.<lb/>
He was a Greek Doctor, and lived, at the time when<lb/>
Heraclius was <normalised orig="Emperour" auto="true">Emperor</normalised>, in the great <normalised orig="Colledge" auto="true">College</normalised> of<lb/>
S. Sabas, but his Sermons (highly commended for<lb/>
their worth) are given us in Latin, by Dr. Godfrey Tilman<lb/>
a Carthusian. Where in his Prologue discoursing<lb/>
parabolically upon the words of <normalised orig="Salomon" auto="true">Solomon</normalised>, he<lb/>
"<normalised orig="compareth" auto="true">compares</normalised> his LX Queens to the number of those<lb/>
Books, which, we hold to be of Eminent Authority in<lb/>
the Old and New Testament." And though we are<lb/>
here advertised by Tilman not to regard the number<lb/>
"of the Books (whereof he <normalised orig="supposeth" auto="true">supposes</normalised> there be not so<lb/>
many as LX in the Bible) but the Dignity and Authority<lb/>
of them only above others." Yet if we calculate<lb/>
the Canonical Books of both the Testaments (as Antiochus<lb/>
and some other of the Greeks did) we shall exactly<lb/>
<normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> the number of LX. For setting apart the number<lb/>
of XXVII belonging to the New Testament, The 5.<lb/>
Five Books of Moses, 6. Jos. 7. Judges and Ruth, 8. Sam.<lb/>
9. Kings, 10. Chron. 11. Ezra and Nehem. 12. Esther,<lb/>
13. Job, 14. The <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic><normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>*er</sic>
                     <corr>Psalter</corr>
                  </choice>, 15, 16, 17. The Three Books<lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
of <normalised orig="Salomon" auto="true">Solomon</normalised>, and 18, &amp;c. The sixteen Books of the Prophets,<lb/>
will furnish us with the rest, and make up the<lb/>
number of Three and Thirty, neither more nor <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised>.<lb/>
So that here was no room either for Tobit, or them<lb/>
that follow in that order.<lb/>
CIII. At this time lived ISIDORUS the Bishop<lb/>
of <normalised orig="Siville" auto="false">Seville</normalised> in Spain, and <normalised orig="Schollar" auto="true">Scholar</normalised> to S. Gregory the Great.<lb/>
In Three places of his Works we may see what he<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> written concerning the Canonical Books of Scripture.<lb/>
Where he <normalised orig="setteth" auto="true">sets</normalised> forth both S. Hieromes and<lb/>
S. Austins Catalogue; and having first said, "That<lb/>
the Books are divided into Three several Orders, that<lb/>
is to say, The Law, The Prophets, and the Hagiographa";<lb/>
(reckoning them as S. <normalised orig="Hierome" auto="true">Jerome</normalised> did before<lb/>
in his Prologue) he <normalised orig="addeth" auto="true">adds</normalised> afterwards, "That there<lb/>
is a Fourth Order of Books among them, which are<lb/>
not in the Hebrew Canon of the Old Testament." (And<lb/>
if they be not there, they can never be made any Canonical<lb/>
parts of that Testament, truly and properly understood.)<lb/>
Then he <normalised orig="reciteth" auto="true">recites</normalised> the Names of those<lb/>
Books that belong to this Fourth Order; saying no more<lb/>
of them, then S. Austin did before, whom he<lb/>
chiefly affects to follow in expressing the honour that<lb/>
the Church gave to them; which was to number them<lb/>
among the Canonical Books, to make use of them, and<lb/>
to read them to the people; but not to set them in an<lb/>
<normalised orig="Equall" auto="true">Equal</normalised> Rank or Authority with them. As therefore<lb/>
S. Austin ought to be interpreted, that he may<lb/>
not be <normalised orig="conceiv'd" auto="true">conceived</normalised> in the same place and period to contradict<lb/>
himself, so is Isidore. For otherwise his own<lb/>
words will be against him, where he saith <normalised orig="expresly" auto="true">expressly</normalised>,<lb/>
"That as the Holy Scripture <normalised orig="consisteth" auto="true">consists</normalised> of the Old<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="142">141</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
Law, and the New; so the Old Law was first given<lb/>
to the Jews by Moses and the Prophets; and is<lb/>
therefore called the Testament, because it was written,<lb/>
signed, and attested by the Prophets." (And if it<lb/>
were signed or sealed by them, there could be nothing<lb/>
added to it, as a true part of that Testament, when they<lb/>
were gone.) "Again, That Ezra the Prophet set<lb/>
forth and ordained ALL the OLD TESTAMENT<lb/>
in XXII Books, according to the number of the Hebrew<lb/>
Letters; which were all translated after his<lb/>
time out of the Hebrew into Greek, by the LXX Interpreters,<lb/>
Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus; but<lb/>
into Latin by S. <normalised orig="Hierome" auto="true">Jerome</normalised> only; whose Edition (because<lb/>
it was the best, that the Latins had,) generally<lb/>
all the Churches received and used." And out of the<lb/>
Hebrew, they could translate no more Books, then Ezra<lb/>
left <normalised orig="behinde" auto="true">behind</normalised> him in Hebrew, or were extant in that<lb/>
Tongue; as the Books, now in <normalised orig="controversie" auto="true">controversy</normalised> were not:<lb/>
For as they were all written in the Greek Tongue, (at<lb/>

"were the Authors that wrote most of them, neither<lb/>
Isidore, nor any in his time, or since, ever knew." All<lb/>
which, is so clearly, and so truly said by him against<lb/>
the new Roman fancy (for the upholding whereof he<lb/>
is otherwhiles <normalised orig="produc'd" auto="true">produced</normalised>,) that if elsewhere he <normalised orig="seemeth" auto="true">seems</normalised><lb/>
to say any thing in favour of it, (be it to make <normalised orig="Salomon" auto="true">Solomon</normalised><lb/>
the Author of the Book of Wisdom, or to number<lb/>
Ecclesiasticus, and the rest of that 4<hi rend="high">th</hi> Order, among the<lb/>

receive them now, or no, (as many times they<lb/>

Gratian's time the <normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised> Church <normalised orig="acknowledg'd" auto="true">acknowledged</normalised><lb/>
them, and in all times since they were first made,<lb/>
the <normalised orig="Orientall" auto="true">Oriental</normalised> Churches received them into the<lb/>

only as we <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>, and exclude the Rest, as not<lb/>

the Same Canon they allow also the <normalised orig="Councel" auto="true">Council</normalised> of<lb/>

CV. THere are but Two considerable Writers<lb/>
in this Age, that have said any thing<lb/>
concerning our present Question;<lb/>
whereof one is Damascen among the Greeks, and the<lb/>
other Venerable <normalised orig="Bede" auto="true">Bed</normalised> among the English Saxons; both<lb/>
of them being persons of great learning and renown.<lb/>
Damascen was a Priest of Syria, and wrote many<lb/>
Books; but those of the greatest Note are his Four<lb/>
Books De Fide Orthodoxâ, wherein he set forth the<lb/>
Body of Divinity in a far better Method and Order then<lb/>
had been seen before his time. And from him did<lb/>
Peter Lombard, and the Schoolmen of the Latin Church<lb/>
take their pattern. In the last of these Four Books he<lb/>
<normalised orig="treateth" auto="true">treats</normalised> of the Canonical Books of Scripture, and <normalised orig="numbreth" auto="false">numbered</normalised><lb/>
them as his Ancestors in the Oriental Churches<lb/>
had <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> done before him, firmly adhering to the<lb/>
Hebrew Canon, and "<normalised orig="compting" auto="false">counting</normalised> but Two and Twenty<lb/>
Books only," belonging to the OLD Testament which<lb/>
he <normalised orig="reciteth" auto="true">recites</normalised> all in Order, without speaking so much<lb/>
as one word either of the Maccabes, or of Judith,<lb/>
or of Tobit; nor saith he more concerning the Books<lb/>
of <normalised orig="Wisdome" auto="true">Wisdom</normalised>, and Ecclesiasticus, then that they are<lb/>
"elegant and <normalised orig="Vertuous" auto="true">Virtuous</normalised> Writings, but not to be <normalised orig="Numbred" auto="true">Numbered</normalised><lb/>
among the Canonical Books of <normalised orig="Scipture" auto="false">scripture</normalised>, having never<lb/>
been laid up in the Ark of the Covenant." In which<lb/>
passage he altogether <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised> Epiphanius. And<lb/>
yet (by the way) forasmuch as <normalised orig="concernes" auto="true">concerns</normalised> the Ark<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="146">V</fw>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
of the Covenant, if either Epiphanius, or He, be so<lb/>
understood, as that they intended it properly of the<lb/>
Ark, which was made by Moses, and afterwards<lb/>
placed in the First Temple, there is an Error in it;<lb/>
For in that ark there was no Other writing put, but<lb/>
The Two Tables of the Covenant; and when the First<lb/>
Temple was burnt, the Same Ark was lost with it, yet<lb/>
very likely it is, that after the Jews, had built their<lb/>
Second Temple, and received their <normalised orig="compleat" auto="true">complete</normalised> Canon of<lb/>
Scripture from Esra, and the Prophets that lived in his<lb/>
time, they were <normalised orig="carefull" auto="true">careful</normalised> to lay it up, and to keep<lb/>
it there for all succeeding Generations, in Armario<lb/>
Judaice, as Tertullian <normalised orig="calleth" auto="true">calls</normalised> it; but this was<lb/>
different from the Ark of the Covenant, being only a<lb/>
Resemblance of it. Howsoever, this is certain that<lb/>
neither Damascen, nor Epiphanius acknowledged any<lb/>
more Canonical Books of the Old Testament, then what<lb/>
the Hebrews held to be Sacred, and diligently <normalised orig="preserv'd" auto="true">preserved</normalised><lb/>
among them. Which though Coc. and Coffeteau,<lb/>
together with some other such small-wared men,<lb/>
as they be, are not willing to allow us, yet<lb/>
Clictoveus, and Canus, and Covaruvias and<lb/>
Ederus deal more freely and ingenuously with us,<lb/>
confessing that Damascen, and many more be for us.<lb/>
Sixtus Senensis, to prove that the Wisdom of <normalised orig="Salomon" auto="true">Solomon</normalised>,<lb/>
and Ecclesiasticus are both of them Canonical Books of<lb/>
Scripture, <normalised orig="produceth" auto="true">produces</normalised> this place of Damascen and<lb/>
<normalised orig="corrupteth" auto="true">corrupts</normalised> it with an addition of his own, for that<lb/>
the Christians were herein contrary to the <normalised orig="Jewes" auto="true">Jews</normalised>,<lb/>
Damascen never said, nor any thing to that purpose.<lb/>
More sincere are they (but now before cited,) who<lb/>
acknowledge it to be most true, that herein Damascen<lb/>
and the Jews were both of one mind. The Excuse<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="147">146</fw>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
which Canus here <normalised orig="pretendeth" auto="true">pretends</normalised> to make for him, (as if<lb/>
the Matter had never yet been <normalised orig="determin'd" auto="true">determined</normalised> in the<lb/>
Church before Damascens time, what Books were<lb/>
Canonical,) is altogether vain. For both the Judaical,<lb/>
and the Apostolical Church had <normalised orig="determin'd" auto="true">determined</normalised> it, and all<lb/>
the Churches following had submitted to that determination;<lb/>
though in the mean while, if we should take<lb/>
Canus at his word, he would be taken by it in his<lb/>
own Snare: For if the Question were not yet <normalised orig="determin'd" auto="true">determined</normalised><lb/>
at the time when Damascen lived, he cannot<lb/>
with any colour say (as he <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> often,) that either<lb/>
Innocent, or the <normalised orig="Councel" auto="true">Council</normalised> of Carthage, or Gelasius had<lb/>
<normalised orig="determin'd" auto="true">determined</normalised> it so long before. After all this, there is<lb/>
a Sermon <normalised orig="father'd" auto="true">fathered</normalised> upon Damascen, wherein the<lb/>
Books of the Maccabes are said to be Divine Scriptures;<lb/>
but in the same Sermon the writings also of S. Denys<lb/>
are said to be Divine and Venerable <normalised orig="Bookes" auto="true">Books</normalised>;<lb/>
(which yet never man <normalised orig="lodg'd" auto="true">lodged</normalised> or <normalised orig="numbred" auto="true">numbered</normalised> among<lb/>
the Canonical Parts of the Bible,) besides, this Sermon<lb/>
is so full of fables and impertinences, that no wise<lb/>
or sober man can ever take it, to be any part of his<lb/>
writing, whose Name it <normalised orig="beareth" auto="true">bears</normalised>. And yet they<lb/>
have nothing else to bring out of Damascen against<lb/>
us.<lb/>
CVI. VENERABLE <normalised orig="BEDE" auto="true">BED</normalised> (So stiled in the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Councel" auto="true">Council</normalised> of Aix,) Who was born and bred up,<lb/>
lived and <normalised orig="dyed" auto="true">died</normalised> in the Church of England, <normalised orig="yieldeth" auto="true">yields</normalised><lb/>
divers Testimonies, that he knew of no Other Books<lb/>
to be Received there, as the Canonical Parts of Divine<lb/>
Scripture, but what we Receive there also at this day<lb/>
in our <normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised> Confession or Articles of Religion. For<lb/>
in his Commentary upon the Revelation, he <normalised orig="reduceth" auto="true">reduces</normalised><lb/>
the Books of the Old Testament to the same Number,<lb/>
wherein both Tertullian, S. Jerome, and Primasius,<lb/>
which others above cited, had represented them<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="148">V2</fw>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
before; and in his Commentaries upon the Kings<lb/>
he <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <normalised orig="asmuch" auto="true">as much</normalised>; <normalised orig="elswhere" auto="true">elsewhere</normalised> making no other Division<lb/>
of them, then into those Three Classes (commonly<lb/>
received by the Hebrews) of 1. The Law, 2. The<lb/>
Prophets, and 3. The Hagiographa. Besides in his<lb/>
Book of the Six Ages of the world, he <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised> the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Accompt" auto="true">Account</normalised> of Eusebius (<normalised orig="afore" auto="true">before</normalised> mentioned) and <normalised orig="remarkeably" auto="false">remarkably</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="distinguisheth" auto="true">distinguishes</normalised> the Books of the Maccabes from<lb/>
the Divine Scripture, coupling them with the writings<lb/>
of Iosephus, and Iulius the African, which is an evident<lb/>
Argument, that he reckoned them not to be Canonical.<lb/>
And though he <normalised orig="allegoriseth" auto="false">allegorised</normalised> the <normalised orig="Historie" auto="true">History</normalised> of Father<lb/>
Tobit (as he <normalised orig="call's" auto="false">calls</normalised> it,) where if he had held it to be<lb/>
a Book of Canonical Scripture, he might have taken<lb/>
occasion enough to have said it, yet in all his discourse<lb/>
there, he <normalised orig="speaketh" auto="true">speaks</normalised> not a word to any such purpose.<lb/>
His Commentaries upon Genesis, and the Kings, were<lb/>
<normalised orig="somtimes" auto="true">sometimes</normalised> <normalised orig="falsly" auto="true">falsely</normalised> attributed to Eucherius the Bishop<lb/>
of Lions; and howsoever Andrew Schott imagined,<lb/>
that neither He, nor <normalised orig="Bede" auto="true">Bed</normalised> was the Author of them,<lb/>
yet we have more reason to believe the Author himself,<lb/>
declaring both his own Country, and his own<lb/>
Writings, which were his Books of the Tabernacle,<lb/>
and the Priestly Habits, belonging to <normalised orig="Bede" auto="true">Bed</normalised>, and to<lb/>
none else.<lb/>
CVII. Photius in the beginning of his Bibliotheque<lb/>
<normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> us, that among other Books he had read<lb/>
an Introduction to the Holy Scriptures, written by a<lb/>
certain known Author in those times under the name<lb/>
of ADRIAN; and he <normalised orig="commendeth" auto="true">commends</normalised> the Book to them<lb/>
that study the knowledge of the Bible. At the beginning<lb/>
of this last Age this Book was set forth at Auspurg.<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="149">148</fw>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
And though we <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> no <normalised orig="expresse" auto="true">express</normalised> Catalogue in it of<lb/>
the Canonical Books of Scripture <normalised orig="receited" auto="false">recited</normalised> in their order,<lb/>
yet the Testimonies that he <normalised orig="bringeth" auto="true">brings</normalised> out of the Scriptures<lb/>
being very many, we <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> never a One produced<lb/>
out of those Books that be now in debate; which<lb/>
is an evident <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised>, that he held them not to be any<lb/>
parts of Canonical Scripture. We <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised> this Author to<lb/>
the end of this Century; for if Photius read him, he<lb/>
was at least so Ancient, if he lived not in the Age<lb/>
before.<lb/>

by Charles the Great into France, and there <normalised orig="imployed" auto="true">employed</normalised><lb/>
as his chief Tutor in all Learning both Secular and<lb/>
Sacred. Among other of his Works, there is One that<lb/>
he wrote against Elipantus the Bishop of Toledo in<lb/>
Spain; who to maintain his Error touching the Adoption<lb/>
of Christ, had produced for his proof a saying<lb/>
out of Ecclesiasticus; having no other Scripture, or<lb/>
proof out of all the Canonical Prophets to <normalised orig="alledge" auto="true">allege</normalised> for<lb/>
himself. The Answer that Alcuin <normalised orig="returneth" auto="true">returns</normalised> to this<lb/>
Proof, makes it clear, that Ecclesiasticus was none <choice ana="print">

                  <lb/>
the Canonical Books in his Bible. For first, he tells<lb/>
Elipantus, "That the Prophets of God failed him, whereof<lb/>
he had never a one to bring for the defence of his<lb/>
Error; And then, that the Book of the Son of Sirach,<lb/>
which he had produced, was both by S. Jeromes<lb/>
and Isidores undoubted Testimonies, reputed but an<lb/>
APOCRYPHAL, and a DVBIOVS SCRIPTURE;<lb/>
having not been written in the time of the Prophets,<lb/>
but in the time of the Priests only, under Simon and<lb/>
Ptolomie." By which words it is manifest, that neither<lb/>
Alcuin, nor the Church of England, where he had<lb/>
been bred, nor the Church of France, where he then<lb/>
lived, had any such belief concerning those Apocryphal<lb/>
and Dubious Books of Scripture, (whereof Ecclesiasticus<lb/>
is but One, as the Church of Rome, and her Adherents<lb/>
have had of them all, ever since the <normalised orig="Councel" auto="true">Council</normalised> of<lb/>
Trent made them Canonical, and Equal to the Law and<lb/>
the Prophets of God.<lb/>
CIX. This that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been said by Alcuin, will<lb/>
help us to another Testimony given for us in his time,<lb/>
and to understand it right, When CHARLES the<lb/>
GREAT, or some other Ecclesiastical Men under his<lb/>
Name, that wrote the Books of Images in opposition<lb/>
to the Greeks and the Second <normalised orig="Councel" auto="true">Council</normalised> of Nice,) made<lb/>
an open profession of the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Faith which they<lb/>
had received from their Ancestors, and the holy Fathers<lb/>
of the Church. Of that Faith this was one Article,<lb/>

which the Authority of the <normalised orig="CATHOLICK" auto="true">CATHOLIC</normalised> CHURCH<lb/>
had delivered to them." And these were no other,<lb/>
then what we acknowledge our selves. For <normalised orig="Charlemaine" auto="true">Charlemain</normalised><lb/>
herein followed Alcuin's doctrine, to whom he<lb/>
                  <pb n="16"/>
                  <lb/>
had committed the care of setting forth the Bible.<lb/>
CX. At this time NICEPHORUS was Patriarch<lb/>
of Constantinople; whose <normalised orig="Chronologie" auto="true">Chronology</normalised> is extant, as it<lb/>
was set forth of old by Anastasius in Latin, and not<lb/>
long since by Camerarius, and Contius; The Greek<lb/>
<normalised orig="Copie" auto="true">Copy</normalised> of it is to be seen at the end of Scaligers Notes<lb/>
upon Eusebius, and among the lesser works of Pithoeus.<lb/>
In this <normalised orig="Chronologie" auto="true">Chronology</normalised> he <normalised orig="numbreth" auto="false">numbered</normalised> the Books first,<lb/>
that are received by the Church for certain and Canonical<lb/>
Scriptures; afterwards he <normalised orig="addeth" auto="true">adds</normalised> both them<lb/>
that are contradicted or doubtful, and them that are<lb/>
<normalised orig="meerly" auto="true">merely</normalised> Apocryphal; herein following Athanasius, before<lb/>
<normalised orig="alledged" auto="true">alleged</normalised>.<lb/>
CXI. RABANUS MAURUS the Arch-Bishop of<lb/>
Mentz, and <normalised orig="Schollar" auto="true">Scholar</normalised> of Alcuin, altogether <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised><lb/>
Isidore, and transcribes him. Isidore and S. Jerome<lb/>
are said by Alcuin to be both of one <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>;<lb/>
and we may well number them All for our own Witnesses;<lb/>
for as Isidore, so is Rabanus to be understood.<lb/>
CXII. STRABUS the <normalised orig="Benedictin" auto="true">Benediction</normalised>, who first wrote<lb/>
the Ordinary <normalised orig="Glosse" auto="true">Gloss</normalised> upon the Bible, was Scholar to<lb/>
Rabanus; and writing upon St. Jeromes Prologues<lb/>
there placed before the OLD TESTAMENT,<lb/>
(wherein, according to the Copies then in use, the<lb/>
Book of Tobit is said to be separated from the Divine<lb/>
Scriptures, and <normalised orig="numbred" auto="true">numbered</normalised> among the Hagiographa,)<lb/>
he <normalised orig="findeth" auto="true">finds</normalised> fault with the Transcribers, and saith, that<lb/>
Tobit is to be set among the Apocryphal Books, and not<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="152">151</fw>
                  <pb n="17"/>
                  <lb/>
among the Hagiographal, (properly so called,) whereof<lb/>
there be but Nine, the whole Number of the Canonical<lb/>
Books being no more then XXII in all.<lb/>
CXIII. AGOBARDUS was now Bishop of Lyons<lb/>
in France; who in his Discourse of the Leviticall<lb/>
<normalised orig="Priviledges" auto="true">Privileges</normalised>, taking occasion from the Number which<lb/>
Moses and Aaron by Gods commandment had made<lb/>
of them in the Desert, saith <normalised orig="expresly" auto="true">expressly</normalised>, That of the Old<lb/>
Testament there are but XXII Books of Divine Authority.<lb/>
Wherein he clearly <normalised orig="maintaineth" auto="true">maintains</normalised> the Doctrine of<lb/>
Josephus, and the Greek Fathers, together with the<lb/>
Prologues of S. Jerome, and the Article of the Church<lb/>
of England.<lb/>
CXIV. ANASTASIUS BIBLIOTHECARIUS,<lb/>
and an Abbot of Rome, did not only translate, but<lb/>
<normalised orig="amplifie" auto="true">amplify</normalised> the words of Nicephorus (before recited)<lb/>
in his <normalised orig="Chronologie" auto="true">Chronology</normalised>, as knowing well, that neither the<lb/>
Maccabes, nor Wisdom, nor Ecclesiasticus, nor Susanna,<lb/>
nor Judith, nor Tobit were received for any Canonical<lb/>
Books by the Church.<lb/>
CXV. AMBROSIUS ANSBERTUS, commended<lb/>
by Sigebert, Trithemius, and Sixtus Senensis, for<lb/>
a person very Learned in the Scriptures, shall end this<lb/>
Century. Who in his Commentary upon the <normalised orig="Apocalyps" auto="true">Apocalypse</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="receiveth" auto="true">receives</normalised> no more Books into Canonical Authority<lb/>
of the first Testament, then these already named had<lb/>
done before him. For the Number of XXIV <normalised orig="maketh" auto="true">makes</normalised><lb/>
no difference from the former <normalised orig="Accompt" auto="true">Account</normalised> of XXII, the<lb/>
one <normalised orig="joyning" auto="true">joining</normalised> the Book of Judges with Ruth, and the<lb/>
Prophecy of Jeremy with the Lamentations; the other<lb/>
reckoning them apart, every one by themselves, but<lb/>
both excluding the same Books that we exclude from<lb/>
the <normalised orig="Authentick" auto="true">Authentic</normalised> and True Canon of Divine Scripture.<lb/>
And in this Age there are no other Ecclesiastical Authors<lb/>
to be found, that have said any thing to this particular<lb/>
Question.<lb/>
