NARRATIVE<lb/>
OF THE<lb/>
LIFE and DEATH<lb/>
Of the Renowned <normalised orig="Dutchess" auto="true">Duchess</normalised><lb/>
DUDLEY<lb/>
Who departed this Life in her<lb/>
House <normalised orig="neer" auto="true">near</normalised> the Church of St. Giles in the<lb/>
Fields, <notvariant>Januarii</notvariant> 22. <notvariant>Anno</notvariant> 1669. in<lb/>
the <notvariant>XC</notvariant>. year of her Age.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
WE never read of any that were blamed for<lb/>
drawing of too much water out of the<lb/>
Well of Life, I mean for devoting themselves<lb/>
with an earnest <notvariant>assiduity</notvariant> to the reading<lb/>
and study of Gods Word: Neither can we possibly<lb/>
give too much honour to the Lord of Glory, and<lb/>
King of Saints, though we should put our inventions<lb/>
upon the rack, and <normalised orig="scrue" auto="false">screw</normalised> up our expressions to the<lb/>
highest.<lb/>
There be many ways and divers means, whereby<lb/>
God may be glorified by us, but none more effectual<lb/>
and powerful to the advancement of his glory, than by<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="2">B</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
acknowledging with due praises the many eminent<lb/>
Virtues, which (as so many Rivulets) stream into<lb/>
the Souls of the Saints from the everlasting Spring of<lb/>
Divine Grace. <quote type="biblical" ana="Gal 1.24">They glorified God in me,</quote> so said<lb/>
S. Paul of himself, Gal. 1.24. Who, though he stiled<lb/>
himself out of the depth of humility the chiefest of<lb/>
sinners, and the least of Saints; yet in Gods esteem he<lb/>
was as great as the greatest of the Latter, and Less then<lb/>
the least of the former.<lb/>
Now to the glory of God (which is the aim of my<lb/>
weak endeavours) to the praise of his eternal goodness<lb/>
(which should be the object of yours) I shall,<lb/>
by his Blessing and Divine Assistance, discharge a duty<lb/>
which is <normalised orig="pattern'd" auto="true">patterned</normalised> to us by the practice of the Heathens,<lb/>
Jews, and Christians in all ages; it is to present to<lb/>
the view of your Meditations one of the Fairest Flowers<lb/>

whilst I embalm the memory of the most Virtuous deceased<lb/>
<notvariant>Dutches</notvariant> D. with a just <notvariant>Encomium</notvariant>, and praises<lb/>
due to her rare and transcendent perfections.<lb/>
In the doing whereof I shall perform a double commendable<lb/>
work; First, A Duty of Civility and Christianity<lb/>
to the dead; Secondly, A Duty of Piety to the<lb/>
Living, whilst I stir up their Devotions to an Holy<lb/>
Emulation and Zealous Imitation of the Graces and<lb/>
Virtues which Shined in the Life and Death of the<lb/>
Renowned <normalised orig="Dutchess" auto="true">Duchess</normalised>; <notvariant>NoValue</notvariant>

                  <lb/>
all that I can, being not able to speak enough, may incur<lb/>
that censure of endeavouring, or going about, to<lb/>
fit a Dwarfs Shoe to a Giants Foot.<lb/>
But to hold your expectation no longer in suspense<lb/>
I shall lay the Foundation of this Structure in Her Graces<lb/>
Birth, and Education, and then lay upon it the<lb/>
weight of an Holy Life, and happy Death, this done,<lb/>
refer all to your godly imitation, and so commend you<lb/>
to God's blessing.<lb/>
First, For her <normalised orig="Ladiships" auto="true">Ladyships</normalised> Birth: we have here a Righteous<lb/>
Branch sprung of a Righteous Stock, She was the<lb/>
second Daughter of Sir Thomas <notvariant>Leighe</notvariant> of <notvariant>Stoneley</notvariant> in<lb/>
the County of <notvariant>Wa'wick</notvariant>, Knight and Baronet, the <normalised orig="Relict" auto="false">Relic</normalised><lb/>
of Sir <normalised orig="Robrt" auto="false">Robert</normalised> Dudley Knight, Son to Robert late Earl<lb/>
of Leicester; and for his extraordinary merits created<lb/>
a Duke by Ferdinand the Second, late Emperor of<lb/>
Germany.<lb/>
For divers great considerations, She was by Letters<lb/>
Patents, bearing date at Oxford the twentieth day of<lb/>
May, In the twentieth year of King Charles the first of<lb/>
Blessed Memory, By the said King advanced to the title<lb/>
of a <normalised orig="Dutchess" auto="true">Duchess</normalised>, being by the <normalised orig="foresaid" auto="true">aforesaid</normalised> Robert the Mother<lb/>
of five gracious Daughters, Alice, <notvariant>Douglasse</notvariant>,<lb/>
Frances wife of Sir Gilbert <notvariant>Kniueton</notvariant> Knight, Anne wife<lb/>
of Sir Robert <notvariant>Holburne</notvariant> Late of <notvariant>Lincolnes</notvariant> <normalised orig="Inne" auto="true">Inn</normalised> (all<lb/>
these Deceased,) And Katherine the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> surviving<lb/>
Picture in Piety and goodness of her Lady Mother,<lb/>
and Widow of Sir Richard <notvariant>Leveson</notvariant> Knight of the<lb/>
Bath.<lb/>
The Town of <notvariant>Stonely</notvariant>, in which our Illustrious <normalised orig="Dutchess" auto="true">Duchess</normalised><lb/>
was born, has more reason to glory in that She<lb/>
<normalised orig="breath'd" auto="true">breathed</normalised> her first breath in it than the seven Cities<lb/>
had in Homer the Prince of Poets; who by all of them<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="4">B2</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
was challenged, all laying a claim or Title to his birth<lb/>
in them. But as her <normalised orig="Ladiships" auto="true">Ladyships</normalised> being born in the <normalised orig="foresaid" auto="true">aforesaid</normalised><lb/>
<notvariant>Stoneley</notvariant> will not add any inward virtue (though it<lb/>
may an outward luster) to it, so Her being descended<lb/>
from, and related to an Ancient Noble Family is the<lb/>
slenderest part or piece of her Character and Glory.<lb/>
That she was born of God by Spiritual Regeneration<lb/>
(and so His Daughter by Adoption) and a Sister of<lb/>
Christ by love and likeness of Him, this is her Chiefest<lb/>
glory, the highest degree of her commendation.<lb/>
                  <notvariant>NoValue</notvariant>
                  <lb/>
So said S. <notvariant>Chrysostome</notvariant> in a <notvariant>Panegyrical</notvariant><lb/>
Oration, The principal thing to be <normalised orig="look'd" auto="true">looked</normalised> at, and commended<lb/>
in recounting a Genealogy, is the Virtue of a<lb/>
man or woman.<lb/>
If we consider the whole Series or course of her<lb/>
life, we shall have a just occasion to say, that in her<lb/>
person, and by her actions she gave a stop or check in<lb/>
a way of answer to that doubtful Question of Solomon,<lb/>
<notvariant>Prov</notvariant>. 31.10. <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 31.10">Who can find a Virtuous Woman!</quote>
                  <lb/>
who can without God's special blessing obtained<lb/>
by Prayer unto Him, and without God's Divine<lb/>
appointment and Ordination? This sure was the<lb/>
<normalised orig="wisemans" auto="false">wiseman's</normalised> meaning. But to return to my purpose<lb/>
from this short digression. The precious <normalised orig="balme" auto="true">balm</normalised> of<lb/>
Grace that was <normalised orig="powred" auto="true">powered</normalised> by God's blessed Spirit into<lb/>
the Soul of our Renowned <normalised orig="Dutchess" auto="true">Duchess</normalised> at her Baptism,<lb/>
or in her Infancy, being <normalised orig="strengthned" auto="true">strengthened</normalised> with the addition<lb/>
of a godly Education, brake forth in such a sweet perfume,<lb/>
even from her Childhood to Her riper years;<lb/>
that she was <normalised orig="look'd" auto="true">looked</normalised> upon as an Earthly Saint, an Angel<lb/>
clothed in Flesh, a lawful Image of Her Maker,<lb/>
and Redeemer, a model of Heaven made up in<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
Clay, the living Temple of the Holy Ghost.<lb/>
This was evidenced by these ensuing Graces.<lb/>
First, By Her Extraordinary Piety, or Religion.<lb/>
Her behaviour towards God was rare and admirable;<lb/>
for being instructed in, and <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> of the<lb/>
truth of that Religion which we profess (as distinct<lb/>
from that false one of the Church of Rome) and being<lb/>
firmly grounded in those Fundamentals, and saving<lb/>
Truths which our Religion teaches us, viz. That God<lb/>
alone is to be prayed unto and worshipped (not Saints<lb/>
nor Angels,) That by Christ only we can be saved,<lb/>
by his merits and Gods mercy, not by our own works,<lb/>
she accordingly upon these grounds <quote type="biblical" ana="Lk 2.37">served God night<lb/>
and day</quote> (as that good old Prophetess Anna did, Luke<lb/>
2.37.) <quote type="biblical" ana="Lk 2.37">with <notvariant>fastings</notvariant> and prayers,</quote> especially during the<lb/>
time of her Virgin-widowhood; she was <notvariant>NoValue</notvariant>
                  <lb/>
1 Tim. 5.5. <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Tim 5.5">a widow indeed,</quote> such as was that famous<lb/>
Paula and <notvariant>Marcella</notvariant> by S. <notvariant>Hierome</notvariant> in his Epistles so<lb/>
highly magnified. She well knew, that though second<lb/>
marriage is no sin, yet (as one says) <notvariant>Iteratò</notvariant> <notvariant>nubere</notvariant> est<lb/>
<notvariant>signum</notvariant> <notvariant>Incontinentia</notvariant>, &amp;c. She therefore, to preserve<lb/>
in her fame the honour, and in her soul and body the<lb/>
joy and sweet content of <normalised orig="Continency" auto="false">Continence</normalised>, refused to marry;<lb/>
declaring thereby, that though many great persons<lb/>
wanted her or rather (as the fashion of the world is)<lb/>
her money, yet she had no need of any to be <normalised orig="joyn'd" auto="true">joined</normalised><lb/>
with her in a conjugal society.<lb/>
An enlargement of her Estate she never designed,<lb/>
nor <normalised orig="desir'd" auto="true">desired</normalised> by the addition of a <normalised orig="Joynture" auto="true">Jointure</normalised>, but moving<lb/>
in the <normalised orig="Sphear" auto="true">Sphere</normalised> of her own fortune, and contenting her<lb/>
self with the portion God had given her, she <notvariant>clave</notvariant><lb/>
close to God, and was <normalised orig="joyn'd" auto="true">joined</normalised> to Him by Faith and<lb/>
<notvariant>Affiance</notvariant>; and so she was espoused to God, and the<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="6">B3</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
Lord of Heaven married to her, being her Husband<lb/>
(as he professes himself to have been to Israel, <notvariant>Jer</notvariant>. 31.<lb/>
32.) in regard of his Love, Care and Providence to<lb/>
her Religious Person; who spent as much time (or<lb/>
more) in reading of God's word, and other godly<lb/>
books the extracts of it, as others do in their Glasses,<lb/>
by which they correct the defaults in their dresses, and<lb/>
blemishes in their faces, not regarding in the mean<lb/>
while the blots and spots, the <notvariant>defilements</notvariant> and stains<lb/>
of sin, that disfigure the native beauty of their Souls,<lb/>
which are usually left naked, and, for want of<lb/>
prayer to God divested of Grace, but clothed<lb/>
with the black mantle of Lascivious and Unclean<lb/>
thoughts.<lb/>
Our pious <normalised orig="Dutchess" auto="true">Duchess</normalised> took into her prime care her<lb/>
righteous soul the spouse of God: by Prayer and Meditation<lb/>
(with which a soul is winged) she sent it up<lb/>
in a flight to Heaven every morning, and thus conversing<lb/>
with God in the mount of Devotion it <normalised orig="return'd" auto="true">returned</normalised><lb/>
again into her <normalised orig="bosome" auto="true">bosom</normalised> (as Moses did from the<lb/>
Mount) with it's face shining, and <notvariant>lightsome</notvariant> with joy<lb/>
and inward Consolation.<lb/>
The more familiar conference we have with<lb/>
God in prayer, the more do we partake of<lb/>
him.<lb/>
He that passes by the fire may have some gleams<lb/>
of heat, but he that stands by it will have his Colour<lb/>
changed: It is not possible a man should have any long<lb/>
conference with God in Prayer, and Meditation, but<lb/>
that his heart shine with inward illumination, and, being<lb/>
<normalised orig="enflamed" auto="true">inflamed</normalised> with the love of God, partake of some<lb/>
Divine Inspiration.<lb/>
And thus she acquainting her self daily and conversing<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="7">6</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
with God, in her Closet, or Private, and more<lb/>
<normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> family devotions (which she never omitted)<lb/>
was wonderfully beautified, and <normalised orig="strengthned" auto="true">strengthened</normalised> in her<lb/>
soul by Grace; which had taken up it's lodging in<lb/>
her, and displayed it self outwardly in five special<lb/>
Saint-like Qualities, which made her conversation<lb/>
amiable, pleasant, and Venerable to all her Equals and<lb/>
Inferiors.<lb/>
The first was a winning and obliging way or disposition,<lb/>
that sweetly scatters favours; by this, being a<lb/>
desire of doing good to all, even to our very<lb/>
enemies, we attract friendships, and make friends<lb/>
even of those that hate us. Thus did that good<lb/>
<normalised orig="Dutchess" auto="true">Duchess</normalised>.<lb/>
The second is Affability, this was eminently in her,<lb/>
<normalised orig="joyn'd" auto="true">joined</normalised> with a becoming Grace and sweet behaviour,<lb/>
and <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> in it a power to charm Souls that are in any<lb/>
the least way or degree inclined to Honesty and Civility:<lb/>
She was Courteous to all even the meanest person,<lb/>
who might find her ear, open to any just Request<lb/>
or Modest Petition. When she bestowed any<lb/>
favour, or gave an Alms, She gave it cheerfully without<lb/>
grudging, or any the least <notvariant>repining</notvariant>, so the loaf<lb/>
which she gave was not <notvariant>Panis</notvariant> <notvariant>Lapidosus</notvariant>, as <notvariant>Seneca</notvariant><lb/>
speaks, but pure and fine <notvariant>Manchet</notvariant> without any mixture<lb/>
of Gravel. An Alms given with hard Language,<lb/>
reproach or an harsh <notvariant>exprobration</notvariant>, is gravel-bread,<lb/>
and at once loses both it's thanks and commendation.<lb/>
The third, Prudence, a gracious Quality of the Soul,<lb/>
which is ever <normalised orig="joyn'd" auto="true">joined</normalised> with Wisdom as it's inseparable<lb/>
Companion, as appears by <notvariant>Eph</notvariant>. 1. 8. - - <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 1.7-8">According to<lb/>
the riches of his Grace, wherein he <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> abounded towards<lb/>
                     <pb n="7"/>
                     <lb/>
us in all Wisdom and Prudence.</quote> So <notvariant>Prov</notvariant>. 8.12.<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 8.12">I Wisdom dwell with Prudence,</quote> Here too they are mated,<lb/>
they cannot be severed. The property of Wisdom,<lb/>
is <notvariant>NoValue</notvariant>, to propound to it self a right or good end,<lb/>
as it is the Office of Prudence, (which derives it's name<lb/>
from Providence) <notvariant>NoValue</notvariant> to advise of and devise<lb/>
proper and fit means suitable to that end. To be<lb/>
happy hereafter in Heaven and to live honourably<lb/>
with repute here on Earth, should be our main end:<lb/>
Faith in Christ attended with good works is the way<lb/>
to attain the former, Justice and Honesty to man is the<lb/>
means to acquire the other.<lb/>
This virtue, this <notvariant>NoValue</notvariant>, was most eminent in our<lb/>
Renowned <normalised orig="Dutchess" auto="true">Duchess</normalised>, she made it her whole business,<lb/>
her <notvariant>NoValue</notvariant> to get a place in Heaven, (where she now<lb/>
sits and <normalised orig="raigns" auto="false">reigns</normalised>) and by well-doing to leave a good<lb/>
name behind her, being dead; that the <normalised orig="transplendent" auto="false">transplanted</normalised><lb/>
light of her beneficence shining amongst men, and<lb/>
they beholding her good works <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 5.16">might <normalised orig="glorifie" auto="true">glorify</normalised> her Father<lb/>
which is in Heaven</quote>, Matt. 5.16.<lb/>
Her Prudence likewise was seen in this that she had<lb/>
a great command over her Tongue, and Passions; she<lb/>
knew that (as Th. de <notvariant>Kempis</notvariant> says well, lib. 1.c. 20.)<lb/>
It was an easier thing to be silent then not to offend in<lb/>
speech, or multitude of words: she therefore seldom<lb/>
<normalised orig="spake" auto="false">spoke</normalised> but to the benefit of the Hearer; Grieve she did<lb/>
at the miscarriages of men (whereby God was dishonoured)<lb/>
and for <normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> calamities when the Church<lb/>
was afflicted, but this sorrow was allayed with Religion,<lb/>
it never exceeded; Thus also her Anger was<lb/>
tempered with Meekness, so that if at any time her<lb/>
blood boiled up in her tender heart out of a dislike of<lb/>
any thing that did offend her, it never ran over the<lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
brim of Reason, or bounds of Moderation. Her ears<lb/>

Matt. 11.29. The Doctrinal saying of this great<lb/>
Master of <normalised orig="Humilty" auto="false">Humility</normalised>. It is grounded upon an high apprehension<lb/>
of the Majesty and Greatness of Almighty<lb/>
God, together with a low estimation a man <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> of<lb/>
himself, in regard of his many weaknesses, and sinful<lb/>
Infirmities; These being ever proposed to the eye of<lb/>
Her Conscience, and looking upon all the good things<lb/>
She had, her Gifts and Graces, as God's <notvariant>Donatives</notvariant>,<lb/>
(who can and will, if we be proud of them to a contempt<lb/>

ever payed to God the Tribute of thankfulness for<lb/>
them, bowing Her Soul to God by an humble submission<lb/>
to His Will, and to the just commands of<lb/>
her <normalised orig="Superiours" auto="true">Superiors</normalised>; being likewise assured of this, that if<lb/>
she had more riches, others might have more Grace,<lb/>
and if she exceeded them in one or more gifts, they<lb/>
might excel in others. Hence did spring and arise Her<lb/>
meekness, and Humility, a Grace which renders a<lb/>
man amiable in the sight of God, who <normalised orig="dwels" auto="true">dwells</normalised> (as<lb/>
the Prophet <notvariant>Isaiah</notvariant> speaks, chap. 57.11.) in an<lb/>

<notvariant>Kempis</notvariant> says of man in General) that she was Culpable in<lb/>
many things, prone by nature to evil, and unable of her<lb/>
self to stand and persist in that which is good. This knowledge<lb/>
of her self beat down Pride, and set up a throne<lb/>
for Humility in her heart, which displayed it self by her<lb/>
delighting to be concealed by her private retirement,<lb/>
yet shining in goodness though unseen, like those stars<lb/>

<normalised orig="shind" auto="true">shined</normalised> most gloriously, the fire of her Zeal to the<lb/>

those, who did persecute her with their hands robbing<lb/>

and blasting her reputation with their black Tongues<lb/>
not dreading to report she was a <notvariant>Papist</notvariant>, or (as one<lb/>

why? Because she was loyal to her <normalised orig="Soveraign" auto="true">Sovereign</normalised>, a lover<lb/>

in good works. If it were only Charity that did<lb/>
constitute a <notvariant>Papist</notvariant>, I would not refuse or dislike to be<lb/>

Her Patience likewise discovered it self highly all<lb/>
the time of her sickness which was long and tedious,<lb/>

of that great Ocean of bliss in Heaven,<lb/>
to which she was sailing through the narrow channel<lb/>
of this life: She never complained with murmuring<lb/>
or bitter Lamentation, as too many do in their sickness,<lb/>
nor saying as <notvariant>Rebekah</notvariant> did, Gen. 25.22. when<lb/>

the death of <notvariant>Blasilla</notvariant>, The Lord is good, and<lb/>
whatsoever a good God <normalised orig="doth" auto="false">does</normalised> cannot be bad. To<lb/>

Now that her Soul was drawing towards Heaven,<lb/>
having spent all the time of her sickness in Prayer and<lb/>
Repentance, and heavenly Conferences, of which I<lb/>

oft-times before) desired to receive her last <notvariant>Viaticum</notvariant>
                  <lb/>
that heavenly food, which might (as it did)<lb/>
strengthen her Spirit in it's last conflict with Death,<lb/>
and in it's long journey to eternity, or everlasting<lb/>
life; I mean that which is a Sacrament,<lb/>
as of a thankful Commemoration of Christ crucified,<lb/>
so of a blessed Confirmation, for that it confirms<lb/>
our Faith that Christ is, and will be in all<lb/>
respects to our Souls (I had rather say to our<lb/>
Persons) what the Bread and Wine is to our<lb/>
Bodies.<lb/>
Had you been then present and seen with what<lb/>
flaming devotion, with what burning affection, and<lb/>
lowly Reverence upon her Knees (when she could<lb/>
hardly stand upon her feeble legs) she received that<lb/>
heavenly Food that <notvariant>NoValue</notvariant> (as <notvariant>Ign</notvariant>. calls it)<lb/>

had you then beheld her devout deportment, and<lb/>
heard the Divine expressions, which <normalised orig="immediatly" auto="true">immediately</normalised> fell<lb/>
from her gracious lips, you would hence have concluded<lb/>
that she was a rare Saint - - Having thus got a<lb/>
