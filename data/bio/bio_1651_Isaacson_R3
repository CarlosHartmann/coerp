                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
He <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> grew into far greater esteem with her successor<lb/>
the most learned King James, who (to say but truth) admired<lb/>
him beyond all other Divines; not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> for his transcendent<lb/>
gift in Preaching, but for his excellency and <normalised orig="sollidity" auto="false">solidity</normalised><lb/>
in all <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> of Learning; selecting him, as his <normalised orig="choysest" auto="true">choicest</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="peece" auto="true">piece</normalised>, to vindicate his <notvariant>Regality</notvariant> against his <normalised orig="foule-mouthed" auto="false">foul-mouthed</normalised><lb/>
adversaries. His Majesty (not long after his happy entrance<lb/>
to this <normalised orig="Crowne" auto="true">Crown</normalised>) bestowed upon him the <normalised orig="Bishopricke" auto="false">Bishopric</normalised> of<lb/>
Chichester (which he held about <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>) and <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised><lb/>
made him Lord <notvariant>Almoner</notvariant>: and (because of the <notvariant>exility</notvariant> of that<lb/>
<normalised orig="Bishopricke" auto="false">Bishopric</normalised>) soon after added the Parsonage of <notvariant>Cheyham</notvariant> in<lb/>
<notvariant>Surry</notvariant>, to his <notvariant>Commendam</notvariant>.<lb/>
Upon the vacancy of the <normalised orig="Bishopricke" auto="false">Bishopric</normalised> of Ely, his Majesty<lb/>
made him Bishop thereof; and there he sate about nine<lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised>. In which time he was made a <normalised orig="Privie" auto="true">Privy</normalised> <normalised orig="Councellor" auto="false">Councillor</normalised>, first<lb/>
of England &amp; then of Scotland, in his attendance of the King<lb/>
thither. He was afterwards preferred to the <normalised orig="Bishopricke" auto="false">Bishopric</normalised> of<lb/>
Winchester and the <normalised orig="Deanry" auto="true">Deanery</normalised> of the Kings <normalised orig="Chappell" auto="true">Chapel</normalised>, which<lb/>
two last <notvariant>preferments</notvariant> he held to his death, which <normalised orig="hapned" auto="true">happened</normalised><lb/>
about eight <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> after, in the third <normalised orig="yeer" auto="true">year</normalised> of the <normalised orig="raigne" auto="true">reign</normalised> of<lb/>
our late King <notvariant>Charlse</notvariant>; with whom he held no <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> reputation<lb/>
then he had done with his Father before him.<lb/>
It is worth the observation, that having <normalised orig="bin" auto="false">been</normalised> <normalised orig="preferd" auto="true">preferred</normalised> to<lb/>
many, and those no small dignities, yet he never used any<lb/>
<normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> to <normalised orig="obtaine" auto="true">obtain</normalised> the least of them, but they were all <normalised orig="conferd" auto="false">conferred</normalised><lb/>
upon him without the least suit on his part: For he<lb/>
was so <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> from ambition or <normalised orig="covetousnesse" auto="true">covetousness</normalised>, as that when<lb/>
the <normalised orig="Bishopricks" auto="true">Bishoprics</normalised> of Salisbury and Ely were at <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> times<lb/>
<normalised orig="tendred" auto="true">tendered</normalised> unto him upon some propositions, <normalised orig="prejudiciall" auto="true">prejudicial</normalised> to<lb/>
the state of those Churches, he utterly refused them.<lb/>
The <normalised orig="vertues" auto="true">virtues</normalised> and good parts of this <normalised orig="honorable" auto="true">honourable</normalised> Prelate<lb/>
were so many, and those so transcendent, that to <normalised orig="doe" auto="false">do</normalised> him<lb/>
right, a large <normalised orig="volumn" auto="true">volume</normalised> would be but sufficient, which I shall<lb/>
leave to some of better abilities to <normalised orig="performe" auto="true">perform</normalised>, which I shall<lb/>
(by way of an Epitome) <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> point a finger at, in these<lb/>
heads which follow.<lb/>
His first and <normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised> <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised>, was his singular <normalised orig="zeale" auto="true">zeal</normalised> and<lb/>
piety, which <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> in his private and<lb/>
secret Devotions <normalised orig="betweene" auto="true">between</normalised> God and <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> (in which,<lb/>
they that were about him, well perceived, that he daily<lb/>
spent many <normalised orig="houres" auto="true">hours</normalised>, yea, and the greatest part of his life, in<lb/>
holy prayers and abundant <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised>, the <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> whereof they<lb/>
often discovered) but also in his exemplary <normalised orig="publicke" auto="true">public</normalised> prayers<lb/>
with his Family in his <normalised orig="Chappell" auto="true">Chapel</normalised>; wherein he behaved<lb/>
<normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> so humbly, devoutly and reverently, that it could<lb/>
not but move others to follow his example. His <normalised orig="Chappell" auto="true">Chapel</normalised><lb/>
(in which he had Monthly Communions) was so decently<lb/>
and reverently adorned, and God served there with so holy<lb/>
and reverend behaviour of <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> and his Family (by his<lb/>
<normalised orig="patterne" auto="true">pattern</normalised>) that the <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised> of many (that (<notvariant>obiter</notvariant>) came thither<lb/>
in time of Divine Service) were very much elevated,<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
and they stirred up to the like reverend deportment; yea,<lb/>
some that had <normalised orig="bin" auto="false">been</normalised> there, were so taken with it, that they<lb/>
desired to end their <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> in the Bishop of <notvariant>Elyes</notvariant> <normalised orig="Chappell" auto="true">Chapel</normalised>.<lb/>
The next is his Charity and compassion, which he <normalised orig="practized" auto="true">practised</normalised><lb/>
even before he came to great <notvariant>preferments</notvariant>: for while<lb/>
he was yet in private estate, he extended his Charity in <normalised orig="liberall" auto="true">liberal</normalised><lb/>
manner, to the <normalised orig="reliefe" auto="true">relief</normalised> of <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> Parishioners, prisons<lb/>
and prisoners; besides his constant <normalised orig="Sundayes" auto="true">Sundays</normalised> <normalised orig="Almes" auto="true">Alms</normalised> at his<lb/>
Parish of Saint Giles. But when his <normalised orig="Meanes" auto="true">Means</normalised> became greater,<lb/>
his Charity <normalised orig="encreased" auto="true">increased</normalised> to a large proportion; releasing<lb/>
many prisoners of all sorts, that were detained either for<lb/>
petty Debts or keepers fees. And one thing in his Charity<lb/>
is remarkable; that whereas he sent much money at <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised><lb/>
times to the <normalised orig="reliefe" auto="true">relief</normalised> of <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> Parishes, Prisons, Prisoners<lb/>
and the like, he gave strict charge to his servants whom<lb/>
he entrusted therewith, that they should not acknowledge<lb/>
whence this <normalised orig="reliefe" auto="true">relief</normalised> came; but directed that the <notvariant>acquittances</notvariant>,<lb/>
which they (to make the discharge of their trust <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised><lb/>
to him) desired from them that received such <normalised orig="reliefe" auto="true">relief</normalised>,<lb/>
should be taken in the name of a Benefactor unknown. Other<lb/>
large sums he bestowed <normalised orig="yeerly" auto="true">yearly</normalised> (and <normalised orig="oftner" auto="false">oftener</normalised>) in clothing<lb/>
the <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> and naked, in relieving the <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised> and needy, in<lb/>
succouring Families in time of infection (besides his <normalised orig="Almes" auto="true">Alms</normalised><lb/>
to <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> house-keepers at his gate:) <normalised orig="insomuch" auto="true">inasmuch</normalised>, that his private<lb/>
<normalised orig="Almes" auto="true">Alms</normalised> in his last six <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> (besides those <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised>) amounted<lb/>
to the <normalised orig="sum" auto="false">some</normalised> of 1300=l=. and upwards. Lastly, though<lb/>
it might well have <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> supposed (by that which is said<lb/>
already) that he had <normalised orig="bin" auto="false">been</normalised> in his life time his own <notvariant>Almoner</notvariant>,<lb/>
yet as he lived a pattern of compassion and <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> of mercy<lb/>
so he <normalised orig="dyed" auto="false">died</normalised> also; for it <normalised orig="appeareth" auto="true">appears</normalised> by his Will, that his chief<lb/>
care was, to provide that his pious <normalised orig="workes" auto="true">works</normalised> should never<lb/>
have end, leaving 4000=l=. to purchase 200=l=. Land per <notvariant>annum</notvariant>
                  <lb/>
for ever, to be distributed by 50=l=. quarterly, thus; To aged<lb/>
<normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> men and decayed (with an <normalised orig="especiall" auto="true">especial</normalised> eye to Sea faring<lb/>
men, <normalised orig="wherin" auto="true">wherein</normalised> he reflected upon his Fathers Profession) 50=l=.<lb/>
To poor <normalised orig="Widowes" auto="true">Widows</normalised>, the <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*iv*s</sic>
                     <corr>wives</corr>
                  </choice> of one Husband fifty pounds.<lb/>
To the binding of poor <choice ana="illegible">

                     <corr>Orphans</corr>
                  </choice> Apprentices fifty pounds.<lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
And to the <normalised orig="reliefe" auto="true">relief</normalised> of <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> Prisoners fifty pounds. Besides<lb/>
(among other, too many to be comprehended in an Epitome)<lb/>
he left, to be distributed presently after his decease,<lb/>
among <normalised orig="Mayd-servants" auto="false">Maid-servants</normalised> of honest report, and who had served<lb/>
one <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>M*<notvariant>ster</notvariant></sic>
                     <corr>Master</corr>
                  </choice> or <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> seven <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised>, the <normalised orig="sum" auto="false">some</normalised> of two hundred<lb/>
pounds. Lastly, a great part of his Estate (which remained<lb/>
after his <normalised orig="Funerall" auto="true">Funeral</normalised> and Legacies discharged) he left<lb/>
to be distributed among his <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> Servants.<lb/>
The third is his fidelity and integrity; <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised>, upright<lb/>
and just he ever was, whether you respect him in his ordinary<lb/>
transactions, in which no man could ever justly <normalised orig="taxe" auto="true">tax</normalised><lb/>
him with the least aspersion of injustice; or whether you<lb/>
<normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> upon him as entrusted with those great Offices and<lb/>
Places which he did <normalised orig="undergoe" auto="true">undergo</normalised>; and they were either his<lb/>
<normalised orig="Spirituall" auto="true">Spiritual</normalised> <notvariant>preferments</notvariant> or <normalised orig="Temporall" auto="true">Temporal</normalised> Office, besides some<lb/>
other matters committed to his fidelity. In the first of which<lb/>
he declared evidently to the world, that he reputed himself<lb/>
but Gods Steward, and that he must give an account to his<lb/>
Lord and Master for them. To begin then with the lowest<lb/>
account: He was ever <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised>, provident and <normalised orig="carefull" auto="true">careful</normalised> to<lb/>
<normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> in good <normalised orig="repaire" auto="true">repair</normalised> the Houses of all his <normalised orig="Spirituall" auto="true">Spiritual</normalised> <notvariant>preferments</notvariant>,<lb/>
and spent much money that way; as upon the<lb/>
Vicarage house of Saint Giles, the <notvariant>Prebends</notvariant> and <normalised orig="Deanes" auto="false">Dean's</normalised><lb/>
houses of Westminster, and the <notvariant>Residentiaries</notvariant> house of Saint<lb/>
<normalised orig="Pauls" auto="false">Paul's</normalised>. Upon the House belonging to the <normalised orig="Bishopricke" auto="false">Bishopric</normalised> of<lb/>
Chichester, he expended above 420 l. Of <normalised orig="Elye" auto="false">Ely</normalised> above 2440 l.<lb/>
Of <notvariant>Winchesters</notvariant> (besides a <normalised orig="Pention" auto="true">Pension</normalised> of 400 l.per <notvariant>annum</notvariant>, from<lb/>
which he freed his See at his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> charge) he spent two<lb/>
thousand pounds.<lb/>
But in that part of the Account which concerned him<lb/>
more <normalised orig="neerly" auto="true">nearly</normalised> to perfect, which was his <normalised orig="Pastorall" auto="true">Pastoral</normalised> and <normalised orig="Episcopall" auto="false">Episcopal</normalised><lb/>
charge, the cure of <normalised orig="Soules" auto="true">Souls</normalised>, and the well ordering of<lb/>
the <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> <normalised orig="Diocesse" auto="true">Diocese</normalised> committed to his trust, never any<lb/>
made a more just and exact account.<lb/>
Some particulars of this account was, the promoting<lb/>
of sufficient, able and good men to Livings and <notvariant>preferments</notvariant><lb/>
which fell within his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> gift. To the better discharge<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
of this part of the account he <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> order still before hand,<lb/>
by <normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised> search and enquiry, to know what <normalised orig="hopefull" auto="true">hopeful</normalised><lb/>
young men were in the University: his <normalised orig="Chapleins" auto="false">Chaplains</normalised> and<lb/>
friends receiving a charge from him, to <normalised orig="certifie" auto="true">certify</normalised> him, what<lb/>
<normalised orig="hopefull" auto="true">hopeful</normalised> and <normalised orig="towardly" auto="false">cowardly</normalised> young wit they met with at any<lb/>
time: and these (till he could better provide for them) were<lb/>
sure to taste of his bounty and <normalised orig="goodnesse" auto="true">goodness</normalised>, for their better<lb/>
encouragement.<lb/>
Diverse eminent men in Learning that wanted preferment,<lb/>
when any thing fell in his <normalised orig="guift" auto="true">gift</normalised> convenient for them<lb/>
(though otherwise they had no <normalised orig="dependance" auto="true">dependence</normalised> at all upon<lb/>
him, nor interest in him) he would send for, before they<lb/>
knew why, and <normalised orig="entertaine" auto="true">entertain</normalised> them in his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> house, and<lb/>
<normalised orig="conferre" auto="true">confer</normalised> the preferment upon them, and also defray the<lb/>
very charges incident for a dispensation or a faculty, yea,<lb/>
of their very journey; and all this, that he might have his<lb/>
<normalised orig="Diocesse" auto="true">Diocese</normalised> in <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised>, and his <notvariant>preferments</notvariant> in particular,<lb/>
the better fitted: So that, that may fitly be <normalised orig="applyed" auto="true">applied</normalised> to<lb/>
him, which was sometimes to Saint <notvariant>Chrysostome</notvariant>. In <notvariant>administratione</notvariant><lb/>
<notvariant>Epatus</notvariant>, <notvariant>prebuit</notvariant> se <notvariant>fidelem</notvariant>, <notvariant>constantem</notvariant>, &amp; <notvariant>Vigilantem</notvariant><lb/>
<notvariant>Ministerum</notvariant> <notvariant>Christi</notvariant>.
                  <lb/>
And if you <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> upon him in those <notvariant>Temporales</notvariant> <normalised orig="wherwith" auto="true">wherewith</normalised><lb/>
he was <normalised orig="intrusted" auto="true">entrusted</normalised>, you shall find him no <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised><lb/>
and just: As first, diverse <normalised orig="summes" auto="true">sums</normalised> (and many of them of good<lb/>
value) were sent to him, to be distributed among <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="scholers" auto="true">scholars</normalised>, and others, at his discretion: all which he disposed<lb/>
with great care and fidelity, even according to the<lb/>
Donors minds and <notvariant>entents</notvariant>.<lb/>
For his <normalised orig="faithfulnesse" auto="true">faithfulness</normalised> in managing those places, wherein<lb/>
he was entrusted for others, <normalised orig="joyntly" auto="true">jointly</normalised> with <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, let<lb/>
<normalised orig="Pembrooke" auto="false">Pembroke</normalised> Hall and Westminster <normalised orig="Colledge" auto="true">College</normalised> <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> for him; for<lb/>
when he became Master of the first, he found it in debt, being<lb/>
of a very small endowment, (then <normalised orig="espcially" auto="false">especially</normalised>) but by his<lb/>
faithful providence, he left above eleven hundred pounds in<lb/>
the Treasury of that <normalised orig="Colledge" auto="true">College</normalised>, towards the bettering of the<lb/>
estate thereof. And when he was made <normalised orig="Deane" auto="false">Dean</normalised> of the other,<lb/>
it is not <normalised orig="unknowne" auto="true">unknown</normalised> to some yet living (who will <normalised orig="testfie" auto="false">testify</normalised>)<lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
that he left it for all orders, <normalised orig="aswell" auto="true">as well</normalised> of the Church as of the<lb/>

three hundred such Folio Books of his own, to the <normalised orig="encrease" auto="true">increase</normalised><lb/>

The <normalised orig="fift" auto="true">fifth</normalised> is, his Munificence and Bounty. To prove which<lb/>

thing I cannot <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> over in silence; That when King James<lb/>

what <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> I of these? Was ever Prince better entertained,<lb/>
and in more magnificent but orderly manner, then was his<lb/>
said Majesty at <notvariant>Farneham</notvariant> Castle (one of the Houses belonging<lb/>
to the <normalised orig="Bishopricke" auto="false">Bishopric</normalised> of Winchester) where in the space of<lb/>
three <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> he spent three thousand pounds, to the extraordinary<lb/>
contentment of his Majesty, and the admiration<lb/>
of all his Followers.<lb/>
The next is, his Hospitality: from the first time of his<lb/>
preferment (to <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> of any considerable value) even to<lb/>
his dying day, he was ever Hospitable, and free in entertainment<lb/>
to all people of quality and worthy of respect,<lb/>
especially to <normalised orig="Schollars" auto="true">Scholars</normalised> and Strangers; his Table being ever<lb/>
bountifully and neatly <choice ana="illegible">

<normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> <normalised orig="seldome" auto="true">seldom</normalised> knowing what meat he had, till he came<lb/>
from his Study to Dinner; at which he would <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised><lb/>
so noble in his entertainment, and so gravely <normalised orig="facecious" auto="false">factitious</normalised>,<lb/>
that his guests would often <normalised orig="professe" auto="true">profess</normalised>, they never came<lb/>
to any mans Table, where they received better satisfaction<lb/>
in all points, and that his Lordship kept Christmas all the<lb/>
<normalised orig="yeer" auto="true">year</normalised>, in respect of the plenty they ever found there. And<lb/>
yet (by the way) take this, that he ever strictly observed in<lb/>
his provisions of <normalised orig="dyet" auto="true">diet</normalised>, the time of Lent, Embers, and other<lb/>
Fasting <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, according to the <normalised orig="Lawes" auto="true">Laws</normalised> of this <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised>,<lb/>
and the orders of the Church.<lb/>
I shall not need to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> of the extraordinary great Hospitality<lb/>
he kept, and the large <normalised orig="expence" auto="true">expense</normalised> he was at, in entertainment<lb/>
of all sorts of people in Scotland, at what time he<lb/>
attended King James thither; the Nobility, Clergy, Gentry,<lb/>
and others of both Nations there present, will (as they<lb/>
often already have) <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> of it for me, to his exceeding<lb/>
great honour. So that I know not, whether I have fitly<lb/>
couched it under this Head of Hospitality, or whether it<lb/>
had more properly belonged to that of his Munificence<lb/>
and Bounty.<lb/>
The seventh, is his Humanity and affability, not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised><lb/>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
to the last mentioned (his Guests) but to every one that<lb/>
did converse with him; for which, not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> divers famous<lb/>
Scholars and others of this <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised>, but others of<lb/>
<normalised orig="Forraigne" auto="true">Foreign</normalised> parts (as they had just cause) have admired him.<lb/>

Master <notvariant>Vossius</notvariant>, Master <notvariant>Grotius</notvariant>, Master <notvariant>Moulm</notvariant>, Master<lb/>
Barclay, and (besides many others) Master <notvariant>Erpenius</notvariant>, to whom<lb/>
he tendered an <normalised orig="Annuall" auto="true">Annual</normalised> Stipend, to have read and taught<lb/>
here the <normalised orig="Orientall" auto="true">Oriental</normalised> tongues (wherein long before his death<lb/>

<notvariant>Bedwell</notvariant> (to whom he gave the Vicarage of Tottenham in<lb/>

reason for this, a late reverend Father of this Church <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised><lb/>
given <notvariant>Omnes</notvariant> quid in se <notvariant>amant</notvariant>, in <notvariant>aliis</notvariant> <notvariant>venerantur</notvariant>: loving and<lb/>
<normalised orig="honoring" auto="true">honouring</normalised> those gifts in others which he had in <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>;<lb/>
for among the other parts of his profound Learning, he<lb/>
by his industry, had attained to the knowledge of <normalised orig="fifteene" auto="true">fifteen</normalised><lb/>
tongues, if not more.<lb/>
To these former, may be added his Modesty, which was<lb/>

<normalised orig="especiall" auto="true">especial</normalised> notice of his profound and deep learning, yet was<lb/>

and insufficiency to <normalised orig="undergoe" auto="true">undergo</normalised> such a charge, as also<lb/>
that he might have not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> his Clergy, but all others<lb/>
to take notice thereof, he caused to be <notvariant>engraven</notvariant> about<lb/>

or of those, who (by reason of his <normalised orig="Episcopall" auto="false">Episcopal</normalised> Jurisdiction)<lb/>
attended him: and being quit of these and the like<lb/>
occasions, he would <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised> to his Study, where he spent<lb/>
the rest of the <normalised orig="after-noone" auto="true">afternoon</normalised>, even till Bed-time, except some<lb/>
friend <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> him off to Supper, and then did he eat but<lb/>
sparingly.<lb/>
Of the fruit of this his seed-time, the world (especially<lb/>
this Land) <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> reaped a <normalised orig="plentifull" auto="true">plentiful</normalised> harvest, in his Sermons<lb/>
and writings: Never went any beyond him in the first of<lb/>

some would say of him, that he was <normalised orig="quicke" auto="true">quick</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, as <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised><lb/>

                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="unimitable" auto="false">inimitable</normalised>. So that he was truly stiled Stella <notvariant>perdicantium</notvariant>;<lb/>
and an <normalised orig="Angell" auto="true">Angel</normalised> in the Pulpit. And his late Majesty <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="especiall" auto="true">especial</normalised> care in causing that volume of his Sermons to be<lb/>
divulged (though but a <normalised orig="handfull" auto="true">handful</normalised> of those which he Preached)<lb/>
by enjoying whereof, this <normalised orig="kingdome" auto="true">kingdom</normalised> <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> an inestimable<lb/>
treasure.<lb/>
And for his <normalised orig="acutenesse" auto="true">acuteness</normalised> and profundity in writing against<lb/>
the Adversary, he so excelled all others of his time,<lb/>
that neither <notvariant>Bellarmine</notvariant> (champion to <choice ana="print-error">

nor any other of them, was ever able to <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> what he<lb/>
wrote: So, that as his Sermons were <normalised orig="unimitable" auto="false">inimitable</normalised>, his <normalised orig="writins" auto="false">writings</normalised><lb/>
were unanswerable.<lb/>
To draw to an end of deciphering his <normalised orig="vertues" auto="true">virtues</normalised>, and endowments:<lb/>
It may truly be said of him, that he had those<lb/>
gifts and graces, both of Art and Nature, so fixed in him,<lb/>
as that this age cannot <normalised orig="paralell" auto="true">parallel</normalised> him; for his profundity,<lb/>
and <normalised orig="abisse" auto="false">abuse</normalised> of learning, was accompanied with wit, memory,<lb/>
judgment, Languages, gravity and humility: <normalised orig="insomuch" auto="true">inasmuch</normalised><lb/>
that if he had <normalised orig="bin" auto="false">been</normalised> Contemporary with the Ancient Fathers<lb/>
of the Primitive Church, he would have <normalised orig="bin" auto="false">been</normalised> (and that worthily)<lb/>
reputed, not inferior to the chiefest among them.<lb/>
He generally hated all vices, but three (which he ever reputed<lb/>
<normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised>) were most especially odious unto him. First,<lb/>
Usury, from which he was so <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, that when<lb/>
his friends had need of such money as he could spare, he<lb/>
lent it to them freely, without <normalised orig="expectance" auto="false">expectancy</normalised> of ought <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised>,<lb/>
but the <normalised orig="Principall" auto="true">Principal</normalised>. Secondly, The second was <notvariant>Simony</notvariant><lb/>
which was so detestable to him, as that for refusing to admit<lb/>
diverse men to livings whom he suspected to be <notvariant>Simonically</notvariant><lb/>
<normalised orig="preferd" auto="true">preferred</normalised>, he suffered much by suits of Law: choosing<lb/>
rather to be compelled (against his will) to admit them by<lb/>
Law, then voluntarily to <normalised orig="doe" auto="false">do</normalised> that which his conscience<lb/>
made scruple of. And for the livings and other <notvariant>preferments</notvariant>,<lb/>
which fell in his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> gift, he ever bestowed them<lb/>
freely (as you have <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> before) upon deserving men,<lb/>
without suit: So that we may say of him as was said long<lb/>
since, concerning Robert <notvariant>Winchelsey</notvariant>, Archbishop of Canterbury.<lb/>

Thirdly, The last was <normalised orig="Sacriledge" auto="true">Sacrilege</normalised>, which he did so much<lb/>
<normalised orig="abhorre" auto="true">abhor</normalised>, that when the <normalised orig="Bishopricke" auto="false">Bishopric</normalised> of <notvariant>Sarum</notvariant>, and that of<lb/>

Concerning that of Salisbury, give leave to <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised> a <normalised orig="particuler" auto="true">particular</normalised><lb/>
passage of his, which happened many <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> after his said<lb/>
<normalised orig="refusall" auto="true">refusal</normalised> of it, which was this; At a Parliament under King<lb/>
James, when an Act was to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised>, concerning <notvariant>Sherburne</notvariant><lb/>
Castle, it was observed, that <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> Bishop <notvariant>Andrewes</notvariant> and<lb/>
another gave their Votes against the same. That the other<lb/>
should so <normalised orig="doe" auto="false">do</normalised> was not much <normalised orig="merveiled" auto="false">marveled</normalised> at, but that Bishop<lb/>
<notvariant>Andrewes</notvariant> should <normalised orig="doe" auto="false">do</normalised> it, when none but that other Lord did<lb/>
so, was so <normalised orig="remarkeable" auto="true">remarkable</normalised>, as that he was demanded by a great<lb/>
Person, what his reason was for it. To which he most worthily<lb/>
<normalised orig="replyed" auto="true">replied</normalised>, that it could not be well <normalised orig="wondred" auto="true">wondered</normalised>, why he<lb/>
should now vote against that which if he would have <normalised orig="yeelded" auto="true">yielded</normalised><lb/>
unto (many <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> before, in the <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> of <normalised orig="Queene" auto="true">Queen</normalised> Elizabeth)<lb/>
he might have had this <normalised orig="Bishopricke" auto="false">Bishopric</normalised> of <notvariant>Sarum</notvariant>: which<lb/>
reason of his, when his late Majesty (being then Prince,<lb/>
and present at the passing of the Act) heard; He <notvariant>beshrewed</notvariant><lb/>
him, that when he <normalised orig="denyed" auto="true">denied</normalised> his consent, he did not declare<lb/>
the reason of his <normalised orig="denyall" auto="true">denial</normalised> also: Professing that had he <normalised orig="bin" auto="false">been</normalised><lb/>
made acquainted with the state of that Case, as now he<lb/>
was, (he would with the King his Fathers good leave)<lb/>
have <normalised orig="labored" auto="true">laboured</normalised> against the passing of the said Act. To close<lb/>
up this point: This reverend Prelate went yet a degree further,<lb/>
in refusing (when he was Bishop of Winchester (diverse<lb/>
large and considerable <normalised orig="summes" auto="true">sums</normalised>, to renew some Leases, because<lb/>
he conceived that the renewing of them might be<lb/>
<normalised orig="prejudiciall" auto="true">prejudicial</normalised> to Succession.<lb/>
Now let us lay all these together: His <normalised orig="Zeale" auto="true">Zeal</normalised> and Piety:<lb/>
His Charity, and Compassion: His Fidelity, and Integrity:<lb/>
His Gratitude, and <normalised orig="Thankfulnesse" auto="true">Thankfulness</normalised>: His Munificence and<lb/>
Bounty: Hospitality, Humanity, Affability, and Modesty:<lb/>

them <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> in this <normalised orig="Compend" auto="true">Compendium</normalised>) we have seen in him, as<lb/>

in particular, did not suffer an irreparable <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised>, by his<lb/>
death.<lb/>
Having taken a short survey of his Life, let us now see<lb/>
him Dying. He was not often <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised>, and but once (till his<lb/>
last <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised>) in thirty <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised>, before the time he <normalised orig="dyed" auto="false">died</normalised>, which<lb/>
was at <notvariant>Downham</notvariant> in the Isle of Ely, the <normalised orig="ayre" auto="false">air</normalised> of that place<lb/>
not agreeing with the constitution of his body. But there<lb/>
he seemed to be prepared for his dissolution; saying oftentimes<lb/>
in that <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised>, It must come once, and why not<lb/>
here? And at other times, before and since, he would say,<lb/>
The <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> must come, when, whether we will or <notvariant>nill</notvariant>, we<lb/>
shall say (with the Preacher) <quote type="biblical" ana="Eccl 12.1">I have no pleasure in them</quote>,<notvariant>Eccl</notvariant>.<lb/>
12.1. Of his Death he seemed to presage <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> a <normalised orig="yeere" auto="true">year</normalised><lb/>
before he <normalised orig="dyed" auto="false">died</normalised>, and therefore prepared his <normalised orig="oyle" auto="true">oil</normalised>, that he<lb/>
might be admitted in due time into the Bride Chamber.<lb/>
That of <notvariant>qualis</notvariant> <notvariant>vita</notvariant>, &amp;c. was truly verified in him; for as he<lb/>
lived, so <normalised orig="dyed" auto="false">died</normalised> he. As his fidelity in his health was great,<lb/>
so <normalised orig="encreased" auto="true">increased</normalised> the strength of his Faith in his <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised>. His<lb/>
Gratitude to men, was now changed into his <normalised orig="Thankfulnesse" auto="true">Thankfulness</normalised><lb/>
to God. His Affability to incessant and devout Prayers<lb/>
and speech with his Creator, Redeemer and <notvariant>Sanctifier</notvariant>.<lb/>
His laborious Studies, to his <normalised orig="restlesse" auto="true">restless</normalised> <normalised orig="groanes" auto="true">groans</normalised>, <normalised orig="sighes" auto="true">sighs</normalised>, <normalised orig="cryes" auto="true">cries</normalised><lb/>
