NARRATIVE,<lb/>
Wherein is related how<lb/>
this Child was visited, and the manner<lb/>
of her Disease, when she did utter<lb/>
those Heaven born Truths<lb/>
herewith published.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
THis Child who <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> been the subject<lb/>
of such wonders of Providence,<lb/>
is the daughter of Master<lb/>
Anthony and <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Faith Hatfield<lb/>
of <notvariant>Leighton</notvariant> in the West-Riding of Yorkshire;<lb/>
her name is Martha Hatfield: she<lb/>
was <normalised orig="compleat" auto="true">complete</normalised> twelve years old the 27 day of<lb/>
September, in the year of our Lord 1652.<lb/>
She <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> been from her birth a <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> of<lb/>
wonders, being so <normalised orig="litle" auto="true">little</normalised> when she was brought<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="2">C</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
out of her mothers <normalised orig="wombe" auto="true">womb</normalised>; that it was<lb/>
thought she would speedily have returned to<lb/>
the common <normalised orig="wombe" auto="true">womb</normalised>, where all living must<lb/>
ere long be laid up. But God who <normalised orig="quickneth" auto="false">quickened</normalised><lb/>
the dead, who is the preserver of man, continued<lb/>
her life, and she grew up very hopefully,<lb/>
as a plant of Gods own planting, yet<lb/>
some years before this visitation, she was observed<lb/>
to be of a sad spirit, oft retiring into<lb/>
corners, and weeping for a long time, and<lb/>
could not then render any reason thereof;<lb/>
but it evidently appeared <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterwards</normalised>, that she<lb/>
was much afflicted with the <notvariant>spleen-winde</notvariant>,<lb/>
which <normalised orig="encreased" auto="true">increased</normalised> (notwithstanding the use<lb/>
of means) to greater extremity.<lb/>
But before I proceed, I must desire the<lb/>
Reader not to expect an exact Relation of<lb/>
her Disease in physical terms of art; because<lb/>
it pleased the all-wise <notvariant>Disposer</notvariant> of all occurrences<lb/>
so to order the spirit of the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, and<lb/>
his own dealings towards her, (as you may<lb/>
see anon) that no means could be used towards<lb/>
her recovery, and so no Physicians did<lb/>
stay with her to observe the <normalised orig="symptomes" auto="true">symptoms</normalised> of<lb/>
her disease; so that it's but conjectural what it<lb/>
was; it's thought the rigid convulsions, or<lb/>
rather that it was a complicated disease of<lb/>
many of those <notvariant>distempers</notvariant> which affect the<lb/>
brain; but I shall give it you in our <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised><lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="3">2</fw>

                  <lb/>
Dialect, as those that were usually with<lb/>
her did apprehend it.<lb/>
I shall observe this Method:<lb/>

3 The manner of her recovery.<lb/>

                  <lb/>
The <notvariant>Spleen-winde</notvariant> (after some time) did<lb/>
grow to that extremity, that she could not<lb/>
digest her meat, but vomited up all that she<lb/>
took, which yet was but a small quantity for<lb/>
a long time; after which she was taken all<lb/>
of one side, beginning at her neck, which<lb/>
caused her to hold her head awry; and from<lb/>
thence it went into her arm, and took away<lb/>
the use of it for many <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, and when her<lb/>
arm was better, it fell into her leg on the<lb/>
same side, and continued there until she fell<lb/>
quite down, which was after this manner.<lb/>
She had extraordinary fits of violent vomiting,<lb/>
and after that Convulsions, which occasioned<lb/>
<normalised orig="extream" auto="true">extreme</normalised> torments, especially in the<lb/>
night, and so she continued (sometimes better,<lb/>
sometimes worse) for many <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, sorely<lb/>
troubled with a stopping, &amp;c.<lb/>
In which time she had the use of her understanding,<lb/>
and could speak, and with many<lb/>
sweet words was able to exhort her parents<lb/>
to trust in God. Saying; If we had but<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="4">C2</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
faith, it would carry us thorough all the troubles<lb/>
of this world.<lb/>
Then about April the sixth, 1652, we<lb/>
perceived such a change in her, that we<lb/>
thought she would die presently, and she fell<lb/>
into a fit of <normalised orig="extream" auto="true">extreme</normalised> pain in her side, which<lb/>
took away her breath, and her senses for 16<lb/>
<normalised orig="houres" auto="true">hours</normalised>; and she was stricken all over stiff, in<lb/>
which time she lay (as if dead) <normalised orig="hopelesse" auto="true">hopeless</normalised> of<lb/>
life in the judgements of those who beheld<lb/>
her. Yet about the third <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> she was enabled<lb/>
with great alacrity to express the <normalised orig="joyes" auto="true">joys</normalised><lb/>
of Heaven, and sweetly prayed for herself<lb/>
and all her relations, as she conceived their<lb/>
necessities required.<lb/>
First, for her father thy <normalised orig="serva~t" auto="false">servant</normalised>, the head of this<lb/>
family, Lord, give him faith in Jesus Christ<lb/>
to lay hold upon thee, and give him patience<lb/>
to be contented with thy will; and for our<lb/>
mother who <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> been so long weak, Lord,<lb/>
restore her, and make her a comfort to us all,<lb/>
and teach her to submit to thy will; and for<lb/>
my Grand-mother that old stock, that old<lb/>
stock, that thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> made such a comfort<lb/>
to us, good Lord, we thank thee for her,<lb/>
and if I live, I desire to be thankful for her.<lb/>
And for our brother who is to be disposed of,<lb/>
good Lord, direct the heart of thy servant<lb/>
our father to dispose of him as may be most<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="5">4</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
for thy glory, and for the good of his soul<lb/>
and body.<lb/>
Good Lord, bless our sister who <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> taken<lb/>
so great pains with my mother and me;<lb/>
and our other little brother, Lord, make him<lb/>
thine, and guide him in all his <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> in his<lb/>
young <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised>, that his soul may be precious in<lb/>
thy sight; and my other sister the Lord<lb/>
give her grace. And that other little sister,<lb/>
good Lord, take away that infirmity from her<lb/>
eye, if it be thy will. And for that sister whom<lb/>
thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> disposed of in marriage, the Lord<lb/>
bless that family, and give them more and<lb/>
more of thy Spirit to guide them in thy<lb/>
<normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised>; and, Lord, give him a Spirit of prayer,<lb/>
but let us not make haste, for thy time is the<lb/>
best. And for that little branch, Lord, as it<lb/>
grows in days &amp; years, grant that it may grow<lb/>
in grace, and walk in thy way. And for that<lb/>
godly sweet servant of thine (that prayed<lb/>
so heartily for me the last night) the Lord<lb/>
bless him; and, Lord, bless thy servant, who is<lb/>
gone to use means for her health, and bless<lb/>
the means, for without thy <choice ana="print">
                     <sic><notvariant>bessing</notvariant></sic>
                     <corr>blessing</corr>
                  </choice> nothing<lb/>
can profit; and, Lord, if it be for thy glory<lb/>
bring them together, and if not, make them<lb/>
contented to yield to thy will. Good Lord,<lb/>
bless all our Family, and make them thine<lb/>
and teach all our friends to walk in thy<lb/>
<normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised>.<lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
When she began this prayer, all about her<lb/>
were so amazed with the suddenness of it,<lb/>
that they could not (for the joy and astonishment<lb/>
wherewith their spirits were filled) observe<lb/>
each passage so exactly as is desired<lb/>
they had done, so that many of her expressions<lb/>
are lost; but these things set down are<lb/>
(as <normalised orig="neer" auto="true">near</normalised> as they that were present could recall<lb/>
to their thoughts) related and written<lb/>
down in her own very words.<lb/>
After this prayer her head fell, and she<lb/>
was as in a trance, and as she past into it she<lb/>
said, The Lord be with you all, I am now going<lb/>
to Heaven, where I hope one day you<lb/>
will come to me. And when she was come<lb/>
forth of that trance, in which they thought<lb/>
she would have died, she was exceedingly<lb/>
rapt up with joy (which perhaps was the<lb/>
Heaven she <normalised orig="spake" auto="false">spoke</normalised> of, that she was going to)<lb/>
laughing, and spreading her arms, and clasping<lb/>
them close to her, that they could not<lb/>
be opened; but presently she opened them,<lb/>
and <normalised orig="exprest" auto="true">expressed</normalised> herself in these words.<lb/>
I have found my Christ, <normalised orig="ô" auto="false">oh</normalised>, I have found my<lb/>
Christ, how sweet is he to me!<lb/>
After this fit of joy, she fell into a sore<lb/>
conflict with Satan, and opening her arms<lb/>
which were clasped with hugging her sweet<lb/>
Christ unto her, she struck so vehemently as<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="7">6</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
if she had more then ordinary strength, and<lb/>
<normalised orig="exprest" auto="true">expressed</normalised> her self in these words.<lb/>
Away, away, away Satan, with a stern<lb/>
countenance (which was a great change in her<lb/>
face, which was so amiable before in her <normalised orig="rejoycing" auto="true">rejoicing</normalised><lb/>
of it) and so she continued for some<lb/>
time, and then the Lord was pleased to give<lb/>
her comfort again.<lb/>
And then she laughed, and <normalised orig="rejoyced" auto="true">rejoiced</normalised> much<lb/>
more then before, and spread her arms, and<lb/>
clasped them close again, and said; O, my<lb/>
Christ is come again, my Christ is come again;<lb/>
he shall vanquish Satan, and cast him <normalised orig="behinde" auto="true">behind</normalised><lb/>
me.<lb/>
Then she fell again into another conflict,<lb/>
with striking as before, but never <normalised orig="spake" auto="false">spoke</normalised> in a<lb/>
conflict; but the conflict being over, she <normalised orig="spake" auto="false">spoke</normalised>,<lb/>
and <normalised orig="laught" auto="true">laughed</normalised>, and behaved her self in the like<lb/>
manner as before.<lb/>
O, now my sweet Christ is come again, he is<lb/>
come again, and <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> destroyed my <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> enemy,<lb/>
who would have destroyed my soul. O labour<lb/>
for Christ, and that the Name of Christ may be<lb/>
written upon all your hearts with letters of<lb/>
gold.<lb/>
Thus one time with comforts, and at other<lb/>
times with conflicts, she continued the greatest<lb/>
part of one night (which they that were<lb/>
present thought, was about the several times<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="8">7</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
that night, but they were all so astonished<lb/>
both with the matter and manner, that they<lb/>
could not certainly relate how many of those<lb/>
conflicts and comfortable fits she had; neither<lb/>
indeed (as they acknowledge) are they<lb/>
able to relate the manner thereof, as it was<lb/>
made known unto them.<lb/>
After this about 17 <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, she lay stiff and<lb/>
never <normalised orig="spake" auto="false">spoke</normalised> all that time, and it pleased the<lb/>
Lord so to order her disease, that she came to<lb/>
her self twice a day: viz. at twelve a clock at<lb/>
noon-day, and six at night, and then she did<lb/>
understand herself, but could not speak, and<lb/>
to these times she kept constantly for about<lb/>
17 <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, and then she would make <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> to<lb/>
wash her mouth with small beer or water,<lb/>
they not knowing what she would have, but<lb/>
she could manifest dislike of what was offered;<lb/>
if it was not that which she desired; she<lb/>
took no food all this time, but <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <normalised orig="washt" auto="true">washed</normalised><lb/>
her mouth (as was said) twice a day.<lb/>
About this time coming to her self, she<lb/>
fell into great extremity of vomiting for two<lb/>
<normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, and that which she vomited was like<lb/>
gall or soot, and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>, and by times continued<lb/>
in that extremity for seven or eight<lb/>
<normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, and was carried about in the arms of<lb/>
one or other, or sate on their knees having<lb/>
little rest, save some short <notvariant>Dormes</notvariant>; she <normalised orig="spake" auto="false">spoke</normalised><lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="9">8</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
much and uttered many sweet expressions.<lb/>
Many times being desired to take some<lb/>
food, she answered; I would take food if<lb/>
God would give me leave, but I cannot, I<lb/>
cannot; and when they would do any thing<lb/>
about her (if it might be) to give her some<lb/>
ease, she would say, Alas, here's no ease<lb/>
here, O that you will not suffer a poor creature<lb/>
to have some ease! there's no comfort<lb/>
to be had here, but there's ease in Heaven.<lb/>
At another time, she said, O Lord, some<lb/>
ease for a poor distressed creature; Lord, for<lb/>
thy Son Christ his sake.<lb/>
Again, <notvariant>Where's</notvariant> my father and my mother,<lb/>
that they may pray for me? I had a father<lb/>
and a mother, and brethren and sisters.<lb/>
Again, she was much troubled, and said,<lb/>
What a naughty, naughty Lass was I, to be<lb/>
so impatient? but now I have more pain, and<lb/>
the Lord <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> given me more patience; now<lb/>
I can say with David, <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 119.71">It is good for me that I<lb/>
have been afflicted</quote>. Good? It is good indeed, for<lb/>
my father <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> got good, and my mother<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> got good, and I have got good, and<lb/>
God <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> got glory. I would not have been<lb/>
without this affliction for any thing; this is<lb/>
a good affliction indeed.<lb/>

vanities thereof; if we could but feel one<lb/>
dram of the <normalised orig="sweetnesse" auto="true">sweetness</normalised> of Christ, we should<lb/>
not give way to the vanities of the world as<lb/>
we do; but while we are in the flesh, we<lb/>
are apt to follow the lusts of the flesh; if<lb/>
we could be so sensible of the <normalised orig="sweetnesse" auto="true">sweetness</normalised> of<lb/>
Christ, and apprehend it aright, we should<lb/>
be taken up so with Christ, and with the<lb/>
<normalised orig="sweetnesse" auto="true">sweetness</normalised> of him, that we should not be<lb/>
so carried away with the vanities of the<lb/>
world, but we should give up our selves to<lb/>

She had great extremity of pain, and, as<lb/>
conceived, would gladly have spoken, making<lb/>
<normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> that her heart was in Heaven,<lb/>
(as was thought by those who were present<lb/>
with her) for she pulled at her <normalised orig="brest" auto="true">breast</normalised> <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised><lb/>
times, and held up her hand as high<lb/>
as she could reach, looking up with her<lb/>
eyes; and then, after a short space, she <normalised orig="spake" auto="false">spoke</normalised>,<lb/>
and said,<lb/>
Me is not in the hand of mine enemy, but<lb/>
in the hand of my loving Father; he is an<lb/>
ever-living, ever-loving and glorious Lord<lb/>
God, he is a wise God, and he will not give<lb/>
his children one lash more than he sees good<lb/>
for them.<lb/>
After this she <normalised orig="spake" auto="false">spoke</normalised> no more until the<lb/>
eighth day of December, which was the day<lb/>
after the Lord had graciously given her<lb/>
the use of her Senses and of her Understanding.<lb/>
To close up this second part of the Narrative,<lb/>
I shall <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised> this, that some of these<lb/>
Speeches she uttered, (though but few of<lb/>
them will need such <normalised orig="Apologie" auto="true">Apology</normalised>) in <normalised orig="weaknesse" auto="true">weakness</normalised>,<lb/>
as a <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> under such strange <notvariant>distempers</notvariant>, as<lb/>
did <normalised orig="somwhat" auto="true">somewhat</normalised> confuse and <normalised orig="perturbe" auto="true">perturb</normalised> her intellectuals;<lb/>

                  <lb/>
but other things she uttered <normalised orig="thorow" auto="true">thorough</normalised><lb/>
the strength of the Spirits assistance extraordinarily<lb/>
guiding her tongue to utter<lb/>
such things, as now she cannot tell that ever<lb/>
she did speak them. There be some things<lb/>
oft repeated; yet because either they are uttered<lb/>
with some variety, and were things that<lb/>
it seems her heart was much carried forth to<lb/>
mention; therefore I have set them down,<lb/>
and hope they will not be tedious, but may<lb/>
raise up further thoughts of them, when you<lb/>
read them over again, and compare them<lb/>
with the Scripture in the Margin; and if<lb/>
you knew the state of the family, and the<lb/>
condition of some that came occasionally<lb/>
to hear her, you would say, there was a Divine<lb/>
hand that guided her tongue, and that<lb/>
God was with her mouth, adapting her<lb/>
speeches to their necessities.<lb/>
And I suppose her heart was more affected<lb/>
with some truths before this ill fit, and of<lb/>
those things she makes the most frequent<lb/>
mention: But <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> I am Apologizing for<lb/>
her Repetitions, some may tax me for Omissions:<lb/>
some have said, that she prophesied,<lb/>
and no such passages are here related; to<lb/>
which I answer, there is no ground for such<lb/>
a report: there is one passage related in one<lb/>
of her Speeches, October the 19th. (in the end<lb/>

<normalised orig="fancie" auto="true">fancy</normalised> this to be a <normalised orig="Prophetick" auto="true">Prophetic</normalised> foretelling of<lb/>
her Recovery, I know not any thing uttered<lb/>
by her, nor could upon enquiry hear of any<lb/>
thing that might give ground for such a report;<lb/>
but the truth is, such Reporters (I<lb/>
hear) do some of them expect to have the<lb/>
gift of Miracles, and it may be of prophesying,<lb/>
and seemed to be much taken with<lb/>
Gods dispensations to this <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised>, hoping it<lb/>
would have conduced something to the promoting<lb/>
of their cause, but are disappointed;<lb/>
for God <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> opened the mouth of a dumb<lb/>
<normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> to confute their follies. It may be<lb/>
they prophesied that she would <normalised orig="prophesie" auto="true">prophecy</normalised>,<lb/>
and so have proved themselves to be false<lb/>
prophets.<lb/>
My hearts desire and prayer to God shall<lb/>
be, that these Speeches may take as deep impression<lb/>
upon the hearts of the Readers, as<lb/>
they did upon her body, who was the Speaker:<lb/>
God was pleased to hold her upon the<lb/>
rack for so many weeks, nay <normalised orig="moneths" auto="true">months</normalised>, in<lb/>
which she endured grievous <notvariant>torturings</notvariant>; and<lb/>
yet to enable her to speak such things, surely<lb/>

MAny <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> had been set apart in the<lb/>

God, on the <normalised orig="behalfe" auto="true">behalf</normalised> of this afflicted <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised>;<lb/>
which Duties her parents, (as <notvariant>Obed-Edom</notvariant> the<lb/>
Ark) were forward to entertain (as at other<lb/>
times, so) now in this their afflicted condition.<lb/>
They have had much experience that<lb/>
God was a God hearing prayer; and therefore<lb/>
would not be beaten off from these (now<lb/>
alas, too much neglected) <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised>, from<lb/>
which they had sucked much <normalised orig="sweetnesse" auto="true">sweetness</normalised>, having<lb/>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>

power of his might,</quote> but <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> <quote type="biblical" ana="Dan 11.34">helping them<lb/>

able to bear so many as came to seek God in<lb/>
those duties: he replied, The more, the better,<lb/>
so that those who come, can pray and<lb/>
believe.<lb/>
But yet the Lord in <normalised orig="wisdome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised> seemed to us<lb/>
to be <quote type="biblical" ana="Jer 14.9">as one astonished, as a mighty man that<lb/>
cannot save</quote>, the Childes <notvariant>distempers</notvariant> of body<lb/>
growing more violent, she having most terrible<lb/>
crying fits, (by reason of her <normalised orig="extream" auto="true">extreme</normalised><lb/>

blood, and then she was quiet) which<lb/>
were very grievous and <normalised orig="afflictive" auto="false">afflicted</normalised> to the spirits<lb/>

                  <lb/>
Which dealings of the Lord with that<lb/>
family did serve to awaken them to a more<lb/>
solemn way of seeking his face, and it was<lb/>
judged, that it was his purpose to have his<lb/>
providential dispensations in relation to this<lb/>

                  <lb/>

might behold his glorious goings, and<lb/>
bear <normalised orig="witnesse" auto="true">witness</normalised> thereof unto the world, when<lb/>
he should finish his work upon her: therefore<lb/>
her Parents did write and speak to <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised><lb/>
Ministers of his Word, (two of which<lb/>
have prefixed Epistles to this Narrative) and<lb/>
a Day was fixed to be set apart for Humiliation,<lb/>
of which many precious servants of<lb/>
God had notice, which was the ninth day of<lb/>
November: In which Day the Company<lb/>
being met at Mr. <notvariant>Hatfeilds</notvariant> house, and the<lb/>
work entered on, but the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> was observed<lb/>
by such as did attend her to be somewhat<lb/>
<notvariant>unquiet</notvariant>; the reason whereof they<lb/>
knew not, <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> a thought came in, that if<lb/>
she were brought into the Room where the<lb/>
Company was assembled, that then she<lb/>
might possibly be quieter; wherefore her<lb/>
Maid brought her in her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised>, where she<lb/>
continued quietly all the time we were at<lb/>
the duty, not once interrupting us, and the<lb/>
eye did serve to affect the heart, and to <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised><lb/>
them to <normalised orig="wrastle" auto="true">wrestle</normalised> with God more affectionately;<lb/>
this passage is the more wonderful;<lb/>
because (so <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> as could be rationally judged)<lb/>
she did neither hear or see or know any<lb/>
body; and so we know not how she should<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="140">139</fw>
                  <pb n="16"/>
                  <lb/>
understand that there was such a work in<lb/>
hand, <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> the Lord should hint it to her,<lb/>
(as he did many of her Speeches, if not all)<lb/>
and indeed, some of her Speeches the night<lb/>
before and night after the Duty was concluded,<lb/>
do import such a thing. See her<lb/>
Speeches November the eighth, where she<lb/>
quotes that <notvariant>Psal</notvariant>. 50. 15. and suitably to that<lb/>
she added after: Oh let us cry aloud unto the<lb/>
Lord in the time of necessity, and he <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised><lb/>
promised to give ear to us; which word<lb/>
did strongly call upon us to cry mightily unto<lb/>
the Lord: there are many other passages<lb/>
that night, which I refer the Reader to, and<lb/>
we took them as messages sent from Heaven<lb/>
to quicken our hearts in the duty; there was<lb/>
one passage that night, viz. her fourth speech<lb/>
about repentance and faith; whereby she<lb/>
did direct us how to order our Humiliations<lb/>
as desiring they might be <normalised orig="Evangelicall" auto="false">Evangelical</normalised>, not<lb/>
<normalised orig="legall" auto="true">legal</normalised>; the fruits of faith, not of slavish<lb/>
<normalised orig="feares" auto="true">fears</normalised>: she would have us look on Christ,<lb/>
and then mourn; believe, and then repent;<lb/>
and when the duty was concluded November<lb/>
the ninth, at her <normalised orig="usuall" auto="true">usual</normalised> time she uttered<lb/>
<normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> passages, wherein we might observe<lb/>
God exceedingly ordering of her words, as<lb/>
the first speech that night, and the fourth,<lb/>
and the seventh, and especially the ninth,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="141">140</fw>
                  <pb n="17"/>
                  <lb/>
which was an admirable caution given in to<lb/>
us.<lb/>
Now to return, that which was (in relation<lb/>
to the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>) set upon our hearts particularly<lb/>
to ask of God, was this, that he<lb/>
would please to quiet her spirit, ease her of<lb/>
her pain, so that the <normalised orig="eares" auto="true">ears</normalised> of her dear relations<lb/>
might not be filled with such <normalised orig="dolefull" auto="true">doleful</normalised><lb/>
cries, nor their hearts with those fears and<lb/>
<notvariant>amazements</notvariant>, whereby they were much unfitted<lb/>
to act Faith, or do any duty to God<lb/>
of man; <choice ana="print">
                     <sic><notvariant>extram</notvariant></sic>

in this the Lord was pleased graciously to<lb/>
answer the desires of his poor Servants<lb/>
through the Intercession of the Lord Jesus<lb/>
Christ, which we had notice of at our next<lb/>
meeting, and did desire to improve it, taking<lb/>
it as a pledge that God would do more<lb/>
for us, and own us in our Attendances upon<lb/>
him in his own way.<lb/>
At the end of that day of Humiliation a<lb/>
Motion was made, that we might continue<lb/>
once a <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised> (at least) to seek God <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised><lb/>
he should be pleased to come with <quote type="biblical" ana="Mal 4.2">healing<lb/>
under his wings.</quote> Those that were engaged<lb/>
in that work living at a great distance<lb/>
from one another, we could not well meet<lb/>
oftener then once a <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised>, and with that<lb/>
                  <pb n="18"/>
                  <lb/>
resolution we parted, waiting to see what<lb/>
the Lord would do for his Servants in that<lb/>
Family, whose condition God did very much<lb/>
assist those who were engaged in that Duty<lb/>
to bear upon their hearts continually, with<lb/>
much <normalised orig="tendernesse" auto="true">tenderness</normalised>. The time appointed for<lb/>
the next day of Humiliation was, as I remember;<lb/>
the 9 day of December next ensuing.<lb/>
But the Lord ordered things so, that the<lb/>
<normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> grew exceeding weak, not being able<lb/>
to speak from the 21 of November, any more,<lb/>
(as was before noted,) so that her friends did<lb/>
think that God was <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> to finish his<lb/>
work, and her time of warfare here in the<lb/>
body.<lb/>
Wherefore her father <normalised orig="dispatcht" auto="false">dispatched</normalised> messages to<lb/>
the Ministers and Christians to meet &amp; keep<lb/>
a day of Humiliation, on Thursday, the second<lb/>
of December, (a week sooner then we thought<lb/>
of) and accordingly we met on that day, and<lb/>
found her very weak, (so that she was not<lb/>
brought into the room, where we performed<lb/>
the Duties of the day:) That which (amongst<lb/>
other things, as particularly relating<lb/>
to her) was desired of God, was, that God<lb/>
would manifest his power in enabling her to<lb/>
speak again, that so, <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> she lived, she<lb/>
might be <normalised orig="usefull" auto="true">useful</normalised> and <normalised orig="instrumentall" auto="true">instrumental</normalised> for his<lb/>

them:) God was also very earnestly <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised><lb/>
(with many arguments which his Spirit suggested)<lb/>
to raise her up, that he, perfecting his<lb/>
work, might have perfect praises; and his<lb/>
work might be cleared to the conviction of<lb/>
slanderous tongues, and the further comfort<lb/>
and satisfaction of the hearts of his people;<lb/>
the day being finished, we departed to<lb/>
our Homes, desiring to submit, and wait the<lb/>
Lords <normalised orig="leasure" auto="true">leisure</normalised>, and (if she lived) to continue<lb/>
seeking of him. But, behold, God was better<lb/>
to us then we could think, and when we<lb/>
had scarce faith to believe what he had (in<lb/>
some measure) set our hearts a work to ask<lb/>
(upon the ninth of December, the Day which<lb/>
formerly, as I noted, we had agreed together<lb/>

she knew her youngest sister, being about<lb/>
4 years of age, who used to lie by her, and be<lb/>
very fond of her, and would be oftentimes<lb/>
kissing of her; and soon after she knew her<lb/>
Mother, and <normalised orig="rejoyced" auto="true">rejoiced</normalised> to see her with laughing<lb/>
and <normalised orig="stroaking" auto="true">stroking</normalised> of her face, and clasping<lb/>
her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> about her neck; and then her Father<lb/>
came, and asked her, if she knew him,<lb/>
and after a while (for her eyes were yet<lb/>
somewhat dim) she did the like to him, holding<lb/>
up her hands together, as if she would<lb/>
desire him to pray for her, &amp; she did the like<lb/>
to her Mother. And we plainly discovered<lb/>
that God had restored at that instant the<lb/>
senses of Hearing, Seeing, Smelling and<lb/>
Handling, for when we called her by her<lb/>
name, she had an expression, whereby we<lb/>
perceived she heard us, as also that she saw<lb/>
us, and there was a pair of sweet Gloves, and<lb/>
we <normalised orig="bad" auto="false">bade</normalised> her smell at them, and she put them<lb/>
to her Nose several times; and she had at<lb/>
that time much use of her hands, which she<lb/>
had not before. And her Mother came to<lb/>
her again, &amp; said, What <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> the Lord done<lb/>
for thee? art thou not willing to give God<lb/>
all that he <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> given thee, thy Life, Understanding,<lb/>
and all thy Senses, and Heart, and<lb/>
all? and she manifested her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> by <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised>,<lb/>
that she was cheerfully willing so to do, by<lb/>

holding up her hands, and lifting up her eyes<lb/>
   with smiling, and plucking at her heart diverse<lb/>
times, and then lifted up her hand as<lb/>
high as she could reach, as though she would<lb/>
give God her heart, and all; and about nine<lb/>
   a clock she knew her sister Hannah, and her<lb/>
   Grand-Mother, the Wife of Mr. George<lb/>
   <notvariant>Westby</notvariant>, a Gentleman well known in the<lb/>
   North and South, (a very godly Gentlewoman)<lb/>
   and she did express the same by laughing<lb/>
   and stroking their faces, and closing of<lb/>
   her hands to her Grandmother, as if she desired<lb/>
   her to pray for her.<lb/>
   Then she went to bed, and God gave her<lb/>
   reasonable good rest and sleep; that next<lb/>
   morning, being the eighth of December, she<lb/>
   had four or five sick fits, her body, face and<lb/>
   lips being very much swelled; but when she<lb/>
   was better, the swelling did fall again at an<lb/>
   instant, and then <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> she held up her<lb/>
   hands and eyes, seeming to praise God, and<lb/>
   all the afternoon she played with some <normalised orig="odde" auto="true">odd</normalised><lb/>
   toys, and Spice, which Neighbours had<lb/>
   brought her, which she had in a little Basket<lb/>
   <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> betwixt five and six a clock at night,<lb/>
   and then she fell into a <normalised orig="stiffe" auto="true">stiff</normalised> fit, yet without<lb/>
   any appearance of the Convulsions before,<lb/>
   (as it had been formerly with her) and then<lb/>
   she <normalised orig="spake" auto="false">spoke</normalised>, as she used to do in a <normalised orig="stiffe" auto="true">stiff</normalised> fit, and<lb/>
   said,<lb/>
