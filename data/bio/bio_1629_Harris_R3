                  <lb/>
First, then be thou pleased to take notice, that this<lb/>
holy man <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="noursed" auto="true">nursed</normalised> <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> from his tender age<lb/>
in the exercises of true <normalised orig="Pietie" auto="true">Piety</normalised>, and in the studies of various<lb/>
and exquisite Learning (first, in the famous<lb/>
<normalised orig="Schoole" auto="true">School</normalised> of Winchester, where he was placed a child,<lb/>
and after in New <normalised orig="Colledge" auto="true">College</normalised> in Oxford, whether<lb/>
he was elected to <normalised orig="bee" auto="false">be</normalised> a fellow) was in his riper <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="aduanced" auto="true">advanced</normalised> to <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> eminent places of <normalised orig="dignitie" auto="true">dignity</normalised> in the<lb/>
Church, not by any ambitious suit or seeking of his own;<lb/>
but by the <normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised>, and I had almost said; immediate<lb/>
<normalised orig="prouidence" auto="true">providence</normalised> of <normalised orig="Almightie" auto="true">Almighty</normalised> God, who beyond his expectation<lb/>
or desire, raised him by insensible degrees to the<lb/>
<normalised orig="heighth" auto="true">height</normalised> of <normalised orig="Episcopall" auto="true">Episcopal</normalised> <normalised orig="dignitie" auto="true">dignity</normalised>: thereby <normalised orig="giuing" auto="true">giving</normalised> <normalised orig="vs" auto="false">us</normalised> one<lb/>
<normalised orig="proofe" auto="true">proof</normalised> among many, that notwithstanding our great<lb/>
and manifold <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised> he <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> not altogether abandoned<lb/>
the care of this Church. For while this man by the <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised><lb/>
inclination and bent of his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>, affected<lb/>
rather the <normalised orig="fruitfulnesse" auto="true">fruitfulness</normalised> of the Vine , and the <normalised orig="fatnesse" auto="true">fatness</normalised><lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Oliue" auto="true">Olive</normalised>, in a more <normalised orig="priuate" auto="true">private</normalised> and retired life<lb/>
then to be a <normalised orig="Gouernour" auto="true">Governor</normalised> <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> the trees; as appeared by<lb/>
his willing acceptance of a Fellowship in the <normalised orig="Colledge" auto="true">College</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="neare" auto="true">near</normalised> Winchester, where for a time he <normalised orig="liued" auto="true">lived</normalised>, and<lb/>
could <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> contented to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> ended his <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised><lb/>
there in sweet contemplation if he had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> let alone.<lb/>
Yet God, that rules all things, so disposed of him, that<lb/>
one while by the conspiring votes of a numerous Society<lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> was, <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> before he thought of it, recalled to the<lb/>
<notvariant>Wardenship</notvariant> of that <normalised orig="Colledge" auto="true">College</normalised> whereof he had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised><lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
formerly fellow: another while by the <normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised> grace<lb/>
and <normalised orig="fauour" auto="true">favour</normalised> of his <normalised orig="Maiestie" auto="true">Majesty</normalised>, without any suite of his<lb/>
<normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> likewise, preferred first to the Prefecture of the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Hospitall" auto="true">Hospital</normalised> of Saint Crosses <normalised orig="neare" auto="true">near</normalised> Winchester, then<lb/>
to the <normalised orig="Deanerie" auto="true">Deanery</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Cathedrall" auto="true">Cathedral</normalised> Church of Worcester,<lb/>
and lastly to the <normalised orig="Bishopricke" auto="true">Bishopric</normalised> of Bath and <notvariant>Wels</notvariant>,<lb/>
where he died.<lb/>
In all which places of honour and employment,<lb/>
first, he <normalised orig="forgate" auto="true">forgot</normalised> not the practice of those <normalised orig="vertues" auto="true">virtues</normalised>, whereof<lb/>
he had made <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> in his more <normalised orig="priuate" auto="true">private</normalised> life, but continued<lb/>
the same in his <notvariant>Rotchet</notvariant>, which he had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> in his<lb/>
<normalised orig="Schollers" auto="false">Scholar's</normalised> <normalised orig="gowne" auto="true">gown</normalised>; thereby <normalised orig="shewing" auto="true">showing</normalised> that his <normalised orig="vertues" auto="true">virtues</normalised> were<lb/>
<normalised orig="vertues" auto="true">virtues</normalised> indeed, and that <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised> them not as <notvariant>Stageplayers</notvariant><lb/>
<normalised orig="doe" auto="false">do</normalised> their <normalised orig="vizards" auto="false">wizards</normalised>, only to act a part in, which<lb/>
being done, they pull them off, and cast them into a<lb/>
corner.<lb/>
Instances of this kind may be, First, his <normalised orig="Humilitie" auto="true">Humility</normalised>,<lb/>
the Basis, as it is well called, of all <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised>, which<lb/>
being a fruit of true Christian mortification, and consisting<lb/>
in a low-prising of a mans <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, and his gifts, he<lb/>
had studied so well in his younger <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>, that in the<lb/>
whole course of his life, afterwards there was no <notvariant>tumor</notvariant><lb/>
of pride appeared, but as well in his actions as in his<lb/>
speeches, he <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> made <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> <normalised orig="equall" auto="true">equal</normalised> with those<lb/>
of the lowest sort. and that notwithstanding the many<lb/>
temptations which <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> had both from the <normalised orig="eminencie" auto="true">eminency</normalised><lb/>
of his place, and <normalised orig="excellencie" auto="true">excellency</normalised> of his parts to <normalised orig="doe" auto="false">do</normalised> and<lb/>
<normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> otherwise.<lb/>
Secondly, From this, and not from the <normalised orig="goodnesse" auto="true">goodness</normalised><lb/>
of his nature only, though that were very good, did<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
proceed that singular <normalised orig="Affabilitie" auto="true">Affability</normalised>, and <normalised orig="easinesse" auto="true">easiness</normalised> of<lb/>
<normalised orig="Accesse" auto="true">Access</normalised> which he <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> retained to all sorts of men, and<lb/>
to those of his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="Coate" auto="true">Coat</normalised> especially. There was no place<lb/>
nor time almost, except it were his times of <normalised orig="deuotion" auto="true">devotion</normalised>,<lb/>
wherein <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> might not <normalised orig="bee" auto="false">be</normalised> spoken with by the meanest<lb/>
person; and in his speech so <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> as lawfully he might,<lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> studied to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> the <normalised orig="partie" auto="true">party</normalised> content; so that although<lb/>
it were not in his power to grant <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> mans<lb/>
suite, (for who can <normalised orig="doe" auto="false">do</normalised> that?) yet I <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> no man<lb/>
can say, <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> was <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> <normalised orig="sleighted" auto="true">slighted</normalised> or <notvariant>superciliously</notvariant> <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised><lb/>
by him.<lb/>
 <normalised orig="Adde" auto="true">Add</normalised> <notvariant>hereunto</notvariant> his rare <normalised orig="Tranquillitie" auto="true">Tranquillity</normalised> and<lb/>
<normalised orig="Contentednesse" auto="false">Contentedness</normalised> of <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>: which though a man<lb/>
would <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> should agree best with an honourable<lb/>
and <normalised orig="plentifull" auto="true">plentiful</normalised> estate, yet experience <normalised orig="teacheth" auto="true">teaches</normalised>, that it<lb/>
is <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> otherwise. <normalised orig="Accesse" auto="true">Access</normalised> of fortunes in most men, rather<lb/>
<normalised orig="enlargeth" auto="true">enlarges</normalised> then <normalised orig="satisfieth" auto="true">satisfies</normalised> desire, and new honours<lb/>
breed new ambitions: besides the <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> employment of<lb/>
great men <normalised orig="occasioneth" auto="true">occasions</normalised> many troublesome &amp; disquieting<lb/>
thoughts which a <normalised orig="priuate" auto="true">private</normalised> life is naturally free from.<lb/>
But this man <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> first framed his mind to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> true<lb/>
contentment in his more <normalised orig="priuate" auto="true">private</normalised> fortunes, retained the<lb/>
same temper in all the alterations of his estate; so that<lb/>
<normalised orig="whatsoeuer" auto="true">whatsoever</normalised> outwardly befell him either to the better<lb/>
or the <normalised orig="worser" auto="false">worse</normalised> part, he seemed very little to be affected,<lb/>
surely nothing disquieted <normalised orig="therewithall" auto="true">therewithal</normalised>. A strange <normalised orig="serenitie" auto="true">serenity</normalised><lb/>
of <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> in him; whereof I take it also to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> a good argument, that (as I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> often heard<lb/>
him say) so long as he was in perfect health of his <normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>,<lb/>
he did <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="dreame" auto="true">dream</normalised>.<lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
 But a <normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised> cause of that also may <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> his great <normalised orig="Temperancie" auto="false">Temperance</normalised> or rather <normalised orig="Austeritie" auto="true">Austerity</normalised><lb/>
in diet, which was another <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> that <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> retained<lb/>
from the time he first tasted <normalised orig="Vniuersitie" auto="true">University</normalised> Commons <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised><lb/>
his dying day. For as at the greatest and best furnished<lb/>
<normalised orig="meales" auto="true">meals</normalised> whereat the condition of his place required<lb/>
his presence, his feeding was commonly <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> one dish,<lb/>
and that none of the daintiest; so it is well <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised>,<lb/>
that when he was not hindered by the <normalised orig="extraordinarie" auto="true">extraordinary</normalised><lb/>
resort of strangers <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> him, he fasted commonly <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised><lb/>
times in the <normalised orig="weeke" auto="true">week</normalised> from his supper, and spent that<lb/>
time <normalised orig="vntill" auto="true">until</normalised> eight or nine of the <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised> at night in framing<lb/>
some Meditation or other <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> a piece of holy<lb/>
Scripture, the copies of <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised> whereof remained in his<lb/>
<normalised orig="Studie" auto="true">Study</normalised> at his departure; some few of which thou shalt<lb/>
find annexed to this <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> for thy <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> and benefit.<lb/>
 As <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> was in his diet, so in his <normalised orig="apparell" auto="true">apparel</normalised>,<lb/>
recreations, and all other outward things belonging to<lb/>
this life a most sparing and temperate <normalised orig="vser" auto="true">user</normalised> of Gods<lb/>
blessings, and that as well in his richer as in his meaner<lb/>
fortunes: so that <normalised orig="vnlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> it were in the <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> of<lb/>
<normalised orig="schollers" auto="false">scholars</normalised>, and in such ingenious and pleasant discourses,<lb/>
as are incident thereto, (wherein he would sometimes<lb/>
<normalised orig="expresse" auto="true">express</normalised> much <normalised orig="freedome" auto="true">freedom</normalised> of innocent mirth) a man could<lb/>
not <normalised orig="obserue" auto="true">observe</normalised> that he <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> much delight in any <notvariant>wordly</notvariant><lb/>
thing <normalised orig="whatsoeuer" auto="true">whatsoever</normalised>; an <normalised orig="euident" auto="true">evident</normalised> argument, that his <normalised orig="intellectuall" auto="true">intellectual</normalised><lb/>
part had the <normalised orig="predominancy" auto="true">predominance</normalised> <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> his <normalised orig="sensuall" auto="true">sensual</normalised>,<lb/>
or rather indeed that grace ruled them both; and that<lb/>
the Man in him was subordinate to the Christian.<lb/>
With these <normalised orig="vertues" auto="true">virtues</normalised> did this good man come <normalised orig="furnisht" auto="true">furnished</normalised><lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
to the <normalised orig="Episcopall" auto="true">Episcopal</normalised> <normalised orig="Chaire" auto="true">Chair</normalised>; and being there <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised><lb/>
kept them: like as he did also his <normalised orig="firme" auto="true">firm</normalised> purpose of single<lb/>
life, which though it be not of it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> a <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> but a<lb/>
State; yet he that could <normalised orig="liue" auto="true">live</normalised> in that state, free not only<lb/>
from the act, but from all <normalised orig="suspition" auto="true">suspicion</normalised> of <normalised orig="vncleannesse" auto="true">uncleanness</normalised>,<lb/>
as I <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> no man in this age <normalised orig="liued" auto="true">lived</normalised> more free; had certainly<lb/>
attained that excellent gift, which our <normalised orig="Sauiour" auto="true">Saviour</normalised><lb/>
commends, and <normalised orig="wisheth" auto="true">wishes</normalised> them that <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> it to make<lb/>
<normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> of as of a great <normalised orig="aduantage" auto="true">advantage</normalised>, and <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> to <normalised orig="godlines" auto="false">godliness</normalised>,<lb/>
<notvariant>Matth</notvariant>. 19.12.<lb/>
Now as the <normalised orig="varietie" auto="true">variety</normalised> of his preferments in the<lb/>
world, did no way hinder him in the practice of these<lb/>
his <normalised orig="priuate" auto="true">private</normalised> and <normalised orig="personall" auto="true">personal</normalised> <normalised orig="vertues" auto="true">virtues</normalised>; (as <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> said:)<lb/>
so did they <normalised orig="yeild" auto="true">yield</normalised> him a greater furtherance or <normalised orig="opportunitie" auto="true">opportunity</normalised><lb/>
at least of acting some others, which I may call<lb/>
<normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> or <normalised orig="Pastorall" auto="true">Pastoral</normalised>.<lb/>
For first, as he had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> <normalised orig="liberall" auto="true">liberal</normalised>, from the<lb/>
time he had any thing to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised>; so <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the increase of<lb/>
his fortunes <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> <normalised orig="improued" auto="false">improved</normalised> that <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> to a kind of<lb/>
Magnificence. I am verily <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised>, if <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> had<lb/>
attained to that wealth which some of our English<lb/>
Prelates heretofore <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> done: <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> built<lb/>
Churches and <normalised orig="Colledges" auto="true">Colleges</normalised> . But his <normalised orig="forwardnesse" auto="true">forwardness</normalised> in this<lb/>
kind, could <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> stay till his purse were full: therefore<lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> attained to the doing of any pompous<lb/>
<normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised>. But if it were possible to lay together his <normalised orig="ordinarie" auto="true">ordinary</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="largesse" auto="true">largess</normalised> to the <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> at his gates, and in the<lb/>

                  <lb/>
all which he kept no <normalised orig="Kalender" auto="true">Calendar</normalised>. I assure my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> they<lb/>
would arise to as great a <normalised orig="summe" auto="true">sum</normalised> as the <normalised orig="workes" auto="true">works</normalised> of one of<lb/>
the greatest <normalised orig="Benefactours" auto="true">Benefactors</normalised> of our time. Besides his increasing<lb/>
of the allowance of the <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> Brethren of<lb/>
Saint <normalised orig="Crosse" auto="true">Cross</normalised>, both in diet and otherwise, (which<lb/>
was worthily continued by his <normalised orig="Successour" auto="true">Successor</normalised>) his <normalised orig="maintayning" auto="true">maintaining</normalised><lb/>
of two Lectures in New <normalised orig="Colledge" auto="true">College</normalised> in Oxford,<lb/>
one for the Hebrew Tongue, another for the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Mathematickes" auto="false">Mathematics</normalised>: his leading the way to the setting<lb/>
<normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> of the great Organ in the Church of Worcester,<lb/>
and to the founding of a <normalised orig="Librarie" auto="true">Library</normalised> there, as also of another<lb/>
in <normalised orig="Welles" auto="true">Wells</normalised>, might well be reckoned as particular<lb/>
instances of his <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> extended <normalised orig="bountie" auto="true">bounty</normalised> in this<lb/>
<normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised>.<lb/>
 Next his <normalised orig="Magnanimitie" auto="true">Magnanimity</normalised> and Courage<lb/>
appeared well in the <normalised orig="gouernment" auto="true">government</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Vniuersitie" auto="true">University</normalised>,<lb/>
that one <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> wherein he bare the office of <normalised orig="Vicechancellour" auto="false">Vice-chancellor</normalised>;<lb/>
For as they well know that <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> had experience<lb/>
of that place, the animosity of some spirits there,<lb/>
being like <notvariant>Alexanders</notvariant> horse, generous indeed, and<lb/>
fit for great <normalised orig="seruices" auto="true">services</normalised>, but yet fierce and <normalised orig="vntractable" auto="true">untractable</normalised><lb/>
for the time, requires no <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> then an Alexander<lb/>
to <normalised orig="curbe" auto="true">curb</normalised> them, and to bring them to their due<lb/>
temper and pace. And such an Alexander was he.<lb/>
For, notwithstanding all opposition that is <normalised orig="vsually" auto="true">usually</normalised><lb/>
made in that kind, <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> <normalised orig="reuiued" auto="true">revived</normalised> much of the ancient<lb/>
Discipline there: and indeed wrought such a sensible<lb/>
reformation <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the more <notvariant>distempered</notvariant> parts of the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Vniuersity" auto="true">University</normalised>, that as I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> credibly heard, it was deliberated<lb/>
by those that had the highest care of that place<lb/>

                  <fw type="pageNum">§</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> continued him longer therein, though a consecrated<lb/>
Bishop: had not he of his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> desirous<lb/>
to attend his greatest charge, <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> <normalised orig="auerse" auto="true">averse</normalised><lb/>
from <normalised orig="receiuing" auto="true">receiving</normalised> any such dispensation.<lb/>
 Next to his <normalised orig="Magnanimitie" auto="true">Magnanimity</normalised>, if not a part of<lb/>
it, I may reckon his Contempt of wealth, and especially<lb/>
of that manner of getting wealth which is too<lb/>
commonly in <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> among them which <normalised orig="seeke" auto="true">seek</normalised>.<lb/>
                  <notvariant>quocunque</notvariant> <notvariant>modo</notvariant> <notvariant>rem</notvariant>.
                  <lb/>
Had he made that his rule, he might <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> a rich<lb/>
man. But I dare say, that in all Elections of <normalised orig="Schollers" auto="false">Scholars</normalised>,<lb/>
Collations of Orders, and Benefices, Dispositions<lb/>
of Offices, and Grants of <normalised orig="Colledge" auto="true">College</normalised> and Church-leases<lb/>
that passed through his hands, as there passed in his<lb/>
time very many, he <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> fouled them with the least<lb/>
touch of a <notvariant>Gehazi's</notvariant> reward, which Integrity of his, together<lb/>
with his <normalised orig="open-handednesse" auto="false">open-handedness</normalised> and house-keeping,<lb/>
were the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> causes that he left no greater estate<lb/>
behind him.<lb/>
But to come yet more <normalised orig="nearely" auto="true">nearly</normalised> to the discharge of<lb/>
his <normalised orig="Episcopall" auto="true">Episcopal</normalised> Function. His <normalised orig="Abilitie" auto="true">Ability</normalised> to teach,<lb/>
(which Saint Paul makes one of the <normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised> <normalised orig="vertues" auto="true">virtues</normalised><lb/>
of a Bishop) as it was very great, so did it <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> more, then after he came to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> ex <notvariant>cathedra</notvariant>,<lb/>
for although the acts of <normalised orig="gouernment" auto="true">government</normalised> alone may<lb/>
<normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> sufficient to take <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> a man in that place: yet he<lb/>
knowing that there is a double honour which Saint<lb/>
Paul <normalised orig="allowes" auto="true">allows</normalised> to such as <normalised orig="doe" auto="false">do</normalised> not only rule well, but<lb/>
also labour in the Word and Doctrine, 1. Tim. 5.<lb/>

                  <lb/>
Saint Augustine, Saint <normalised orig="Gregorie" auto="false">Gregory</normalised> the Great, and<lb/>
other ancient Bishops, whose Homilies wee <normalised orig="enioy" auto="true">enjoy</normalised> and<lb/>
read at this day, and <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="ceast" auto="true">ceased</normalised> after he was a Bishop<lb/>
to <normalised orig="adorne" auto="true">adorn</normalised> the Pulpit with his no <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> frequent and assiduous,<lb/>

he came, if it were a fit time of preaching <normalised orig="vnsupplied" auto="false">unsupplied</normalised>.<lb/>
Besides all which, his <normalised orig="ordinarie" auto="true">ordinary</normalised> Discourses were in one<lb/>
kind or other as good as Lectures to those that heard<lb/>
them: for indeed, he was a man of rare <normalised orig="sufficiencie" auto="true">sufficiency</normalised><lb/>
in all parts of Learning; and for any doubts that were<lb/>
proposed to him, whether <normalised orig="historicall" auto="true">historical</normalised>, <normalised orig="textuall" auto="true">textual</normalised>, <normalised orig="practicall" auto="true">practical</normalised><lb/>
or <normalised orig="controuersall" auto="false">controversies</normalised>; as his <normalised orig="readinesse" auto="true">readiness</normalised> was singular to<lb/>
take notice of them; so was his <normalised orig="dexteritie" auto="true">dexterity</normalised> no <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> happy<lb/>
in <normalised orig="resoluing" auto="true">resolving</normalised> them: So that to conclude for this point, I<lb/>
may say he was a <normalised orig="Salomon" auto="false">Solomon</normalised> to his <normalised orig="houshold" auto="true">household</normalised> <normalised orig="Seruants" auto="true">Servants</normalised>;<lb/>
to the City where he <normalised orig="liued" auto="true">lived</normalised> an Oracle: to any <normalised orig="Scholler" auto="true">Scholar</normalised><lb/>
that resorted to him a <normalised orig="liuing" auto="true">living</normalised> <normalised orig="librarie" auto="true">library</normalised>: &amp; to the whole<lb/>
Church such a Priest as God <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> describes by his<lb/>

                  <lb/>
But it is required of a Bishop, that <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> should <notvariant>pascere</notvariant><lb/>
<notvariant>cibo</notvariant> too as well as <notvariant>verbo</notvariant>: and therefore Saint<lb/>

first at Saint <normalised orig="Crosse" auto="true">Cross</normalised>, (where <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> made it his<lb/>

not with <normalised orig="drie" auto="true">dry</normalised> Pensions as his Predecessors for the most<lb/>

with constant, <normalised orig="solide" auto="false">solid</normalised>, and <normalised orig="substantiall" auto="true">substantial</normalised> <normalised orig="meales" auto="true">meals</normalised>:) and<lb/>
then <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterwards</normalised> at his <normalised orig="Deanerie" auto="true">Deanery</normalised> of Worcester,<lb/>
(where he entertained the better sort with that splendour,<lb/>

that the whole <normalised orig="Countrie" auto="true">Country</normalised> rings of it to this day:)<lb/>
to omit these, I say; the list of his <normalised orig="ordinarie" auto="true">ordinary</normalised> Family<lb/>
which he kept in diet after <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> came to the <normalised orig="Bishopricke" auto="true">Bishopric</normalised><lb/>
of Bath and <normalised orig="Welles" auto="true">Wells</normalised> did commonly consist of at least<lb/>
<normalised orig="fiftie" auto="true">fifty</normalised> persons; a great part whereof <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> kept not so<lb/>
much for any state or attendance <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> his person, as out<lb/>
of pure <normalised orig="charitie" auto="true">charity</normalised> in regard of their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="priuate" auto="true">private</normalised> needs.<lb/>
Besides all which, his gates were the daily <normalised orig="refectorie" auto="false">refectory</normalised><lb/>
of his <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> neighbours; and for <normalised orig="superuenient" auto="false">supervenient</normalised> strangers<lb/>
he was another Abraham, a Lot, <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> suffering<lb/>
any man of fashion, <normalised orig="Schollers" auto="false">Scholars</normalised> especially, that<lb/>
came to him <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> <normalised orig="businesse" auto="true">business</normalised> or otherwise to depart <normalised orig="emptie" auto="true">empty</normalised><lb/>
away.<lb/>
Now in this <normalised orig="rankenesse" auto="false">rankeness</normalised> of housekeeping, I know<lb/>
it is a disease that commonly <normalised orig="fals" auto="true">false</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> great Families,<lb/>
that they grow disorderly and riotous, abusing oftentimes<lb/>
the <normalised orig="bountie" auto="true">bounty</normalised> of a good Lord or Master to their<lb/>
<normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> hurt and the <normalised orig="scandall" auto="true">scandal</normalised> of others. Which fault lest<lb/>
any man should suspect to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> in his house, I cannot<lb/>
but remember another <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> of his (which Saint<lb/>
Paul commends also in a Bishop) and that is the<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Tim 3.4">ruling of his house well</quote>: and <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> those that are<lb/>

                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
man had so. For notwithstanding his large allowances<lb/>
of all things fit for the entertainment of strangers, you<lb/>
should see no footsteps of riot or <normalised orig="excesse" auto="true">excess</normalised> in his house:<lb/>
No <normalised orig="tipling" auto="true">tippling</normalised> or <normalised orig="carowsing" auto="true">carousing</normalised> of <notvariant>healths</notvariant>; no casting of the<lb/>
<normalised orig="childrens" auto="false">children's</normalised> bread <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> dogs; not so much as any <normalised orig="hawkes" auto="true">hawks</normalised><lb/>

hunted after the <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> of <normalised orig="Heauen" auto="true">Heaven</normalised>. And the<lb/>
reason of all this I take to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> first his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> example,<lb/>
who was indeed a <normalised orig="patterne" auto="true">pattern</normalised> of <normalised orig="sobrietie" auto="true">sobriety</normalised>, and of<lb/>
all good <normalised orig="conuersation" auto="true">conversation</normalised>, as Saint Paul <normalised orig="wisheth" auto="true">wishes</normalised> <normalised orig="Timothie" auto="false">Timothy</normalised><lb/>
to be: then the choice of his <normalised orig="seruants" auto="true">servants</normalised> wherein<lb/>
he imitated <normalised orig="Dauid" auto="false">David</normalised>, <notvariant>Psal</notvariant>. 101. 8. and lastly his training<lb/>
them <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> whom he entertained in true <normalised orig="pietie" auto="true">piety</normalised> and <normalised orig="deuotion" auto="true">devotion</normalised>.<lb/>
For besides his ordinary <normalised orig="Chappell" auto="true">Chapel</normalised> <normalised orig="houres" auto="true">hours</normalised> which<lb/>
he saw <normalised orig="duely" auto="true">duly</normalised> and by all frequented: <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> caused many of<lb/>
his household to assist <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> morning at the <normalised orig="sixe" auto="true">six</normalised> a <normalised orig="clocke" auto="true">clock</normalised><lb/>
Prayers in the <normalised orig="Cathedrall" auto="true">Cathedral</normalised> Church <normalised orig="adioyning" auto="true">adjoining</normalised>: <normalised orig="Hee" auto="false">He</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> sate <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> to his <normalised orig="meales" auto="true">meals</normalised>, but he had according<lb/>
to the ancient fashion of Bishops a Chapter of the holy<lb/>
Bible, read by one whom he kept for that purpose;<lb/>
and lastly, at the close of the night, he called his whole<lb/>
Family into his ordinary dining <normalised orig="roome" auto="true">room</normalised>, and therein his<lb/>
<normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> person most <normalised orig="deuoutly" auto="true">devoutly</normalised> commended them by his<lb/>
prayers <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> <normalised orig="Almightie" auto="true">Almighty</normalised> God. Which thing though it<lb/>
be no more then <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> Christian housekeeper in his particular<lb/>
charge <normalised orig="doth" auto="false">does</normalised> or should <normalised orig="doe" auto="false">do</normalised>; yet I account it the<lb/>
more memorable in a man of his place, because the<lb/>
multitude and different <normalised orig="qualitie" auto="true">quality</normalised> of their attendants<lb/>
<normalised orig="seemes" auto="true">seems</normalised> ordinarily <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> such a sufficient pretence to remit<lb/>
that <normalised orig="dutie" auto="true">duty</normalised> to their <normalised orig="Chaplaines" auto="true">Chaplains</normalised>, if not to lay it quite<lb/>
aside.<lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
Now as the Philosopher <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised>, that each <normalised orig="priuate" auto="true">private</normalised><lb/>
Family is the <normalised orig="modell" auto="true">model</normalised> of a Common-wealth: so may I say<lb/>
that each Christian Family is the <normalised orig="modell" auto="true">model</normalised> of a Church:<lb/>
and therefore no wonder if he that was so good at the<lb/>
ordering of the one, <normalised orig="proued" auto="true">proved</normalised> no <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> excellent in the administration<lb/>
of the other. The care of his <normalised orig="Diocesse" auto="true">Diocese</normalised> as<lb/>
it was of all other his greatest, and that which most<lb/>
<normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> him <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised>; so did it bring forth in him fruits of exemplary<lb/>
diligence, and such as <normalised orig="deserue" auto="true">deserve</normalised> not to be concealed<lb/>
from the World.<lb/>
For first, whereas the foundation of all good order<lb/>
in a Church, is the planting of an able and learned<lb/>
<normalised orig="Ministery" auto="true">Ministry</normalised>, which thing <normalised orig="appertaines" auto="true">appertains</normalised> to the care of<lb/>
the Bishop, and <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> accounted a <normalised orig="chiefe" auto="true">chief</normalised><lb/>
branch of his <notvariant>supereminent</notvariant> power: in the discharge<lb/>
hereof he was so <normalised orig="carefull" auto="true">careful</normalised> and precise, that he <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised><lb/>
conferred holy Orders <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> any person, whom he did<lb/>
not first examine strictly according to the Canons of the<lb/>
Church; neither did <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> trust herein any <normalised orig="Chaplaine" auto="true">Chaplain</normalised> or<lb/>
other <normalised orig="Deputie" auto="true">Deputy</normalised>; but <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> personally performed the<lb/>
office for the satisfaction of his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> conscience, as one<lb/>
that meant to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> an account to God for what <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> did.<lb/>
A worthy example <normalised orig="doubtlesse" auto="true">doubtless</normalised>, which if it were imitated<lb/>
by all the rest of that Venerable <normalised orig="ranke" auto="true">rank</normalised>, neither on<lb/>
the one side would they <normalised orig="bee" auto="false">be</normalised> troubled with so many clamours<lb/>

<normalised orig="Clergie" auto="true">Clergy</normalised>: nor on the other would they <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> such cause as<lb/>
oftentimes they <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> to <notvariant>beshrew</notvariant> their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> fingers for<lb/>
ordaining them, who are no sooner put into the <normalised orig="Ministerie" auto="true">Ministry</normalised>,<lb/>

<normalised orig="schisme" auto="true">schism</normalised> against that very <normalised orig="authoritie" auto="true">authority</normalised> which ordained<lb/>

As he was thus <normalised orig="prouident" auto="true">provident</normalised> to plant a good <normalised orig="Ministerie" auto="true">Ministry</normalised><lb/>
in his <normalised orig="Diocesse" auto="true">Diocese</normalised>, so was <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> no <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> <normalised orig="carefull" auto="true">careful</normalised> to<lb/>
cherish those who were <normalised orig="alreadie" auto="true">already</normalised> planted. His care of<lb/>
them all in <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> was most tender and <notvariant>fatherlike</notvariant>.<lb/>
The most eminent among them for <normalised orig="Pietie" auto="true">Piety</normalised> and Learning<lb/>
he did not only <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> most familiarly; but studied to<lb/>
draw them nearest to <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> by <normalised orig="prouiding" auto="true">providing</normalised> them of<lb/>
<notvariant>Prebends</notvariant> in his Church, wherein it was his want of<lb/>
<normalised orig="opportunitie" auto="true">opportunity</normalised> rather then of desire and <normalised orig="forwardnesse" auto="true">forwardness</normalised><lb/>
that he did no more. And lastly, to the weaker sort<lb/>
of them he spared not to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> his <normalised orig="aduice" auto="true">advice</normalised> and direction<lb/>
<normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> all occasions how they might enable <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised><lb/>
for the better discharge of their calling; to which purpose<lb/>
he had both intended and begun a <normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised> and familiar<lb/>
explanation of the Doctrine of the Church of<lb/>
England, contained in the <normalised orig="Catechisme" auto="true">Catechism</normalised> and <normalised orig="thirtie" auto="true">thirty</normalised><lb/>
nine Articles which he meant to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> communicated<lb/>
to them for their proper <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> and instruction; but the<lb/>
interruption of Parliaments and other great <normalised orig="affaires" auto="true">affairs</normalised><lb/>
toward his later time, and at last his <normalised orig="vntimely" auto="true">untimely</normalised> and<lb/>
much lamented death, as it <normalised orig="seemes" auto="true">seems</normalised>, put an end to that<lb/>

I Desire to end my life in that faith, which is now<lb/>

well nigh <normalised orig="thirtie" auto="true">thirty</normalised> <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> a Preacher: and my<lb/>
<normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised> <normalised orig="vnfained" auto="true">unfeigned</normalised> desire is, that it may <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> flourish,<lb/>

his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> conscience to <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised>: And then I doubt not<lb/>
but as an eminent Prelate of the Church of Rome said<lb/>
of the doctrine of <normalised orig="Iustification" auto="true">Justification</normalised> by faith only, that<lb/>
it was a good Supper-doctrine, though not so good to<lb/>
<normalised orig="breake" auto="true">break</normalised> fast on: so it would <normalised orig="bee" auto="false">be</normalised> acknowledged of our reformed<lb/>

plausible and pleasant a religion to <normalised orig="liue" auto="true">live</normalised> in, as some other<lb/>
may be, yet it is the only comfortable Religion to die<lb/>
in; as being that which settles a man <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the true<lb/>
<normalised orig="rocke" auto="true">rock</normalised>, and <normalised orig="giues" auto="true">gives</normalised> a sure footing to his faith, when all the<lb/>

hundred pounds worth, <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> disposed to the <normalised orig="Librarie" auto="true">Library</normalised> of<lb/>
New <normalised orig="Colledge" auto="true">College</normalised> in Oxford, by a Deed of Gift <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> before his death, <normalised orig="reseruing" auto="true">reserving</normalised> the <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> of them<lb/>
only for his life time:) could not <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> much left to bestow<lb/>
at his death. Only a name <normalised orig="hee" auto="false">he</normalised> <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> left behind<lb/>
him, and that more precious then any ointment a name<lb/>
that <normalised orig="filleth" auto="true">fills</normalised> the Church for the present, with the sweet<lb/>
<normalised orig="sauour" auto="true">savour</normalised> thereof, and I trust that <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> <normalised orig="Posteritie" auto="true">Posterity</normalised> also<lb/>
shall be refreshed by it. For the <normalised orig="memoriall" auto="true">memorial</normalised> of <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised>,<lb/>
(as he saith) is <normalised orig="immortall" auto="true">immortal</normalised>; because it is <normalised orig="approued" auto="true">approved</normalised><lb/>
both with God, and Men. When it is<lb/>
present men take example at it, and when it is gone<lb/>
they desire it: it <normalised orig="weareth" auto="true">wears</normalised> a <normalised orig="Crowne" auto="true">Crown</normalised> and <normalised orig="triumpheth" auto="true">triumphs</normalised><lb/>
for <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised>, <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> gotten the <normalised orig="victorie" auto="true">victory</normalised>, and <normalised orig="striuing" auto="true">striving</normalised><lb/>
for <normalised orig="euerlasting" auto="true">everlasting</normalised> rewards.<lb/>
As touching the manner of his death, though any<lb/>
man might <normalised orig="guesse" auto="true">guess</normalised> at it that <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> acquainted thus<lb/>

                  <lb/>
to acquaint thee with thus much, that <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> some<lb/>
few <normalised orig="houres" auto="true">hours</normalised> before his departure made a zealous and<lb/>
<normalised orig="deuout" auto="true">devout</normalised> confession both of his faith and <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised>, to the<lb/>
Bishop of <notvariant>Elie</notvariant> there present, from whom also he <normalised orig="receiued" auto="true">received</normalised><lb/>
absolution according to the order of our Church:<lb/>
and being assisted to the last <normalised orig="gaspe" auto="true">gasp</normalised> with the comfortable<lb/>
and <normalised orig="heauenly" auto="true">heavenly</normalised> prayers of that <normalised orig="diuine" auto="true">divine</normalised> Prelate; after<lb/>
he had taken particular <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> of all about him, and <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised><lb/>
them <normalised orig="respectiuely" auto="true">respectively</normalised> both his <normalised orig="counsell" auto="true">counsel</normalised> and benediction:<lb/>
he speedily <normalised orig="yeilded" auto="true">yielded</normalised> <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> his <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> to God.<lb/>
There passed not many <normalised orig="moneths" auto="true">months</normalised> before that <normalised orig="Reuerend" auto="true">Reverend</normalised><lb/>
Bishop, whom I last mentioned, followed him to<lb/>
his <normalised orig="graue" auto="true">grave</normalised>: with whom as he had <normalised orig="liued" auto="true">lived</normalised> many <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> in a<lb/>
most entire league of friendship, not <normalised orig="vnlike" auto="true">unlike</normalised> that which<lb/>
Saint <notvariant>Chrysostome</notvariant> describes to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> betwixt<lb/>
<normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> and Saint Basil (Lib.1. de <notvariant>Sacerdotio</notvariant>)so<lb/>
I doubt not but they are now <normalised orig="vnited" auto="true">united</normalised> and incorporated<lb/>
together in a <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> more <normalised orig="firme" auto="true">firm</normalised> and <normalised orig="vndiuided" auto="false">undivided</normalised> <normalised orig="societie" auto="true">society</normalised>,<lb/>
