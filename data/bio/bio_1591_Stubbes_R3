Death of <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Katherine Stubs: who <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> she<lb/>

perfect pattern of true Christianity. She was descended of<lb/>
honest and wealthy Parents: her Father had borne divers<lb/>
Offices of worship in his Company, amongst whom he lived<lb/>
in great account, credit, and estimation all his <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, he was<lb/>
zealous in the truth, and of a sound Religion. Her mother was<lb/>
a Dutch woman, both discreet and wise, of a singular good<lb/>
grace and modesty: and which did most <normalised orig="adorne" auto="true">adorn</normalised> her, she was<lb/>
both religious and also zealous.<lb/>
This couple living together in the city of London, many<lb/>
years, it pleased God to bless them with children, of whom<lb/>
this Katherine was youngest but one, but as <choice ana="illegible">

But presently upon this sudden recovery, it pleased God to<lb/>

thereabout: During all which time, she was never <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> nor<lb/>
perceived to sleep one hour together, neither night nor day, and<lb/>
yet the Lord preserved her (which was miraculous) in her perfect<lb/>

she would answer, I beseech you pray not that I should live<lb/>
for I think it long to be with my God: Christ is to me life, and<lb/>
death is to me advantage: yea, the day of death is the birthday<lb/>

Sometimes she would speak very softly to her self, &amp; sometimes<lb/>

to come forth of her mouth, during all the time of her <normalised orig="sicknes" auto="true">sickness</normalised>.<lb/>
She was accustomed many times, as she lay, very suddenly<lb/>
to fall into a sweet smiling, and sometimes into a most hearty<lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
laughter, her face appearing right fair, amiable, and lovely:<lb/>
and her countenance seemed as though she greatly <normalised orig="rejoyced" auto="true">rejoiced</normalised> at<lb/>
some glorious sight. And when her Husband would <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> her<lb/>
why she smiled and laughed so? she would answer O, if you<lb/>
saw such glorious and heavenly sights as I see, you would rejoice<lb/>
and laugh with me: for I see a vision of the <normalised orig="joyes" auto="true">joys</normalised> of heaven,<lb/>
and of the glory that I shall go unto; and I see infinite<lb/>
millions of Angels attendant upon me, and watching over<lb/>
me, ready to carry my soul into the <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> of Heaven.<lb/>
In regard whereof, she was willing to forsake her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, her<lb/>
Husband, her child, and all the world besides. And so calling<lb/>
for her child which the Nurse brought unto her, she took it up<lb/>
in her arms and kissed it, and said God <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> thee, my sweet<lb/>
Babe, and make thee an heir of the <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> of Heaven: and<lb/>
kissing it <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, delivered it to the Nurse, with these words,<lb/>
to her husband standing by; Beloved Husband, I bequeath<lb/>
this my child unto you, he is no longer mine, he is the Lords<lb/>
and yours, I forsake him, you, and all the world, yea, and mine<lb/>
<normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, and esteem all things but dung, that I may win<lb/>
<normalised orig="Iesus" auto="true">Jesus</normalised> Christ: and I pray you, sweet Husband, bring up this<lb/>
Child in good letters, in Learning and Discipline, and above<lb/>
all things, see that he be brought up and instructed in the exercise<lb/>
of true Religion.<lb/>
The child being taken away, she espied a little Puppy, or,<lb/>
Bitch, (which in her health she loved well) lying upon her bed<lb/>
she had no sooner espied her, but she beat her away, and calling<lb/>
her Husband to her, said, good Husband, you and I have offended<lb/>
God grievously, in receiving this Bitch many a time<lb/>
into our bed: we would have been <normalised orig="loth" auto="true">loath</normalised> to have received a Christian<lb/>
<normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised>, purchased with the <normalised orig="pretious" auto="true">precious</normalised> blood of <normalised orig="Iesus" auto="true">Jesus</normalised> Christ,<lb/>
into our bed, and to have nourished him in our bosoms, and<lb/>
to have fed him at our table, as we have done this filthy Cur<lb/>
many times: the Lord give me grace to repent it, and all other<lb/>
vanities: And afterwards she could not abide to look upon the<lb/>
Bitch any more.<lb/>
Having thus godly disposed all things, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> fell into a<lb/>
Trance, or <normalised orig="swound" auto="true">swooned</normalised>, for almost the space of a quarter of an<lb/>

<normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> coming to her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, <normalised orig="spake" auto="false">spoke</normalised> to them that were<lb/>

                  <lb/>
to requite you, I beseech the Lord requite you in the kingdom<lb/>
of Heaven, and for that my <normalised orig="houre-glasse" auto="false">hourglass</normalised> is run out, and that<lb/>
my time of departure hence is at hand, I am <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> for<lb/>
three causes to make a confession of my Faith before you all.<lb/>
The first cause that <normalised orig="moveth" auto="true">moves</normalised> me thereto is, for that those (if<lb/>
there be any such here) that are not yet <normalised orig="throughly" auto="true">thoroughly</normalised> resolved in<lb/>
the truth of God, may hear and learn what the spirit of God<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> taught me, out of his blessed and <normalised orig="alsaving" auto="false">allsaving</normalised> Word.<lb/>
The second cause that <normalised orig="moveth" auto="true">moves</normalised> me, is, for that none of you<lb/>
shall judge that I <normalised orig="dyed" auto="false">died</normalised> not a perfect Christian, and a perfect<lb/>
member of the <normalised orig="mysticall" auto="true">mystical</normalised> body of <normalised orig="Iesus" auto="true">Jesus</normalised> Christ, and so by your<lb/>
rash judgment might <normalised orig="incurre" auto="true">incur</normalised> the displeasure of God.<lb/>
The third and last cause is, for that as you have been witnesses<lb/>
of part of my Life, so you might be witnesses of part<lb/>
of may Faith and <normalised orig="Beleefe" auto="true">Belief</normalised> also.<lb/>
And this is my confession, I would not have you to think<lb/>
that it is I that speak unto you, But the Spirit of God that<lb/>
<normalised orig="dwelleth" auto="true">dwells</normalised> in me and all the elect of God, <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> they be reprobates.<lb/>
For S. Paul saith <notvariant>Rom</notvariant>. 8. <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 8.9">If any one have not the spirit of<lb/>
Christ dwelling in him, he is none of his.</quote> This blessed Spirit<lb/>

me grace to open the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised> of my heart, and he <normalised orig="dwelleth" auto="true">dwells</normalised><lb/>
in me plentifully. And therefore I pray you lend your patience<lb/>
a little and imprint my words in your hearts: for they<lb/>
are not the words of flesh and blood, but the Spirit of God,<lb/>
by whom we are sealed to the day of our redemption.<lb/>

she desired him he would not mourn for her, <normalised orig="alledging" auto="true">alleging</normalised><lb/>
the Apostle Paul where he saith <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Thess 4.13">Brethren, I would not have you<lb/>
to mourn, as men without hope</quote>, for them that <normalised orig="dye" auto="false">die</normalised> in the Lord: affirming,<lb/>
that she was not in case to be mourned for, but rather<lb/>
to be <normalised orig="rejoyced" auto="true">rejoiced</normalised> of, for that she should <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> (as she said) from<lb/>
Earth to Heaven, from men to holy Angels, <notvariant>Cherubims</notvariant> and<lb/>
<notvariant>Seraphims</notvariant>, to holy Saints, Patriarchs, and Fathers, yea to<lb/>
God himself. After which words, very suddenly she seemed as<lb/>
it were greatly to <normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised>, and looked cheerfully, as though she<lb/>
had seen some glorious sight: And lifting up her whole body,<lb/>
and stretching forth both her arms, as though she would <normalised orig="imbrace" auto="true">embrace</normalised><lb/>
some glorious and pleasant thing, said: I thank my God<lb/>
through <normalised orig="Iesus" auto="true">Jesus</normalised> Christ, he is come, he is come, my good <normalised orig="Iaylor" auto="true">Jailer</normalised><lb/>
is come to let my <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> out of prison. O sweet death, thou art<lb/>
welcome, welcome sweet death: never was there any guest so<lb/>
welcome unto me as thou art welcome, the messenger of everlasting<lb/>
life: welcome the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised> and entrance into everlasting<lb/>
glory. welcome I say and thrice welcome my good <normalised orig="Iaylor" auto="true">Jailer</normalised>, <normalised orig="doe" auto="false">do</normalised><lb/>
thy office quickly, and set my soul at liberty: Strike sweet<lb/>
death, strike my heart, I fear not that stroke: now it is. Father<lb/>
into thy blessed hands I commend my spirit: sweet <normalised orig="Iesus" auto="true">Jesus</normalised>, into<lb/>
thy hands I commend my spirit: blessed spirit of God, I commit<lb/>
my soul into thy hands: O most holy, blessed and glorious<lb/>
<normalised orig="Trinitie" auto="true">Trinity</normalised>, three persons and one true and everlasting God, into<lb/>
thy blessed hands I commit my soul and body: at which<lb/>
words her breath stayed, and so moving neither hand nor foot<lb/>
she slept sweetly in the Lord.<lb/>
Thus <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> thou heard (gentle Reader) the discourse of the<lb/>
<normalised orig="vertuous" auto="true">virtuous</normalised> life and Christian death of this blessed and <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised><lb/>
servant of God, <normalised orig="Mistris" auto="true">Mistress</normalised> Katherine Stubs: which is so much the<lb/>
more <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised>, in that she was but young and tender in<lb/>

departed this life. The Lord give us grace to follow her example,<lb/>
that we may come to those unspeakable joys wherein<lb/>
she now <normalised orig="resteth" auto="true">rests</normalised>, through <normalised orig="Iesus" auto="true">Jesus</normalised> Christ our Lord: To whom<lb/>
