               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
GRegory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant> was born at Madrid<lb/>
in Spain. He seemed to have had<lb/>
neither Father nor Mother, nor Kindred<lb/>
(as S. Paul said of <notvariant>Melchisedech</notvariant>)<lb/>
inasmuch as never any heard him<lb/>
speak of his Parentage; nor, in all the time<lb/>
he was in these parts of New Spain, which<lb/>
was four and thirty years, writ he to his<lb/>
Kindred, or asked after them. And this<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> occasioned some curious persons to<lb/>
imagine, that he was very nobly descended;<lb/>
the Son of some prime Gentleman of <notvariant>Castile</notvariant>:<lb/>
which they gathered likewise from<lb/>
his behaviour, being discreet, noble, and full<lb/>
of an humble gravity; which he manifested<lb/>
when he treated with any <normalised orig="Ecclesiastick" auto="true">Ecclesiastic</normalised>, or<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="2">B</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
Secular person of quality: for, observing<lb/>
always the due respect and reverence <normalised orig="sutable" auto="true">suitable</normalised><lb/>
to every ones condition, he had an admirable<lb/>
Liberty of spirit, <notvariant>wherewith</notvariant> he <normalised orig="spake" auto="false">spoke</normalised><lb/>
to them; and resolution, <notvariant>wherewith</notvariant> he treated<lb/>
any business with them. This is the opinion,<lb/>
some had of the linage of Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant>;<lb/>
all, that I could gather from certain discourses<lb/>
I had with him on this subject, is,<lb/>
that his parents were rather poor, than rich;<lb/>
yet, of what rank they were, I could never<lb/>
learn; though a few <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> before his death,<lb/>
I resolved to ask him their names, that I<lb/>
might make to them a relation of, and they<lb/>
might rejoice, and reap edification from, so<lb/>
good a life, and death. <notvariant>Whereunto</notvariant> he made<lb/>
me this answer: Since I went into the field to<lb/>
lead a solitary life, I have held God only for my<lb/>
Father; my Brethren by this time may be dead,<lb/>
for I was the <normalised orig="yongest" auto="true">youngest</normalised>. Such an oblivion of his<lb/>
Family retained this Servant of God; esteeming<lb/>
all nobility as baseness; and only<lb/>
valuing the power, that God <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> given us<lb/>
to make our selves his Sons in the Spirit.<lb/>
He was born the 4th. of July in the Year<lb/>
1542. on the Day whereon was then kept<lb/>
the feast of S. Gregory <notvariant>Thaumaturgus</notvariant>, though<lb/>
now this Festivity be transferred to the 17th<lb/>
of November. He was <normalised orig="baptized" auto="true">baptised</normalised> in the Parish<lb/>
of S. Giles, and called Gregory, because<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="3">2</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
born on the <normalised orig="forementioned" auto="false">aforementioned</normalised> day. The name<lb/>
of <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant> I take not for that of his House;<lb/>
but that he was willing to assume it for disguising<lb/>
his Family. He had two Sisters, and<lb/>
divers Brothers; and, though Gregory was<lb/>
in age the <normalised orig="yongest" auto="true">youngest</normalised> of all, yet it is credible,<lb/>
that he surpassed them in merit, and in the<lb/>
true Nobility, that derives from <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised>.<lb/>
Our Lord prevented him with his Grace<lb/>
very early in his Childhood; for, asked by<lb/>
me on a certain occasion when he had begun<lb/>
to serve God, whether it were as soon<lb/>
as he had the use of reason; he answered,<lb/>
he knew not for certain, whether it were<lb/>
then, or a little after: but that he was very<lb/>
sure, that our Lord called him very early,<lb/>
so that he had never been a <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> in his manners.<lb/>
And he used to say, as one well experienced,<lb/>
what the Holy Ghost <normalised orig="spake" auto="false">spoke</normalised> by<lb/>
<notvariant>Jeremias</notvariant>: That <quote type="biblical" ana="Lam 3.27">it would go well with the<lb/>
man, who <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> carried Gods yoke from his<lb/>
youth.</quote> Lam. 3.27.<lb/>
In his Childhood he learnt to <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised>, and<lb/>
write, wherein he proved very eminent: as<lb/>
may be seen sufficiently in certain papers,<lb/>
we have, written by his own hand, so fair,<lb/>
<normalised orig="eaven" auto="true">even</normalised>, and curious, that they look like Printing.<lb/>
It is a thing averred, and by him also<lb/>
plainly confessed, that he never learned <normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised>;<lb/>
nor any of the <normalised orig="liberall" auto="true">liberal</normalised> Arts: Whence<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="4">B2</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
it follows, that in many things he had only<lb/>
God for his Master; and by his sole conduct<lb/>
arrived to many natural, and divine truths,<lb/>
which men that spend their whole life in<lb/>
those studies, can scarcely attain to, or learn<lb/>
out of Books: as in its place we shall relate.<lb/>
A grave, and creditable Person told me,<lb/>
that Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant>, being very young, went<lb/>
without acquainting his Parents to the<lb/>
Kingdom of <normalised orig="Navarr" auto="false">Navarre</normalised>; where he lived six<lb/>
Years, or more with a <normalised orig="Hermite" auto="true">Hermit</normalised>; and when<lb/>
his Father seeking him very carefully at last<lb/>
found him, he brought him to <notvariant>Valladolid</notvariant>,<lb/>
where at that time the Court was: and there<lb/>
made him serve as a Page, much against his<lb/>
will. Of this I have no further certainty,<lb/>
than that I mentioned. But I understood from<lb/>
Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant> himself, that he had lived at<lb/>
<notvariant>Burgos</notvariant>, which is in the way from Madrid to<lb/>
<normalised orig="Navarr" auto="false">Navarre</normalised>: and he related concerning that City<lb/>
certain things of edification, and devotion.<lb/>
He told me also, that he had been some time<lb/>
a Page at Court: yet neither the bravery, nor<lb/>
business of the Court could make him forget<lb/>
our Lord, or that interior recollection,<lb/>
to which he found himself called. To which<lb/>
purpose I have heard him say that when<lb/>
he was sent on a message by his Lord it<lb/>
was his <normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised> care to go talking, and<lb/>
conversing mentally with God.<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="5">4</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
He likewise told me, that, when he<lb/>
came to this coast of New Spain, he had<lb/>
spent some days at our Lady's of <notvariant>Guadalupe</notvariant>,<lb/>
watching the night in prayer at that<lb/>
holy House, beseeching the <normalised orig="Perpetuall" auto="true">Perpetual</normalised><lb/>
Virgin, the Guide of Pilgrims, to obtain<lb/>
for him Light of her Blessed Son to perform<lb/>
the voyage he had designed and it is certain,<lb/>
that most merciful Virgin by a particular<lb/>
Revelation directed his voyage for<lb/>
New Spain; which course he very <normalised orig="chearfully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised><lb/>
undertook: and this matter he discoursed<lb/>
very particularly with a certain<lb/>
friend of his. He likewise told me, that,<lb/>
being one day in prayer in the holy Church<lb/>
of <notvariant>Toledo</notvariant>, he received a singular <notvariant>regalo</notvariant>,<lb/>
and favour from our Lord, the like to<lb/>
which till then he never enjoyed: and, it<lb/>
may be, it was concerning this his way, and<lb/>
that our Lord <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> him favour in it. I<lb/>
have not hitherto heard in what other<lb/>
affairs it was that he employed those first<lb/>
twenty Years of his Life.<lb/>

               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
I could never fully understand concerning<lb/>
Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant> what motives he had<lb/>
for coming into these quarters, except<lb/>
those above mentioned; though he could<lb/>
not deny to me, that the principal cause<lb/>
was the greater glory of God: who, as<lb/>
may be supposed, meant to take this his<lb/>
Servant from his country, and from amidst<lb/>
his Kindred, like another Abraham; both<lb/>
to try his faith and obedience, and to conduct<lb/>
him into the Desert, and there speak<lb/>
to him in his heart, Hos. 2. 14.<lb/>
He was some Twenty Years old when<lb/>
he arrived at the Port of S. John de <notvariant>Ulua</notvariant>:<lb/>
and in the City of <notvariant>Veracruz</notvariant>, he gave away<lb/>
in alms certain white Stuffs, he brought<lb/>
with him; which, as they assured me,<lb/>
might be to the value of about eight hundred<lb/>
Crowns. From thence he went to<lb/>
Mexico; but what befell him in that<lb/>
<normalised orig="journy" auto="true">journey</normalised> is not particularly known. Being<lb/>
come to the City, he was some <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> with<lb/>
S. Roman a Notary, and also with the<lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
Secretary <notvariant>Turcios</notvariant>, to get by his pen <notvariant>wherewith</notvariant><lb/>
to defray his charges for passing to<lb/>
<notvariant>Zacatecas</notvariant>, where he hoped to find better<lb/>
convenience for that solitary life, which<lb/>
he so desired. For the further certainty of<lb/>
this his first coming to Mexico I will produce<lb/>
a Letter, which Lewis <notvariant>Zapata</notvariant> in the<lb/>
Year 1591. writ from the Mines of <notvariant>Tasco</notvariant><lb/>
to the same Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant> to <notvariant>Sancta-Fee</notvariant>,<lb/>
where he then was. Twenty nine, or Thirty<lb/>
Years since dwelling in the street of <notvariant>Tacuba</notvariant><lb/>
in Mexico, there came a Gentleman from<lb/>
Spain, and lodged in my house, clad in<lb/>
Serge; who also fasted that Lent with bread,<lb/>
and water: he was called Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant>;<lb/>
they tell me, you also go by that name. Do me<lb/>
the favour to write, whether you be he, and<lb/>
to commend me to God, &amp;c. Gregory writ<lb/>
back in the same Letter only these words.<lb/>
I am he, <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>y*</sic>
                     <corr>you</corr>
                  </choice> mention; and will do what you<lb/>
request me. A stile, surely, very discreet,<lb/>
and so much more becoming<lb/>
Christian prudence, as it is far from those<lb/>
Complements, and superfluity of words<lb/>
wherein others spend paper, and time,<lb/>
about things of little importance.<lb/>
Gregory departed from Mexico for<lb/>
<notvariant>Zacatecas</notvariant>, not out of greediness of wealth,<lb/>
which <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> peopled those Mines with a<lb/>
multitude of inhabitants, but out of a desire<lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
of getting that pure gold of Charity,<lb/>
which our Lord Christ counsels us to buy<lb/>
of his Majesty, to make us rich. He staid<lb/>
some few days at <notvariant>Zacatecas</notvariant>, where, being<lb/>
one day in the chief Piazza of that City,<lb/>
at the time when the Waggons departed<lb/>
for Mexico with the Plate, he chanced to<lb/>
see the huge confusion, and tumults of<lb/>
Arrests, oaths, perjuries, threats, <normalised orig="quarrells" auto="true">quarrels</normalised>,<lb/>
and debates: <normalised orig="insomuch" auto="false">inasmuch</normalised> as that two<lb/>
drawing their swords at that very instant<lb/>
killed each other upon the place.<lb/>
This <normalised orig="encreased" auto="true">increased</normalised> his desire of retiring<lb/>
from the conversation of men, seeing what<lb/>
disorders, and extremities they <normalised orig="incurr" auto="true">incur</normalised><lb/>
for a <normalised orig="litle" auto="true">little</normalised> earth. And having formerly felt<lb/>
in himself a very vehement impulse, and<lb/>
clear call from our Lord to retreat to Solitude,<lb/>
he changed his costly clothes he wore,<lb/>
for a course canvas and went eight<lb/>
Leagues further into the Country, to the<lb/>
Valley of <notvariant>Amayac</notvariant>, near the <notvariant>Chichimecos</notvariant>,<lb/>
whose cruelty in those times was much<lb/>
feared by the Spaniards. But, being the<lb/>
servant of God, he went sufficiently armed<lb/>
with patience, and having begun the war<lb/>
with invisible Enemies, the <normalised orig="Infernall" auto="true">Infernal</normalised><lb/>
powers, dreaded not the visible, Men especially,<lb/>
whose inhumanity, and <normalised orig="barbarousness" auto="false">barbarisms</normalised>,<lb/>
he thought, by Gods grace,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="9">8</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
to overcome with great kindness, and<lb/>
<notvariant>condescendence</notvariant>. In this place he with his<lb/>
own hands built a <normalised orig="litle" auto="true">little</normalised> Cell, or <normalised orig="Cabbin" auto="true">Cabin</normalised>,<lb/>
wherein those very Indians assisted him,<lb/>
which <normalised orig="continueth" auto="true">continues</normalised> to this day: though<lb/>
more properly we may term it an Hermitage,<lb/>
being the first, we know of, that<lb/>
was made in New Spain. Here he began<lb/>
to lead a solitary life in his <normalised orig="entring" auto="true">entering</normalised> upon<lb/>
the one and twentieth Year of his age. The<lb/>
generous Youth then seeing himself in the<lb/>
field, or lifts, where he was to engage in<lb/>
such furious conflicts with the enemy;<lb/>
the first thing he did, was to put himself<lb/>
into the hands of God, and place himself<lb/>
under the shadow of his most <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> defence,<lb/>
and protection, using these words.<lb/>
Lord here I go forth only to serve you, and not<lb/>
to make any account at all of my self; if I<lb/>
perish, on your account be it: [and meerly<lb/>
for your sake]. By which words Gregory<lb/>
did not mean that his soul could perish<lb/>
by Gods means, he doing on his part what<lb/>
he ought, and was able: for, this <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic><normalised orig="coul" auto="true">could</normalised>*</sic>
                     <corr>could</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
not be imagined of a person, naturally, adorned<lb/>
with so great an understanding;<lb/>
and, <notvariant>supernaturally</notvariant>, endowed with so<lb/>
much light. But by this manner of speech<lb/>
he expressed a heart wholly resigned to<lb/>
God, and <normalised orig="enflamed" auto="true">inflamed</normalised> with the love of his<lb/>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
Honour, that on his account, and <normalised orig="meerly" auto="true">merely</normalised><lb/>
for his service, not his own, he came<lb/>
thither, and on the same account, if so<lb/>
was his Divine pleasure, there would<lb/>
perish.<lb/>
From the very instant that Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant><lb/>
made this Act, he found the favour of our<lb/>
Lord very present with him, and began to<lb/>
walk with great courage in the <normalised orig="narow" auto="false">narrow</normalised> path<lb/>
to Perfection: wherein he went not a step<lb/>
back, nor ever stopped, nor lost sight of that<lb/>
light, and clarity, <notvariant>wherewith</notvariant> God guided<lb/>
him in this way. He armed himself with<lb/>
austerities, and <notvariant>mortifications</notvariant> of his Body;<lb/>
which he macerated with <normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="abstinences" auto="false">abstinences</normalised>: for, he used to eat but once<lb/>
a day, though his meal were but short, &amp;<lb/>
of little nourishment: (the most of his<lb/>
time, it was only Indian <notvariant>Maiz</notvariant> or wheat<lb/>
parched, with the Indians call <notvariant>Cacalote</notvariant>).<lb/>
And this custom he observed with such <normalised orig="rigor" auto="true">rigour</normalised><lb/>
to <choice ana="print">

                  </choice>, that on no occasion, though<lb/>
of dangerous sickness, he ever left it off:<lb/>
He never eat flesh. If they sent him in alms<lb/>
some slices of Beef, he thankfully received<lb/>
them, disguising his abstinence, but eat<lb/>
them not. His ordinary bread was little<lb/>
cakes of <notvariant>Maiz</notvariant>. He suffered some affronts<lb/>
from the Spanish <normalised orig="souldiers" auto="true">soldiers</normalised>, that passed that<lb/>

likewise his suffering inconveniences, and<lb/>
want of necessaries afforded him occasion<lb/>
of meriting; yet all this was pleasant in<lb/>
comparison of the Interior Exercise,<lb/>
<notvariant>wherewith</notvariant> our Lord continually tried<lb/>
him. And though in particular he told me<lb/>

                  <lb/>
not, in what kind, or way this Exercise,<lb/>

                     <corr>assured</corr>

the violence of the Combat was such, that<lb/>
he admired how he had been able to persevere,<lb/>
and that his hair stood an end,<lb/>
when he <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised> those times. This he<lb/>
said being now an old <normalised orig="Souldier" auto="true">Soldier</normalised> and much<lb/>
experienced in such assaults. Upon an occasion<lb/>
that offered it self he, though very<lb/>
modestly, told a Confident of his, that he<lb/>
had a hot skirmish with the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, and<lb/>
came to a <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> grappling with him;<lb/>
and such was the contention, that therein<lb/>
the blood burst out at his ears, and <normalised orig="nostrills" auto="false">nostrils</normalised>.<lb/>
The remedy, he used on such occasions,<lb/>
was prayer, wherein he persevered night,<lb/>
and day: and it was but necessary, for his<lb/>
not yielding to his Enemy, to employ all<lb/>
his strength in requesting it. Now, among<lb/>
the sentiments which our Lord for his<lb/>
support, and consolation, gave him in<lb/>
Prayer, there was one very singular in<lb/>
these words: <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 6.10">
                     <lb/>
                     Fiat <notvariant>voluntas</notvariant> <notvariant>tua</notvariant>, <notvariant>sicut</notvariant> in<lb/>

                     <lb/>
                  </quote> Amen, Jesus. Which he<lb/>
repeated continually; so that for the space<lb/>
of three Years every time he breathed, he<lb/>
uttered them mentally at each respiration,<lb/>
without failing, or forgetting himself:<lb/>
nor did either eating, or drinking, or discoursing<lb/>
with any make him <notvariant>intermit</notvariant> this<lb/>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
Exercise. And, I asking him if he could<lb/>
possibly remember those words, when he<lb/>
first <normalised orig="awaked" auto="false">awoke</normalised>; he answered me, Yes: and<lb/>
that, so duly, that being awake, he breathed<lb/>
not a second time, before he called<lb/>
them to mind. A thing very strange indeed,<lb/>
yet not impossible to Gregory, as<lb/>
<normalised orig="suting" auto="true">suiting</normalised> with the great vigilance, and constancy,<lb/>
which our Lord gave him in all<lb/>
that, which he represented to him, to be<lb/>
the divine Will, and advantageous for<lb/>
his Soul.<lb/>
At the end of three Years, wherein he<lb/>
exercised himself in the meditating, and<lb/>
ruminating on the <normalised orig="forementioned" auto="false">aforementioned</normalised> words,<lb/>
finding himself much improved thereby,<lb/>
and greatly conformed to the Will of<lb/>
God, in whatsoever his Majesty thought<lb/>
fit to ordain concerning him, the same<lb/>
Lord was pleased to put him upon another<lb/>
Exercise, not so much of words, as<lb/>
works, which was an ardent Love of<lb/>
God, and his Neighbours, wherein that<lb/>
religious Soul <normalised orig="setled" auto="true">settled</normalised> it self, as in a <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised><lb/>
the most <notvariant>heroical</notvariant> and most acceptable<lb/>
to our Lord. Supported with so solid, and<lb/>

AT the same hour that Gregory died,<lb/>
a Religious Woman, much exercised<lb/>
in <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised> and the way of<lb/>
interior living, with whom the Holy Man<lb/>
communicated in the union of Spiritual<lb/>
Life, being in Prayer <normalised orig="absorpt" auto="true">absorbed</normalised> in Spirit,<lb/>
saw Him come toward her, saying these<lb/>
words: Sister, I am going to Heaven; you<lb/>
shall not go so soon, because your presence <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*s</sic>

                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
necessary for the service of God, and comfort<lb/>
of this Convent: And so he instantly<lb/>
disappeared, leaving her soul much edified,<lb/>
and fully resigned to the will of God;<lb/>
though her desires were to be loosed<lb/>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
from her mortal flesh, and be with Christ.<lb/>
She, before the news came to Mexico of<lb/>
Gregory <notvariant>Lopez's</notvariant> death, imparted this<lb/>
Revelation to her Confessor; who, certified<lb/>
of the truth of it, counselled the said<lb/>
party to conceal what had been revealed<lb/>
to her, till God should declare what was<lb/>
to be done. He also advised her, by using<lb/>
more prayer, to try whether this<lb/>
Spirit were of God, or some evil Angel.<lb/>
Twelve days after she told her Confessor,<lb/>
it was our Lords will, she should reveal<lb/>
this to me; because I had enquired concerning<lb/>
what had passed. And these<lb/>
words also were spoken to her from the<lb/>
mouth of her Heavenly Spouse Jesus<lb/>
Christ: Wherefore, <normalised orig="thinkest" auto="true">think</normalised> thou, is Gregory<lb/>
seated near unto me? But because,<lb/>
for me, he forsook all the temporal things of<lb/>
this life, and lived with inward Recollection,<lb/>
and silence.<lb/>
I was told by a Religious Woman, of<lb/>
whose <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised> and Spirit I am much satisfied,<lb/>
that some five years before the<lb/>
Death of Gregory as she lay on her Bed<lb/>
after Prime (because at that time she was<lb/>
sick) our Lord in her sleep <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> her<lb/>
the Heaven open, out of which went in<lb/>
Procession all the Religious Orders, and<lb/>
divers Martyrs, and likewise the B. Virgin<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="75">74</fw>
                  <pb n="16"/>
                  <lb/>
our Lady, with many Women-Saints,<lb/>
and Christ our Lord with his Apostles;<lb/>
she wondering <notvariant>thereat</notvariant>, it was told her,<lb/>
they went to visit the holy Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant><lb/>
who was sick. <normalised orig="Afterward" auto="false">Afterwards</normalised> she heard<lb/>
that he was then like to <normalised orig="dy" auto="true">die</normalised>, and in five<lb/>
days he had not eat a bit.<lb/>
A Person, whose <normalised orig="wisdome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised>, <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised>, and<lb/>
humility is very well known to all, out of<lb/>
an affection of devotion, and love which<lb/>
he bare to the holy Man, desired him a<lb/>
few days before his Death to remember<lb/>
him; he promised, he would. And, the<lb/>
first Saturday-Night after his death he<lb/>
saw in his sleep a Vision, <notvariant>wherewith</notvariant> he <normalised orig="awaked" auto="false">awoke</normalised>,<lb/>
and perceived it was the shape of<lb/>
Holy Gregory, whose blessed Soul united<lb/>
it self to the body of this person, and<lb/>
with very great Jubilee made him bless<lb/>
and praise God in his Saints, and especially<lb/>
in the Holy Confessor Gregory. This<lb/>
passed a while; and he composed again<lb/>
to rest with much joy and consolation<lb/>
felt himself again touched all over his<lb/>
body; and, being <normalised orig="awaked" auto="false">awoke</normalised>, a second time<lb/>
that appearance of Gregory <normalised orig="seizeth" auto="true">seizes</normalised> him,<lb/>
moving him extraordinarily, and urging<lb/>
him to praise God, without his deliberating<lb/>
thereon, or being able for an instant<lb/>
to cease. It likewise made him <normalised orig="discerne" auto="true">discern</normalised>,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="76">75</fw>
                  <pb n="17"/>
                  <lb/>
and confess, how unworthy he was of<lb/>
such a favour, and how much obliged to<lb/>
serve God, and render thanks for that<lb/>
Visit of his faithful Friend.<lb/>
A Servant of God, of approved <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised>,<lb/>
(whom our Lord instructs, and encourages<lb/>
by frequent <normalised orig="Extasies" auto="true">Ecstasies</normalised>, and<lb/>
<notvariant>Rapts</notvariant>) being one day, ten years before<lb/>
Gregory died, tortured and full of pain,<lb/>
inwardly recollecting himself he began to<lb/>
contemplate the sublimity of <notvariant>Gregory's</notvariant><lb/>
Spirit. And, being rapt in spirit by this<lb/>
consideration, there was represented to<lb/>
the eyes of his mind an Image so Crystalline<lb/>
and transparent, as he might see<lb/>
through it; and it was told him, Such is<lb/>
the Soul of Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant>. At which<lb/>
he <normalised orig="wondred" auto="true">wondered</normalised> and rejoiced exceedingly,<lb/>
telling it to Gregory, who answered him<lb/>
not a word.<lb/>
A certain Religious Man, that led a<lb/>
Spiritual life, much addicted to Prayer,<lb/>
as he was praying once in the Quire, receiving<lb/>
from God by <notvariant>Gregory's</notvariant> intercession<lb/>
such a clear knowledge of his nothingness,<lb/>
as much edifies all that converse<lb/>
with him, and likewise such a great<lb/>
love of God, and union with his Divine<lb/>
Majesty, that, it being about two<lb/>
Months since he received this favour, he<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="77">76</fw>

                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> never discontinued this Union, but<lb/>
persevered in one continued Act thereof.<lb/>
A certain Priest, much affected with<lb/>
the <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> and Spirit of this Holy Man,<lb/>
and who had great hopes of being assisted<lb/>
in the presence of God by his Prayer,<lb/>
thinking once on Gregory (who died a<lb/>
little before) and on his happy condition,<lb/>
and how prevalent with God he<lb/>
was, was bid in his sleep, Ask, ask;<lb/>
and in obedience to the direction he asked<lb/>
our Lord a thing which, till then, he<lb/>
could never obtain. And presently the<lb/>
same day it was granted him: and by this<lb/>
means he procured other things, not for<lb/>
himself only, but also for others.<lb/>
Another man, one spiritual and devout,<lb/>
who was wont to come and ask<lb/>
counsel of Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant>, desiring the<lb/>
same likewise after his death, it was said<lb/>
to him: Judge not thy Neighbours, and be<lb/>
more Temperate. <notvariant>Wherewith</notvariant>, he told<lb/>
me, he received considerable benefit in<lb/>
his Soul.<lb/>
Many other things, like these, our<lb/>

the great glory, with which his Divine<lb/>

                  </choice>, and some few hours after <normalised orig="awaked" auto="false">awoke</normalised>,<lb/>
                  <pb n="22"/>
                  <lb/>
took the Breast, and was well.<lb/>
His Parents and those that were present<lb/>
gave great thanks to God, and the Saint,<lb/>
for this Miracle.<lb/>
In the same City was a Priest in such<lb/>
extreme pain with the <normalised orig="Toothach" auto="false">Toothache</normalised>, that for<lb/>
three days and nights he could not rest<lb/>
one minute, and by its violence his face<lb/>
was much swelled. His Mother gave<lb/>
him a piece of <notvariant>Gregory's</notvariant> garment, which<lb/>
he with faith and devotion applied to his<lb/>
Cheek, and presently fell into a sleep,<lb/>
which continued from Nine <normalised orig="a-clock" auto="false">o'clock</normalised> that<lb/>
night till morning, and awaking found<lb/>
his face without either swelling, or pain:<lb/>
attributing so sudden a recovery to the<lb/>
Holy man's intercession, and rendering<lb/>
for it thanks to our Lord.<lb/>
In the house of a Gentleman of Mexico,<lb/>
a person well known in the Kingdom,<lb/>
there befell a Slave of his such an unexpected<lb/>
accident and sad misfortune, that,<lb/>
by reason of a fit he had, all present took<lb/>
him for dead. A Gentlewoman that<lb/>
was by, <normalised orig="remembring" auto="true">remembering</normalised> that she had in her<lb/>
custody a piece of the Shirt in which<lb/>
Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant> died, (given her by me)<lb/>
sent for a little Casket, and, taking out<lb/>
the said <normalised orig="Relique" auto="true">Relic</normalised>, she laid it on the infirm<lb/>
Man's forehead, and <normalised orig="immediatly" auto="true">immediately</normalised> he came<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="82">G</fw>
                  <pb n="23"/>
                  <lb/>
to himself, perfectly well, though exceedingly<lb/>
bruised; and being asked, what<lb/>
he felt, he answered, Nothing. All that<lb/>
saw the passage with its particular circumstances<lb/>
could not but ascribe this<lb/>
cure to a Miracle, which our Lord<lb/>
wrought by his Servant Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant>.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
In the City de los Angeles an Honourable<lb/>
Lady was near the point of death by<lb/>
the <notvariant>Meazils</notvariant> that befell her nigh her time<lb/>
of lying in, the Infant being dead in her<lb/>
Womb. Her Husband, seeing her in<lb/>
such danger, <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised> a Brother of the<lb/>
Convalescents, called John <notvariant>Vallcio</notvariant>, to go<lb/>
visit her. He went, and took with him<lb/>
a piece of <notvariant>Gregory's</notvariant> garment, and, applying<lb/>
it to the sick party's neck, said to<lb/>
her: Madam, trust in God; for his Servant<lb/>
Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant> will obtain your recovery;<lb/>
and bear great reverence to this his<lb/>
<normalised orig="Relique" auto="true">Relic</normalised>; as it seems, she did: for, being<lb/>
safe delivered, she was presently well.<lb/>
The said Brother in the same Town applied<lb/>
that same <normalised orig="Relique" auto="true">Relic</normalised> to a sick Woman,<lb/>
who a long time had such terrible pains in<lb/>
her head, that she cried out continually<lb/>
night and day; wishing her to put great<lb/>
confidence in our Lord, that by the merits<lb/>
of Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant> he would give her<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="83">82</fw>
                  <pb n="24"/>
                  <lb/>
health. His Majesty presently did so: and<lb/>
she was very thankful to God, and<lb/>
devout to him, who by his intercession<lb/>
had freed her from so excessive pain.<lb/>
In the City of <notvariant>Tlaxcala</notvariant> a Young man<lb/>
had a miserable Leprosy, and having tried<lb/>
divers, and spent much in order to his<lb/>
cure in vain, a Brother of the Convalescents<lb/>
gave him a piece of <notvariant>Gregory's</notvariant> garment,<lb/>
bidding him apply it to his neck,<lb/>
and take this Servant of God for his Advocate,<lb/>
with great confidence of his recovery.<lb/>
And within eight days space he<lb/>
grew well, and quit from his Leprosy<lb/>
divulged this Miracle, publishing with<lb/>
signal gratitude the wonders of God, and<lb/>
the praises of Gregory.<lb/>
In a Village of this <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> (called<lb/>
<notvariant>Hihualapa</notvariant>) a Gentleman for Sixteen<lb/>
Months was tortured extremely with<lb/>
the <normalised orig="Colick" auto="true">Colic</normalised>, without being free one day<lb/>
or hour in all that time; yea, the last<lb/>
twenty days, his pain left him not one<lb/>
minute. A Gentlewoman happened to<lb/>
be present, Wife to the Chief Justice of<lb/>
that Province, who told him, she had<lb/>
seen wonderful things done by the devotion<lb/>
those in her house bare to the holy<lb/>
Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant>; and, if he, with like faith,<lb/>
took him for an Intercessor to the Divine<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="84">G2</fw>
                  <pb n="25"/>
                  <lb/>
Goodness, he might be confident of<lb/>
health. The Sick Man hearing this took<lb/>
a piece of <notvariant>Gregory's</notvariant> Shirt; applying it to<lb/>
the place where his pain was sharpest,<lb/>
and, holding it there a little while, presently<lb/>
voided a stone of the bigness of an<lb/>
ordinary Pine-kernel. Hereupon he recovered,<lb/>
never after feeling the <normalised orig="foresaid" auto="false">aforesaid</normalised><lb/>
pain, and held it for certain, that this<lb/>
favour and cure was granted him by the<lb/>
merits and intercession of Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant>,<lb/>
to whom he continued very devout and<lb/>
grateful.<lb/>
A Brother of the Convalescents, called<lb/>
<notvariant>Alonso</notvariant> de la <notvariant>Fuente</notvariant>, was six years in the<lb/>
Hospital of <notvariant>Guasteca</notvariant>, almost continually<lb/>
sick, full of <normalised orig="plaisters" auto="true">plasters</normalised>, and both legs having<lb/>
ulcers running upon them. The<lb/>
Chief Brother seeing him thus helpless,<lb/>
and that, besides these and other indispositions<lb/>
&amp; pains, there rise in his forehead a<lb/>
knob or swelling as big as an egg, and another<lb/>
in his ankle, little less, both very<lb/>
painful, he removed him to the Hospital<lb/>
in the Island of S. John de <notvariant>Ulua</notvariant>, conceiving<lb/>
that, it being a hotter Climate, he<lb/>
might recover there. It fell out quite<lb/>
contrary; for, by reason of the moisture<lb/>
from the Sea, and the cold of the <notvariant>Northwinds</notvariant>,<lb/>
he grew much worse. This Brother<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="85">84</fw>
                  <pb n="26"/>
                  <lb/>
being one day extreme sad and troubled,<lb/>
recommending himself to our Lord,<lb/>
and his Saints, earnestly besought the<lb/>
Servant of God Gregory <notvariant>Lopez</notvariant> to procure<lb/>
him his health; and recalling to mind<lb/>
certain <normalised orig="Reliques" auto="true">Relics</normalised> of his given him at <notvariant>Guastepa</notvariant>,<lb/>
he applied them to his head with<lb/>
a night-cap, and to his leg with bands,<lb/>
and taking off the <normalised orig="plaisters" auto="true">plasters</normalised> and patches,<lb/>
he wore, threw them into the Sea; and<lb/>
within three or four days, after he had<lb/>
applied the said <normalised orig="Reliques" auto="true">Relics</normalised>, without any<lb/>
other medicine, he found himself perfectly<lb/>
cured of his Maladies, swellings,<lb/>
and pains, which never troubled him<lb/>
more. Whereby he plainly perceived,<lb/>
the intercession of this his great Servant<lb/>
was very powerful with God.<lb/>
