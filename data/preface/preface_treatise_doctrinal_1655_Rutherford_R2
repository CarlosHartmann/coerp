Christian Reader,<lb/>
                  <lb/>
MAny have written to the edifying of the <lb/>
godly, of this excellent Subject: Its not <lb/>
much I can <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> in this, but have added <lb/>
some thoughts to what is said, intending a <lb/>
more <normalised orig="Practicall" auto="true">Practical</normalised> way of the last Point in another <lb/>
Treatise, to wit, of the application <lb/>
of Covenant-Promises, and of the influences <lb/>
of the <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>S*irit</sic>
                     <corr>Spirit</corr>
                  </choice> under the Covenant of <lb/>
Grace, of which, especially of the latter of these two, few have <lb/>
Practically written: And it is of much concernment, to make out <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Vnion" auto="true">Union</normalised> of our Duty, and the breathings of the Lord, and what <lb/>
can be done under <normalised orig="deadnesse" auto="true">deadness</normalised>, to either fetch the wind, or to be put <lb/>
in a <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> condition, that the soul may <normalised orig="lye" auto="true">lie</normalised> fair for the receiving <lb/>
of the influences of God. I desire in this to <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>sp*ak</sic>
                     <corr>speak</corr>
                  </choice> for Truth, not either <lb/>
for or against persons of whom I am silent, concealing the <lb/>
names of any Contradicent, judging Truth so much the more desirable, <lb/>
when it may <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>p*ss*bly</sic>
                     <corr>possibly</corr>
                  </choice> be had with Peace, and as little blowing <lb/>
or stirring of the fire of contradiction as can be. What is here <lb/>
said in a way of Disputing, the Moderate Reader, who is not taken <lb/>
with that way, may <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> by and read what is <normalised orig="practicall" auto="true">practical</normalised>. The <lb/>
Author <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been (lest Truth should suffer by him) a little <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">* 2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="darkned" auto="true">darkened</normalised>, as report bears, with the name, I know not what, of a Protester, <lb/>
as one who <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> deserted the Government and Discipline <lb/>
of the Church of God in Scotland; But my humble thoughts are <lb/>
the same they were before, though I can add nothing to the Truth. <lb/>
I look on these men the world so names Protesters, <normalised orig="Schismaticks" auto="true">Schismatics</normalised>, <lb/>
Separatists, as <normalised orig="sinfull" auto="true">sinful</normalised> men, who stand in need of a Saviour, and <lb/>
as such as desire to fear God and love His Name, and would gladly <lb/>
have our practice, and walk come a little more near to the Rule of <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Gospell" auto="true">Gospel</normalised>, and that our Land might mourn for all the abominations <lb/>
committed therein, which I desire to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> spoken without any <lb/>
reflection upon any of the godly in the Land, who in that point, are <lb/>
of another <normalised orig="Iudgement" auto="true">Judgment</normalised>. It is my desire to the Lord, that he would <lb/>
let us hear experiencedly the reality of that: <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 65.8">Thus saith the <lb/>
Lord, As the new wine is found in a <normalised orig="clustre" auto="true">cluster</normalised>, and one saith, <lb/>
Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it: so will I <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> for my servants <lb/>
sake, that I may not destroy them all.</quote> The Lord Jesus <lb/>
be with your Spirit. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Yours in the Lord Jesus, <lb/>
S. R.<lb/>
