               <head>TO THE <lb/>
Noble <notvariant>Bereans</notvariant> <lb/>
Of ThIS AGE.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
WHen our dear Lord Jesus Christ, <lb/>
the Blessed Author of the <lb/>
Christian-Religion, first sent forth his Disciples, <lb/>
to proclaim the Happy Approach of <lb/>
the Heavenly Kingdom, among several other <lb/>
Things that he gave them in Charge, it <lb/>
<normalised orig="pleas'd" auto="true">pleased</normalised> him to make this One of their Instructions; <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 10.11">Into whatsoever City or Town <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> <lb/>
shall enter, enquire who in it is Worthy</quote>; <lb/>
fore-seeing the ill <normalised orig="Vse" auto="true">Use</normalised> <normalised orig="Vnworthy" auto="true">Unworthy</normalised> Persons <lb/>
would make of that Message, and with what <lb/>
<normalised orig="Vnweariedness" auto="false">unwearidness</normalised> the implacable Pharisee and <lb/>
<normalised orig="subtil" auto="true">subtle</normalised> Scribe would endeavour to Pervert the <lb/>
Right Way of the Lord, and thereby prejudice <lb/>
the Simple against the Reception of <lb/>
that Excellent Testimony. <lb/>
This being our Case, who above every <lb/>
Tribe of Men are most Maliciously Represented, <lb/>
Bitterly Envied, and Furiously <normalised orig="Oppugn'd" auto="false">Oppugned</normalised> <lb/>
by many of the Scribes and Pharisees <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
of our Time, for as Impious Wretches as <lb/>
Those of that, reputed our Blessed Saviour <lb/>
and his Constant Followers, it <normalised orig="becometh" auto="true">becomes</normalised> <lb/>
us in a Condition so desperate, to provide our <lb/>
selves with some Worthy Readers, Men that <lb/>
dare trust their Reason above Reports, and <lb/>
be Impartial in an Age as <normalised orig="byass'd" auto="true">biased</normalised> as this we <lb/>
live in; whose Determinations shall not wait <lb/>
upon the Sentence of Ignorance nor Interest, <lb/>
but a Sincere and Punctual Examen of the <lb/>
Matter. <lb/>
And since there are None recorded in <lb/>
Sacred Writ, on whom the Holy Ghost <normalised orig="conferr'd" auto="true">conferred</normalised> <lb/>
so Honourable a Character, as the <notvariant>Bereans</notvariant> <lb/>
of that Age (for that they both searched <lb/>
after Truth impartially, and when they <lb/>
found it, <normalised orig="imbraced" auto="true">embraced</normalised> it readily) for which they <lb/>
were <normalised orig="entituled" auto="true">entitled</normalised> Noble) Therefore it is <lb/>
that to you, the Progeny of that Worthy <lb/>
Stock, and Noble <notvariant>Bereans</notvariant> of our Age, <lb/>
We, the so much Calumniated Abettors of <lb/>
the Cause of Truth, choose to dedicate this <lb/>
Defence of our Holy Profession from the <lb/>
Injurious Practices of a sort of Men, who <lb/>
not unlike to the Jews of Thessalonica, that, <lb/>
Envying the Prosperity of the Gospel among <lb/>
your Ancestors, made it their Business to stir <lb/>
up the Multitude against the Zealous Promoters <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
of it. And no Matter what it be, <lb/>
provided they can but Obtain their End of <lb/>
fixing an Odium upon the Quakers: They <lb/>
do not only boldly condemn what they esteem <lb/>
Worst in us (how deservedly we will not <lb/>
now say) but slyly insinuate what is Best, to <lb/>
be Criminal. <lb/>
The Sobriety of our Lives, they call <lb/>
a Cheat for Custom; and our Incessant <lb/>
Preachings and Holy Living, a Decoy <lb/>
to Advance our Party: If we say Nothing <lb/>
to them when they interrogate us, <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> Sullenness <lb/>
or Inability; if we say Something to <lb/>
them, it is Impertinency or Equivocation: <lb/>
We must not believe as we do believe, but as <lb/>
they would have us believe, which they are <lb/>
sure to make obnoxious enough, that they <lb/>
may the more securely bait us for it; Nor <lb/>
must our Writings mean what we say we <lb/>
mean by them, but what they will have them <lb/>
to mean, lest they should want Proofs for <lb/>
their Charges. It was our very Case that <lb/>
put David upon that sad Complaint, <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 56.5">Every <lb/>
day they Wrest my Words, all their <lb/>
Thoughts are against me for Evil</quote>; But <lb/>
to David's God we commit our <normalised orig="Slander'd" auto="true">Slandered</normalised> <lb/>
Cause, and to you the <notvariant>Bereans</notvariant> of our <lb/>
Age.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 2</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
Degenerate not from the Example of <lb/>
your Progenitors; if you do, you are no longer <lb/>
True <notvariant>Bereans</notvariant>, and to such only we inscribe <lb/>
this Work; if you do not, we may assure <lb/>
our selves of the Justice of a Fair Enquiry <lb/>
and an Equal Judgment. <lb/>
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus <lb/>
Christ augment your Desire after Truth, <lb/>
give you clearer Discerning of the Truth, <lb/>
and enable you both more readily to receive, <lb/>
and with greater Resolution to maintain <lb/>
the Truth. We are<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Your greatly <normalised orig="Traduc'd" auto="true">Traduced</normalised>, but <lb/>
truly Christian Friends, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
William Penn, <lb/>
George Whitehead. <lb/>
