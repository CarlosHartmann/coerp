To the Reader.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Reader, <lb/>
IT <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="bin" auto="true">been</normalised> my constant Course for some Months, to Preach every Sunday <lb/>
either on the whole Epistle for the Day, or some part of it. And <lb/>
finding I was commanded in the Brief for the Persecuted Protestants <lb/>
in France, (which was brought me in the Week before the 4<hi rend="high">th</hi>. Sunday <lb/>
in Lent) to publish it the next Sunday; I found there was no <lb/>
need to alter my wonted course, in order to my pitching on a Subject which <lb/>
might suit with that Occasion. The famous Dr. Patrick in his Epistle Dedicatory <lb/>
before his Sermon Preached before the Lord Major, &amp;c. the 21<hi rend="high">st</hi>. <lb/>
Sunday after Trinity 1680. ascribes his being directed to the Subject he <lb/>
then Preached on, not so much to his own Prudence, as a kind of Divine <lb/>
Providence; because having observed this same Course that Year, he did <lb/>
not on that Occasion go out of his way to meet with a fitting Argument. <lb/>
Whether People will put the same Construction on this Discourse or <lb/>
not, I neither know nor care. But I think I may truly say, I have discoursed <lb/>
on this Text, with a Freedom which becomes a Christian, and particularly <lb/>
a true Son of the Church of England.<lb/>
It may be some who pretend to the Church, will take Exception at this <lb/>
Sermon, for there are some so shallow, and of so short Discourse, they <lb/>
cannot understand how a man can except against their violent Proceedings <lb/>
against some Dissenters, and yet he himself a thorough Conformist. Indeed <lb/>
it is not of any moment what such may either say or think, but yet to <lb/>
give them some Satisfaction, if they ever happen to be favoured with any sober <lb/>
and lucid Intervals, I will amongst the many Instances I might mention <lb/>
for this end, offer these few to their Consideration. <lb/>
1. I could never yet understand that Conformity did oblige any man to <lb/>
lay aside all Bowels of Compassion. Nay I am sure, to Convince and Satisfy <lb/>
Men with Reason, and by Humility, Gentleness, and Meekness is most <lb/>
Christian, and tends most to the Honour of particular Persons, and whole <lb/>
Churches. How much of Fierceness and Violence there is in any Party, especially <lb/>
if countenanced by the Principles of that <normalised orig="Perswasion" auto="true">Persuasion</normalised>, so much there is <lb/>
of some Infernal and Devilish Mixture in it.<lb/>
2. Those who do generally Decry and Prosecute Dissenters with greatest <lb/>
Passion and Virulence, are greatest Strangers unto them. They usually know <lb/>
no more of them, than they learn from some false and scandalous Observator <lb/>
or other.<lb/>
3. They are commonly Ignorant of the State of the Controversy betwixt <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
us, and the Dissenters. The true Reason, why Judicious and thinking <lb/>
Conformists do use those particular Ceremonies which are <normalised orig="enjoyned" auto="true">enjoined</normalised>, is <lb/>
because they are satisfied they come under the general Rule given by the Apostle, <lb/>
viz. that all things be done decently and in order. And the Reason <lb/>
why they observe no other Rites and Ceremonies, (<normalised orig="whil'st" auto="true">whilst</normalised> it must be acknowledged <lb/>
there are others every whit as orderly and decently in themselves <lb/>
as these) is because, these alone are <normalised orig="enjoyned" auto="true">enjoined</normalised> by an Authority, they are <lb/>
<normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised>, has Power to interpose in these things. And now if others do <lb/>
not break the general Rule given by the Apostle, but apprehend that a Freedom <lb/>
from Impositions in these things, is one part of the Liberty they are commanded <lb/>
to stand fast in, why should we quarrel with, and prosecute them?<lb/>
especially <normalised orig="whil'st" auto="true">whilst</normalised> they <normalised orig="acknowledg" auto="true">acknowledge</normalised> that it pertains to Authority to take notice <lb/>
of them who are Indecent, and Disorderly in their Worship. Is it not enough <lb/>
that we may act according to our own more minute <normalised orig="Perswasion" auto="true">Persuasion</normalised>, and have <lb/>
the Countenance and <normalised orig="Incouragement" auto="true">Encouragement</normalised> of those in Power, but we must <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised> and <lb/>
oppress them who will not truckle to our Fancies?<lb/>
4. I have had the Opportunity to be acquainted both with Conformists, <lb/>
and Nonconformists. And as I <normalised orig="acknowledg" auto="true">acknowledge</normalised> I have great cause to bless <lb/>
God for the worthy <normalised orig="Labors" auto="true">Labours</normalised>, and exemplary Lives of very many in the <lb/>
Church of England, so I ought to give others their due. And this I must <lb/>
say, that those of the Dissenters whom I have <normalised orig="bin" auto="true">been</normalised> acquainted with, have <lb/>
<normalised orig="bin" auto="true">been</normalised> men of great Learning, exemplary Piety, strict Devotion, and extraordinary <lb/>
Loyalty. Men who have <normalised orig="bin" auto="true">been</normalised> diligent Attenders on God in his <lb/>
<normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Ordinances, eminently Religious in their Families, who have had a <lb/>
great regard to Conscience in all the parts of their Conversation with Men. <lb/>
They have neither <normalised orig="bin" auto="true">been</normalised> Haunters of Taverns, nor obscene and loose in their <lb/>
Discourse, nor have they <normalised orig="bin" auto="true">been</normalised> guilty of sitting Days and Nights at Cards <lb/>
and Dice. Indeed they have <normalised orig="bin" auto="true">been</normalised> Persons that could not be justly blamed <lb/>
for any thing, but that they had straighter Notions concerning humane <lb/>
Impositions in the Service of God, than we Conformists have.<lb/>
And a very learned Gentleman has upon Consideration given a very just <lb/>
and good Reason of this. He <normalised orig="expresseth" auto="true">expresses</normalised> himself in these Words. I think <lb/>
this their Scrupulosity may be of God, and that some men are by him <lb/>
framed to it, that he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> provided it as a Bar and Obstacle in the <lb/>
Natures and Complexions of some devout Men, against any Innovations <lb/>
whatsoever, that dangerous ones may not steal upon the <lb/>
Church, for the better maintaining the Simplicity and Purity of <lb/>
Christian Religion and Worship.<lb/>
If after all this, any remain unsatisfied, they may seek Satisfaction where <lb/>
they please, for <choice ana="illegible">
