THE<lb/>
PUBLISHER<lb/>
To the Courteous<lb/>
READER.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
TO be tedious in Prefacing <lb/>
where the Work is so short, <lb/>
would be prejudicial both to <lb/>
the Author that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> studied, and the <lb/>
Reader that delights in brevity: Yet <lb/>
because the world is grown to such a <lb/>
frame, that little (though never so <lb/>
excellent) is now respected, if not <lb/>
commended, accept a word or two. <lb/>
The subject cannot but please any <lb/>
who is cordially affected to approve <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
himself to God and the world, by <lb/>
walking in all godliness and honesty: <lb/>
To live, is the desire of the creature; <lb/>
to live to sin, of a sensual and corrupt <lb/>
creature; to live unto God, of <lb/>
a new creature: If Christ be in us <lb/>
we are new creatures, and so shall <lb/>
daily be renewed in strength and <lb/>
grace, till we attain to that state <lb/>
where old things shall utterly vanish. <lb/>
Among others, take this little Treatise, <lb/>
attend to it, and in these giddy <lb/>
times, wherein poor souls seem to be <lb/>
bewitched and led captive with the <lb/>
enticing words of <normalised orig="Mens" auto="true">Men's</normalised> Doctrines, <lb/>
thou <normalised orig="mayest" auto="true">may</normalised> have a direction to lead <lb/>
thee toward thine end, the enjoyment <lb/>
of God. <lb/>
Touching the Author, though he <lb/>
be far above my commendation, or <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
the worlds usual expectation; yet, <lb/>
lest the ignorance of him should prejudice <lb/>
his worth, and so the benefit of <lb/>
his <normalised orig="Labors" auto="true">Labours</normalised>, Honesty requires me to <lb/>
speak what Modesty justly denies <lb/>
him to publish. Where he is he is <lb/>
eminent <normalised orig="honorable" auto="true">honourable</normalised> among the Worthies; <lb/>
yea (without injury to any) <lb/>
one of the chief. Whosoever reads <lb/>
this (which is but a piece of him) let <lb/>
him, if he can, justly deny his abilities <lb/>
and learning. If any fall out with <lb/>
his Opinion concerning Church-power, <lb/>
let him, before he censure, read his <lb/>
Answer to Apollonius in <normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised>, <lb/>
and then if he be not fully satisfied, <lb/>
let him censure on, or disprove it if <lb/>
he can, and let the Author have his <lb/>
Plea to make it good, and then let the <lb/>
world judge who <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> the best. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 3</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
To trouble thee no farther, as <lb/>
there are diversities of subjects, so <lb/>
there are diversities of gifts, that <lb/>
every one whose eye is to heaven, <lb/>
may have somewhat spoken suitable <lb/>
to his own heart: It may be what <lb/>
satisfaction thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> missed elsewhere, <lb/>
thou <normalised orig="mayest" auto="true">may</normalised> receive here. Read <lb/>
thou, and God give thee understanding <lb/>
in all things. <lb/>
