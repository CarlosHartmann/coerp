                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
TO MY <lb/>
<normalised orig="Welbeloved" auto="true">Well-beloved</normalised> FRIENDS <lb/>
THE <lb/>
PARISHIONERS <lb/>
OF <lb/>
St. Paul Covent Garden. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
THere being a solemn Vow upon you, <lb/>
made in <normalised orig="Baptisme" auto="true">Baptism</normalised>, to keep Gods <lb/>
holy will and Commandments; <lb/>
it is as necessary to understand <lb/>
them, as it is to be honest men, and <lb/>
not to <normalised orig="falsifie" auto="true">falsify</normalised> or break your word. For <lb/>
an help therefore to the meanest capacities in a business <lb/>
of such importance, I have drawn up an exposition <lb/>
of the Ten Commandments in this plain <lb/>
and familiar way of Questions and Answers: not <lb/>
knowing what other course to take that would be of <lb/>
such general use. For the Ignorant can reap little <lb/>
benefit by that which is purposely contrived to the <lb/>
pitch of the wise; but there is no man of such understanding <lb/>
that may not serve himself very much <lb/>
of that which is writ to the simple people. And to <lb/>
say the truth, the plainer and more common any notion <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
is, of the greater weight and moment we shall <lb/>
find it, and the more every man is concerned in it. <lb/>
Let me <normalised orig="intreat" auto="true">entreat</normalised> you then not to despise this little Paper, <lb/>
but to read it deliberately, and ponder every sentence <lb/>
in it: For it being so brief (that the memory <lb/>
may not be burdened) there is not a word superfluous, <lb/>
which is not necessary to the unfolding the sense of <lb/>
the command Search the Scriptures also whereby <lb/>
every thing is proved, and <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterwards</normalised> search and examine <lb/>
your selves about the breach of any of these <lb/>
Precepts, either in whole or in part. And if the <lb/>
Judgments of God that lie now so heavy upon us, <lb/>
have begot any purposes of amendment, do not add <lb/>
this new aggravation of your guilt, to break those <lb/>
fresh Vows whereby you have bound your selves to <lb/>
God. And for the <normalised orig="strengthning" auto="true">strengthening</normalised> of them, Give <lb/>
your selves to Prayer, as the Psalmists phrase is <lb/>
Ps 109.4. Considering also seriously (as an help to <lb/>
that) what it is you ask of God in that form of <lb/>
Prayer which our Lord made, of which I have also <lb/>
added a <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>shor*</sic>
                     <corr>short</corr>
                  </choice> Explication. And remember <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>, <lb/>
that all the Prayers you make will not profit you, <lb/>
unless they cause you to keep Gods commands better, <lb/>
which is the end likewise of all you believe. Read <lb/>
over that which we call the Apostles Creed, and <lb/>
you will find that every branch of it <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> naturally <lb/>
bring forth an holy life. When you confess God to <lb/>
be the Creator of the World; it plainly implies his <lb/>
<normalised orig="Supream" auto="true">Supreme</normalised> Authority over you, and the obedience you <lb/>
owe him upon that account. When you <normalised orig="acknowledg" auto="true">acknowledge</normalised> <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
Jesus to be his Son and your Lord, it lays a necessary <lb/>
<normalised orig="ingagement" auto="true">engagement</normalised> on you to be governed by those Laws <lb/>
which the Father Almighty <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> sent him to give <lb/>
us. For he died and rose again to confirm and seal <lb/>
them. He ascended to heaven to take upon him <lb/>
the government of the whole World. And he will <lb/>
come again to <normalised orig="Judg" auto="true">Judge</normalised> both the quick and dead according <lb/>
to their works. And therefore what manner of <lb/>
persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and <lb/>
godliness, that you may be found in peace at his appearing? <lb/>
But it is not my business now to expound <lb/>
the Creed; whose words are better understood then <lb/>
it's <normalised orig="designe" auto="true">design</normalised>; which is (I say) to lead us to the obedience <lb/>
of Gods holy will in all things. That is it <lb/>
which I would gladly promote. And I earnestly <lb/>
beseech you that this small labour may have no small <lb/>
effect, but be so <normalised orig="successfull" auto="true">successful</normalised> as to excite in you such a <lb/>
working Faith as will save your souls.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
God Almighty take you into his protection, and <lb/>
revoke the Orders he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> given to the destroying <lb/>
Angel; that you may not die, but live, to declare <lb/>
the works of the Lord, and to pay your Vows to the <lb/>
most High. Amen. <lb/>
