TO THE <lb/>
MOST REVEREND <lb/>
Father in GOD <lb/>
RICHARD <lb/>
By the Divine Providence <lb/>
Lord ARCHBISHOP <lb/>
OF <lb/>
YORK, <lb/>
Primate of ENGLAND and <lb/>
METROPOLITAN.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
May it please your Grace, <lb/>
I Have often with much pleasure <lb/>
and admiration, observed how <lb/>
rarely every part of Divine Service <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 3</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
is suited to its proper Subject: <lb/>
whereof there needs no better instance <lb/>
than that which is under our <lb/>
present Consideration: The Communion <lb/>
is the most sublime Duty of <lb/>
Christianity, the Compendium of <lb/>
Religion, the best opportunity for <lb/>
Repentance, the highest exercise of <lb/>
Faith, and the strongest engagement <lb/>
to our Charity; and accordingly it <lb/>
is fitted with an Office agreeable to <lb/>
its usefulness and grandeur, wherein <lb/>
the Directions are full and perspicuous, <lb/>
the Exhortations vigorous <lb/>
and importunate, the Devotions fervent <lb/>
and expressive of more than <lb/>
ordinary affections; an Office, <lb/>
wherein equal regard is had to the <lb/>
Majesty of the Ordinance, and the <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
advantage of the Receivers, to the <lb/>
Custom of the <normalised orig="Antient" auto="true">Ancient</normalised> and the benefit <lb/>
of the present times: So that <lb/>
the illustration of this one Part of <lb/>
Liturgy, will contain Arguments <lb/>
to convince the Negligent, Instructions <lb/>
to teach the Ignorant, and be the <lb/>
properest method to prepare us for <lb/>
this Sacrament, to assist us in Receiving, <lb/>
and to confirm us in all Holiness <lb/>
and <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised> afterwards: yea <lb/>
I dare affirm, that he who will conscientiously <lb/>
practise by these measures, <lb/>
can neither be an Ill Man, an <lb/>
Unworthy Receiver, or an Enemy <lb/>
to that Church which affords him <lb/>
such excellent means of Salvation. <lb/>
Wherefore that these endeavours <lb/>
may be made <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> with more Advantage, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 4</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
I have been bold to recommend <lb/>
them to your Graces Patronage, <lb/>
and that with great reason. <lb/>
For their subject being of the highest <lb/>
Mystery, and their design to adorn <lb/>
the most eminent Office of the Church, <lb/>
could no where be more justly presented <lb/>
than to your Grace, who beside <lb/>
the Dignity of your Primacy, and <lb/>
the honour of so High a Station in <lb/>
this Church, are so known a Lover <lb/>
and Patron of all its Primitive Administrations: <lb/>
Besides, your Grace <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a peculiar title to the Author, <lb/>
as well as a Right in the subject of <lb/>
this Discourse; for he first received <lb/>
the Holy Order of Priesthood, and <lb/>
the Power of Dispensing this Sacrament <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
from your Graces <lb/>
Hands, to whom <lb/>
therefore he will ever <lb/>
pay the Reverence <lb/>
and Observance due to <lb/>
a Spiritual Father. <lb/>
In fine, I am obliged <lb/>
to make this Tender, <lb/>
by my Condition and my Duty, by <lb/>
Gratitude and Affection: And your <lb/>
Graces fair Approbation of my first <lb/>
Essay, <normalised orig="encourageth" auto="true">encourages</normalised> this to hope for <lb/>
a Candid acceptance, both as it is <lb/>
a Testimony of my Respect, and as <lb/>
it may minister to the Devotion of <lb/>
those who approach to Gods Altar. <lb/>
My Lord, <lb/>
There is nothing more useful to <lb/>
the friends of this Church, nor more <lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
convincing to the dissenters from it, <lb/>
than to present her pure and Primitive <lb/>
Order of Worship in its natural <lb/>
and lovely <normalised orig="splendor" auto="true">splendour</normalised>, whereof by <lb/>
the Divine mercy, I have seen some <lb/>
Experiments from my former attempt, <lb/>
and if this may prevail also <lb/>
to undeceive the seduced, to amend <lb/>
the <normalised orig="prophane" auto="true">profane</normalised>, and to elevate the devotion <lb/>
of Pious Men, I shall have <lb/>
all I aimed at in this Work, only I <lb/>
most gladly comply with this Opportunity <lb/>
to <normalised orig="testifie" auto="true">testify</normalised> my self <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Your Graces <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Most dutiful Son <lb/>
and most humble Servant, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Tho. <normalised orig="Comber" auto="true">Cumber</normalised>.<lb/>
