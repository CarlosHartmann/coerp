                  <lb/>
To the Reader.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
THe exuberant spawns of illiterate <lb/>
Books proceeding <lb/>
from the polluted wombs <lb/>
of the overloaded, and bejaded <lb/>
adulterate presses, which are all <lb/>
painted with fair titles, I can compare <lb/>
to nothing so fitly as a cheating Lottery; <lb/>
which when the greedy invader <lb/>
comes with hopes for a little money <lb/>
laid down, to carry away a great deal <lb/>
of wit with him, <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> nineteen at least <lb/>
to one when he opens it, but he finds <lb/>
to his shame, that he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> drawn a <lb/>
blank, perhaps a blasphemy; and <lb/>
yet couched under the title of glorious <lb/>
truth, heavenly discoveries, beams <lb/>
of light, new Jerusalem, Gods <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>  <lb/>
clearly revealed, with multitudes of <lb/>
such paints upon their strumpets faces. <lb/>
The sacred Bible which indeed is <lb/>
an <normalised orig="Alablaster-box" auto="false">Alabaster-box</normalised> full of sweet perfumes <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
and precious ointments, is made <lb/>
(alas!) like Pandora's <normalised orig="boxe" auto="true">box</normalised> (in the <lb/>
humane story) which (Epimetheus <lb/>
presumptuously opening) filled the <lb/>
world with evils, diseases and calamities <lb/>
of all <normalised orig="kindes" auto="true">kinds</normalised>. The sacred Bible is <lb/>
made now the patron of <normalised orig="Prophane" auto="true">Profane</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> practises; never were <normalised orig="grosse" auto="true">gross</normalised> sins <lb/>
at such an impudent height as now <lb/>
they are; what horrid impudence is <lb/>
that of <normalised orig="hel" auto="true">hell</normalised> to take heaven by the hand? <lb/>
Sins that were wont to hide themselves <lb/>
in the holes and clefts of obscurity, <lb/>
not daring to behold the light, but <lb/>
Serpent-like, to creep under the low <lb/>
shrubs of <normalised orig="deceitfull" auto="true">deceitful</normalised> shifts, how do they <lb/>
Eagle-like sit <normalised orig="pearching" auto="true">perching</normalised> on the goodly <lb/>
Cedars (I mean Pulpits and Thrones) <lb/>
the Cedars of God, and dare to cast <lb/>
up their eyes towards the Sun? who <lb/>
would think it! yet what this day <lb/>
more common then to meet the <normalised orig="devill" auto="true">devil</normalised> <lb/>
with his eyes towards heaven, and a <lb/>
Bible under his <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised>, <normalised orig="cloathing" auto="true">clothing</normalised> all his <lb/>
words and actions cap a pea in Scripture <lb/>
phrases; Murderers, traitors, rebels, <lb/>
blasphemers, soothsayers, adulterers, <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
sabbath-breakers, perjurers, <normalised orig="oppressours" auto="true">oppressors</normalised>, <lb/>
and almost all notorious villains <lb/>
have marshalled themselves (like <lb/>
the Roman Clergy) into so many <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> <lb/>
Sects of religion, all impudently <lb/>
assuming to themselves the usurped <lb/>
title of eminent Saints, and quoting <lb/>
Scripture for their actions, and scotfree <lb/>
<normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> the <normalised orig="presse" auto="true">press</normalised> into the world to <lb/>
make more proselytes: so that he that <lb/>
in his Soul-frozen age shall go to gather <lb/>
Books to warm his Soul, (as Paul <lb/>
did sticks to warm his fingers) will be <lb/>
sure, if he be not wary, to gather vipers <lb/>
into his <normalised orig="bosome" auto="true">bosom</normalised>: And how am I stung <lb/>
with pain and <normalised orig="horrour" auto="true">horror</normalised>, whiles I meditate <lb/>
on the thousands of poor souls <lb/>
that are gnawed to death by these <lb/>
speckled vipers! Sure it cannot but sit <lb/>
sad one day upon the spirits of those <lb/>
licentious Licencers, that are as the <lb/>
midwives of such monsters. <lb/>
For thy comfort therefore and <normalised orig="incouragement" auto="true">encouragement</normalised> <lb/>
(Reader) I do assure thee <lb/>
this Book is free from all such venomous <lb/>
beasts, no toad of malice, nor <lb/>
serpent of deceit lurks either in the <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 3</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
matter or the phrase hereof. In plain <lb/>
English, it is a pleasant, heavenly, self-searching, <lb/>
soul-convincing, sin-condemning, <lb/>
heart-humbling, spirit-raising, <lb/>
<normalised orig="grace-quickning" auto="false">grace-quickening</normalised>, Christ-exalting <lb/>
book. I need say no more, they are the <lb/>
Sermons of Mr. Christopher Love, <lb/>
Master of Arts, and Minister of the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Gospell" auto="true">Gospel</normalised> of Christ, whose actions, life <lb/>
and death, will eternize his name; I <lb/>
may truly say of his elegant style, and <lb/>
pleasant way of expressing himself, as <lb/>
he of Gregory Nazianzen, <lb/>
                  Viribus eloquit valuit, <choice ana="print">
                        <sic>linguaq;</sic>
                        <corr>linguaque</corr>
                     </choice> diserta: <lb/>
Mellifluos dulci protulit ore sonos.
                  <lb/>
The subject of these Sermons is of <lb/>
<normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> use to all sorts of people, much <lb/>
like in that, to that text of Chrysostomes <lb/>
in <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>.4.2. which (as he saith) if <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <lb/>
had a voice like thunder, and a mighty <lb/>
mountain for his pulpit, and all the <lb/>
men and women in the world for his <lb/>
auditory, he would choose this text to <lb/>
preach on: <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 4.2">O <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> sons of men, how <lb/>
long will <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> turn my glory into shame? <lb/>
how <normalised orig="ling" auto="true">long</normalised> will <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> love vanity, and seek <lb/>
after leasing?</quote> Had this been really effected, <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
and I been there in Mr. Loves <lb/>
spirit, would <normalised orig="Chrysostome" auto="true">Chrisostome</normalised> have lent me <lb/>
his voice, and allowed me the use of his <lb/>
monarchical pulpit, when he had done <lb/>
in the morning with his text, I would <lb/>
have come up in the evening with this <lb/>
text, Eph.2.12 <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.12">That at that time <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> were <lb/>
without Christ, being aliens from the <lb/>
Commonwealth of Israel, and strangers <lb/>
from the Covenant of Promise, having <lb/>
no hope, and without God in the World</quote>: <lb/>
but this need not, for it is in a manner <lb/>
effected already: this worthy Minister <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> ascended that pulpit from <lb/>
whence <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="thundred" auto="true">thundered</normalised> into the <lb/>
world, he is now one of those blessed <lb/>
ones, <normalised orig="tht" auto="true">that</normalised> <normalised orig="dyed" auto="true">died</normalised> in and for the Lord, <lb/>
he is at rest from all his labours, and <lb/>
now behold his works do follow him; <lb/>
some are already gone before, and <lb/>
these do follow after. These Sermons <lb/>
were preached at St. Anne's Aldersgate, <lb/>
where this holy young man was <lb/>
Pastor: I pray God they may prove <lb/>
as the great trumpet of God, to cause <lb/>
a <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> resurrection amongst those <lb/>
people before they go down to the <lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
house of <normalised orig="rottennesse" auto="true">rottenness</normalised>; it cannot but <lb/>
much <normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised> those people to hear <lb/>
their Pastors voice again, those sheep <lb/>
cannot but know their shepherds <lb/>
voice; which that they may <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>, the <lb/>
Lord of heaven <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> these his worthy <lb/>
labours to their, and thy <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> <lb/>
advantage; so as that the distressed <lb/>
Churches <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised> in his sad and unexpected <lb/>
absence, may be made up in <lb/>
the blessing of God, upon these and the <lb/>
rest of his pious and <normalised orig="painfull" auto="true">painful</normalised> labours. <lb/>
So <normalised orig="prayeth" auto="true">prays</normalised>, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Thine,<lb/>
