PREFACE <lb/>
To the AUTHOR of <lb/>
CHARITY MAINTAINED: <lb/>
WITH <lb/>
An Answer to his Pamphlet, <normalised orig="entituled" auto="true">entitled</normalised> A Direction to N. N.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
SIR,<lb/>
UPon the first news of the publication of your Book, I <lb/>
used all diligence, with speed to procure it; and came <lb/>
with such a mind to the reading of it, as S. Austin, before <lb/>
he was a <normalised orig="setled" auto="true">settled</normalised> <normalised orig="Catholique" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>, brought to his conference <lb/>
with Faustus the Manichee. For, as he thought <lb/>
that if any thing more than ordinary might be said in <lb/>
defence of the Manichean Doctrine, Faustus was the <lb/>
man from whom it was to be expected: So many <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised> concerning you <lb/>
was, Si Pergama dextra Defendi possunt, certe hac defensa videbo. For I <lb/>
conceived that among the Champions of the Roman Church, the English <lb/>
in reason must be the best, or <normalised orig="equall" auto="true">equal</normalised> to the best, as being the most expert <lb/>
Masters trained up purposely for this war, and perpetually practised in it. <lb/>
Among the English, I saw the <normalised orig="Jesuites" auto="true">Jesuits</normalised> would yield the first place to none; <lb/>
and men so wise in their generation as the Jesuits were, if they had any Achilles <lb/>
among them, I presumed, would make choice of him for this service. <lb/>
And besides, I had good assurance, that in the framing of this building, <lb/>
though you were the only Architect, yet you wanted not the assistance of <lb/>
many diligent hands to bring you in <normalised orig="choise" auto="true">choice</normalised> materials towards it; nor of <lb/>
many careful and watchful eyes, to correct the errors of your Work, if any <lb/>
should chance to escape you. Great reason therefore had I to expect great <lb/>
matters from you, and that your Book should have in it the Spirit and Elixir <lb/>
of all that can be said in defence of your Church and Doctrine; and to <lb/>
assure my self, that if my resolution not to believe it, were not built upon <lb/>
the rock of evident grounds and reasons, but only upon some sandy and <lb/>
deceitful appearances, now the wind and storm and floods were coming, <lb/>
which would undoubtedly overthrow it. <lb/>
2. Neither truly were you more willing to effect such an alteration <lb/>
in me, then I was to have it effected. For my desire is to go the right way <lb/>
to eternal happiness. But whether this way lie on the right hand or the <lb/>
left, or straight forwards; whether it be by following a living Guide, or <lb/>
by seeking my direction in a Book, or by <normalised orig="hearkning" auto="true">harkening</normalised> to the secret whisper <lb/>
of some private Spirit, to me it is indifferent. And he that is otherwise affected, <lb/>
and <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not a travellers indifference, which Epictetus requires in all <lb/>
that would find the truth, but much desires in respect of his ease, or pleasure, <lb/>
or profit, or advancement, or satisfaction of friends, or any humane <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">B</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
consideration, that one way should be true rather than another; it is odds <lb/>
but he will take his desire that it should be so, for an assurance that it is so. <lb/>
But, I for my part, unless I deceive my self, was, and still am so affected, as I <lb/>
have made profession, not willing I confess to take any thing upon trust, and <lb/>
to believe it without asking my self why; no, nor able to command my self <lb/>
(were I never so willing) to follow, like a sheep, every Shepherd that <lb/>
should take upon him to guide me; or every flock that should chance to go <lb/>
before me: but most apt and most willing to be led by reason to any way, <lb/>
or from it; and <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> submitting all other reasons to this one; God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
said so, therefore it is true. Nor yet was I so unreasonable as to expect Mathematical <lb/>
demonstrations from you in matters plainly incapable of them, <lb/>
such as are to be believed, and, if we speak properly, <normalised orig="cannto" auto="false">cannot</normalised> be known; <lb/>
such therefore I expected not. For, as he is an unreasonable Master, who requires <lb/>
a stronger assent to his conclusions then his arguments deserve; so I <lb/>
conceive him a <normalised orig="froward" auto="true">foreward</normalised> and <normalised orig="undisciplin'd" auto="true">undisciplined</normalised> Scholar, who desires stronger <lb/>
arguments for a conclusion than the Matter will bear. But, had you represented <lb/>
to my understanding such reasons of your Doctrine, as, being weighed <lb/>
in an <normalised orig="eaven" auto="true">even</normalised> <normalised orig="ballance" auto="true">balance</normalised>, held by an <normalised orig="eaven" auto="true">even</normalised> hand, with those on the other <lb/>
side, would have turned the scale, and have made your Religion more <lb/>
credible than the contrary; certainly, I should have despised the shame of <lb/>
one more alteration, and with both mine arms and all my heart most readily <lb/>
have embraced it. Such was my expectation from you, and such my <lb/>
preparation, which I brought with me to the reading of your Book. <lb/>
3. Would you know now what the event was, what effect was wrought <lb/>
in me, by the perusal and consideration of it? To deal truly and ingenuously <lb/>
with you, I fell somewhat in my good opinion both of your sufficiency <lb/>
and sincerity: but was exceedingly confirmed in my ill opinion of the <lb/>
Cause maintained by you. I found every where snares that might entrap, <lb/>
and colours that might deceive the simple; but nothing that might <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised>, <lb/>
and very little that might move an understanding man, and one that <lb/>
can discern between Discourse and Sophistry. In short, I was verily <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> <lb/>
that I plainly saw and could make it appear, to all dis-passionate <lb/>
and unprejudicate Judges, that a vein of sophistry and calumny did run <lb/>
clean <normalised orig="thorow" auto="true">through</normalised> it from the beginning to the end. And letting some Friends <lb/>
understand so much, I suffered my self to be <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> by them, that it <lb/>
would not be either unproper for me, nor unacceptable to God, nor peradventure <lb/>
altogether unservicable to his Church, nor justly offensive to you <lb/>
(if you indeed were a lover of Truth, and not a maintainer of a Faction,) if <lb/>
setting aside the Second Part, which was in a manner wholly employed in <lb/>
particular disputes, repetitions and references, and in wranglings with D. <lb/>
Potter about the sense of some supernumerary quotations, and whereon the <lb/>
main question no way depends, I would make a fair and ingenuous answer <lb/>
to the First, wherein the substance of the present <normalised orig="Controversie" auto="true">Controversy</normalised> is confessedly <lb/>
contained; and which, if it were clearly answered, no man would desire <lb/>
any other answer to the Second. This therefore I undertook with a full <lb/>
resolution to be an adversary to your Errors, but a Friend and Servant to <lb/>
your Person: and so much the more a friend to your person, by how much <lb/>
the severer and more rigid adversary I was to your errors. <lb/>
4. In this Work my conscience bears me witness that I have, according to <lb/>
your advice, proceeded always with this consideration, that I am to give a <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
most strict account of every line, and word, that <normalised orig="passeth" auto="true">passes</normalised> under my pen: and <lb/>
therefore have been precisely careful for the matter of my Book to defend <lb/>
truth only, and only by Truth. And then, scrupulously fearful of scandalizing <lb/>
you or any man with the manner of handling it. From this Rule, sure <lb/>
I am, I have not willingly swerved in either part of it; and, that I might not <lb/>
do it ignorantly, I have not only my self examined mine own Work, (perhaps <lb/>
with more severity than I have done yours, as conceiving it a base <lb/>
and unchristian thing to go about to <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised> others with what I my self am <lb/>
not fully satisfied;) but have also made it pass the fiery <normalised orig="tryal" auto="true">trial</normalised> of the exact <lb/>
censures of many understanding Judges, <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> heartily wishing that you <lb/>
your Self had been of the Quorum. But they who did undergo this <normalised orig="burthen" auto="true">burden</normalised>, <lb/>
as they wanted not sufficiency to discover heterodox Doctrine, so I am <lb/>
sure, they have been very careful to let nothing slip dissonant from truth or <lb/>
from the authorized Doctrine of the Church of England: and therefore <lb/>
whatsoever causeless or groundless <normalised orig="jealousie" auto="true">jealousy</normalised>, any man may entertain concerning <lb/>
my Person, yet my Book, I presume, in reason and common equity <lb/>
should be free from them; wherein I hope, that little or nothing <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> escaped <lb/>
so many eyes, which being weighed in the balance of the Sanctuary, <lb/>
will be found too light. And in this hope I am much confirmed, by <lb/>
your strange carriage of your self in this whole business. For though by <lb/>
some crooked and sinister arts, you have got my Answer into your hands, <lb/>
now a year since and upwards, as I have been assured by some that profess <lb/>
to know it, and those of your own party; though you could not want <lb/>
every day fair opportunities of sending to me, and acquainting me with <lb/>
any Exceptions, which, you conceived, might be justly taken to it, or any <lb/>
part of it (than which nothing could have been more welcome to me) yet <lb/>
hitherto you have not been pleased to acquaint me with any one. Nay <lb/>
more, though you have been at sundry times, and by several <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised>, entreated <lb/>
and <normalised orig="sollicited" auto="true">solicited</normalised>, nay pressed and importuned by me, to <normalised orig="joyn" auto="true">join</normalised> with me <lb/>
in a private discussion of the <normalised orig="Controversie" auto="true">Controversy</normalised> between us, before the publication <lb/>
of my Answer, (because I was extremely unwilling to publish any <lb/>
thing which had not passed all manners of <normalised orig="tryals" auto="true">trials</normalised>, as desiring not that I, or <lb/>
my Side, but that Truth might overcome on which Side <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised> it was;) <lb/>
though I have protested to you, and sent it under my hand, (which protestation <lb/>
by Gods help I would have made good) If you, or any other <lb/>
would undertake your Cause, would give me fair meeting, and choose <lb/>
out of your whole Book any argument, whereof you were most confident, <lb/>
and by which you would be content the rest should be judged of, <lb/>
and make it appear that I had not, or could not answer it, that I would <lb/>
desist from the work which I had undertaken, and answer none at all; <lb/>
though by all the Arts which possibly I could devise, I have provoked you <lb/>
to such a trial, in particular by assuring you that if you refused it, the World <lb/>
should be informed of your tergiversation: notwithstanding all this, you <lb/>
have perpetually, and obstinately declined it; which to my understanding <lb/>
is a very evident sign that there is not any truth in your Cause, nor <lb/>
(which is impossible there should be) strength in your Arguments, especially <lb/>
considering what our Saviour <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> told us, <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 3.20-21">Every one that <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> <normalised orig="hateth" auto="true">hates</normalised> the light, neither <normalised orig="cometh" auto="true">comes</normalised> to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved; <lb/>
but he that <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> truth, <normalised orig="cometh" auto="true">comes</normalised> to the light that his deeds may be <lb/>
made manifest that they are wrought in God.</quote>
