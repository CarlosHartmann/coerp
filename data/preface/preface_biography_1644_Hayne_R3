Christian Reader:<lb/>
                  <lb/>
DAvid a man after Gods <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised><lb/>
heart, as in other respects so especially<lb/>
in not forgetting any<lb/>
of Gods benefits, but frequently<lb/>
and sweetly descanting<lb/>
on them in his sacred songs of praise, among<lb/>
many other blessings, mentions Gods gracious<lb/>
leading his people out of Egypt, &amp; teaching<lb/>
them by the <normalised orig="ministery" auto="true">ministry</normalised> of Moses and<lb/>
Aaron. The like <normalised orig="thankfulnesse" auto="true">thankfulness</normalised> to God should<lb/>
we <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> in our hymns of <normalised orig="glorie" auto="true">glory</normalised> to God,<lb/>
as for infinite other favours in these later<lb/>
times, so especially for our <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> out of the<lb/>
<normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> Egypt, by the <normalised orig="Ministery" auto="true">Ministry</normalised> of Dr.<lb/>
Mart. Luther. The <normalised orig="goodnesse" auto="true">goodness</normalised> of God to the<lb/>
Israelites and Us is much alike in both these<lb/>
our deliverances. For when <normalised orig="Egypts" auto="true">Egypt</normalised> <normalised orig="tyrannie" auto="true">tyranny</normalised><lb/>
was <normalised orig="growne" auto="true">grown</normalised> to extremity, and <normalised orig="Romes" auto="true">Rooms</normalised> heresies<lb/>
at full maturity, God seasonably put to<lb/>
                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>
his hand, and by Moses, then bred up in Pharaohs<lb/>
Court, and by D. Luther, lately trained<lb/>
up in Monkery, <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> a like mercy to us<lb/>
both. However men did project to <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>b*nd</sic>
                     <corr>bend</corr>
                  </choice> the<lb/>
excellent endowments of these worthy men to<lb/>
their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> purposes, God turned them to better<lb/>
use, and seasoning them with his grace, fitted<lb/>
them for the confusion of the Old &amp; New<lb/>
<normalised orig="Egypts" auto="true">Egypt</normalised>. God will be plainly <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised> to<lb/>
have matters of great importance at his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised><lb/>
disposing. He of his great <normalised orig="goodnesse" auto="true">goodness</normalised> directs to<lb/>
the right object his servants ardent <normalised orig="zeale" auto="true">zeal</normalised> to<lb/>
do good: as in judgement he lets the malicious<lb/>
and envious <normalised orig="zeale" auto="true">zeal</normalised> of <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic><normalised orig="bo" auto="true">by</normalised>*h</sic>
                     <corr>both</corr>
                  </choice> <normalised orig="Egypts" auto="true">Egypt</normalised> persist in an<lb/>
<normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> course to their overthrow. Hence it was,<lb/>
that as God took off S. Paul from his <normalised orig="blinde" auto="true">blind</normalised><lb/>
and unseasonable <normalised orig="zeale" auto="true">zeal</normalised> for Moses Law in the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Pharisaicall" auto="true">Pharizeeical</normalised> way, and bent it to the advancing<lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Gospell" auto="true">Gospel</normalised>: So he quelled <normalised orig="Luthers" auto="true">Luther's</normalised><lb/>
raging fury and intent to vex and kill the opposers<lb/>
of the Pope: &amp; put a zealous spirit into<lb/>
him for the maintenance of sacred Truth, and<lb/>
the downfall of Popish superstition. And indeed<lb/>
rightly did Erasmus judge, that those<lb/>
corrupt times called for a sharpe, and<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="launcing" auto="false">lancing</normalised> and fearing <normalised orig="Chirurgion" auto="true">Surgeon</normalised>, to cure<lb/>
their long festered maladies. For the worship<lb/>
of God and the truth of Religion was then (as<lb/>
amongst the Israelites in Elias time) much<lb/>
depraved and defaced, and required a magnanimous<lb/>
and undaunted spirit, like to that in Elias,<lb/>
to <normalised orig="reforme" auto="true">reform</normalised> matters <normalised orig="extreamly" auto="true">extremely</normalised> out of frame.<lb/>
Erasmus saw full well, how difficult a <normalised orig="taske" auto="true">task</normalised><lb/>
D. Luther underwent, and for his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> part<lb/>
and undertaking was assured, that if the<lb/>
knowledge of good Arts, of polite Learning,<lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Originall" auto="true">Original</normalised> tongues, of the Sacred<lb/>
Scripture <normalised orig="florisht" auto="false">flourished</normalised>, that the dark fogs of<lb/>
Popery could not long continue <normalised orig="undispel'd" auto="false">undispelled</normalised>.<lb/>
And therefore he <normalised orig="complyed" auto="true">complied</normalised> with all Princes,<lb/>
and men studious of good letters whatsoever,<lb/>
to make a knowing world: and would<lb/>
in no wise, though earnestly set upon both by<lb/>
loving <normalised orig="intreaties" auto="true">entreaties</normalised> and <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> usage, as also by<lb/>
bitter calumnies, and harsh railings of the<lb/>
Pontificans, <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> any thing of <normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised> moment<lb/>
against Luther. He was confident, that, if<lb/>
Luther, being violently opposed and maliced,<lb/>
should <normalised orig="faile" auto="true">fail</normalised>, yet the Truth of Christ, by the<lb/>
light of all good literature and Gods blessing,<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">b2</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
would, <normalised orig="maugre" auto="true">meagre</normalised> all the Papists malice, get the<lb/>
upper hand, and spread it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>.<lb/>
But God was abundantly gracious to D.<lb/>
Luther, and made him, as <normalised orig="Ieremy" auto="true">Jeremy</normalised>, a defenced<lb/>
<normalised orig="citie" auto="true">city</normalised>, an iron pillar, and a wall of<lb/>
<normalised orig="brasse" auto="true">brass</normalised>, against which his Antagonists could<lb/>
in no wise <normalised orig="prevaile" auto="true">prevail</normalised>. Had a spirit of pride or<lb/>
contention, or any by-respect set Luther<lb/>
on work against the Pope, or had he stood upon<lb/>
questions litigious, or of an indifferent nature,<lb/>
he could never have begun with that courage,<lb/>
gone forward with that confidence, come<lb/>
off with that honour, which he did. The blessing<lb/>
of God and a good conscience bore<lb/>
him out, to take such incredible <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> in reading,<lb/>
preaching, translating, commenting, disputing,<lb/>
writing, advising the <normalised orig="Politicall" auto="true">Political</normalised><lb/>
State, directing the <normalised orig="Ecclesiasticall" auto="true">Ecclesiastical</normalised>, restraining<lb/>
the Papists fury from open war, counselling<lb/>
some Protestants from too <normalised orig="hastie" auto="true">hasty</normalised> proceedings,<lb/>
preventing tumultuous <normalised orig="designes" auto="true">designs</normalised>, avoiding<lb/>
secret traps set for him, and in daily praying<lb/>
to God for the prosperity of the <normalised orig="Gospell" auto="true">Gospel</normalised>.<lb/>
All true Christians will heartily <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised><lb/>
God for him, and his resolute and happy beginning<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
of Reformation: if Papists who notoriously<lb/>
defamed and slandered him in his life<lb/>
time, persist still to calumniate him after his<lb/>
death, God in the last day will be judge <normalised orig="betweene" auto="true">between</normalised><lb/>
them. Luther was (and who is not?)<lb/>
subject to such weaknesses, as humanity makes<lb/>
incident to the best men. He knew his slips, he<lb/>
acknowledged them, he craved pardon for<lb/>
them. Yea, he considering, that he was a man,<lb/>
and might <normalised orig="erre" auto="true">err</normalised>, <normalised orig="intrusted" auto="true">entrusted</normalised> his learned and<lb/>
<normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> friend Melancthon to revise and<lb/>
moderate some of his <normalised orig="Tenents" auto="true">Tenants</normalised> after his decease.<lb/>
In <normalised orig="briefe" auto="true">brief</normalised> <normalised orig="Luthers" auto="true">Luther's</normalised> faith was admirably<lb/>
strong in his God, his labours and studies of<lb/>
singular benefit to Gods Church, his books<lb/>
and writings very many and learned, his life<lb/>
most pious, and therefore his death full of<lb/>
comfort and blessed.<lb/>
Accept (good Reader) this Treatise now<lb/>
presented unto you in an English <normalised orig="dresse" auto="true">dress</normalised>, out<lb/>
of the learned and laborious work of Melchior<lb/>

before, others, but sparingly in English set<lb/>
forth; all of them worthy of everlasting memory<lb/>
for their promoting of Gods glory, and<lb/>
their love to Christian Truth. These will<lb/>
shortly <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> from the Pens of sundry reverend,<lb/>
