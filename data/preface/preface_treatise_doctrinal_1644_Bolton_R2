TO MY <lb/>
BELOVED <lb/>
FRIENDS, <lb/>
The Godly and Well-affected <lb/>
of Saviours-Southwark; <lb/>
Grace and Peace.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Beloved, <lb/>
IT is now well-nigh four <lb/>
<normalised orig="yeeres" auto="false">years</normalised> since I was removed <lb/>
from a loving, a <lb/>
very loving people in <lb/>
the City, and fixed among you; the <lb/>
expresses of love which in this time <lb/>
I have received from you, have put <lb/>
me on to think, what way I might <lb/>
again manifest my <normalised orig="ingagements" auto="false">engagements</normalised> to <lb/>
you: And considering with my self <lb/>
the relation wherein I stand, I could <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 3</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
think of no better way of acknowledgement <lb/>
then to impart something <lb/>
<normalised orig="spirituall" auto="false">spiritual</normalised> to you; and no better subject <lb/>
then this which is now presented <lb/>
to your view, nor could I think of a <lb/>
better time then this for the doing of <lb/>
it, when God in our blood <normalised orig="shewes" auto="true">shows</normalised> us <lb/>
what a <normalised orig="fearfull" auto="true">fearful</normalised> thing it is to be guilty <lb/>
of the blood of his <normalised orig="Sonne" auto="true">Son</normalised>; It is not <lb/>
unknown unto you, how greatly this <lb/>
place above many others, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been <lb/>
guilty of the <normalised orig="prophanation" auto="true">profanation</normalised> of this Ordinance <lb/>
of the Lords Supper; God <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> discovered it to us, humbled us <lb/>
for it, <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> us the necessity, and <lb/>
graciously inclined your spirits to the <lb/>
desire of the reformation of it. In reference <lb/>
to which (through the countenance <lb/>
and assistance of you) my brother <lb/>
Minister and my self, have adventured <lb/>
to set upon the work, being <lb/>
willing to put our selves to no <lb/>
little trouble, if by that wee might <lb/>
prevent a great deal of sin. In this <lb/>
work (the searcher of hearts <normalised orig="knowes" auto="true">knows</normalised>) <lb/>
we have had no other design, then to <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
express our <normalised orig="Pastorall" auto="true">Pastoral</normalised> duties, and declare <lb/>
our <normalised orig="Pastorall" auto="true">Pastoral</normalised> affections towards <lb/>
your souls: In short, to serve you in <lb/>
love: Probably we may meet with many <lb/>
obstacles in the carrying on this <lb/>
work; Indeed, it is that which is <lb/>
expected; nay, and that which wee <lb/>
reckoned on before we <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> on it. <lb/>
But if the work be God's, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> will <lb/>
either facilitate and make it <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> for <lb/>
us, or give us spirits proportionable <lb/>
to the greatness of it, I say <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> will <lb/>
either lessen the difficulties, or heighten <lb/>
our spirits to conflict and <normalised orig="incounter" auto="true">encounter</normalised> <lb/>
with them. <lb/>
There are two sort of adversaries <lb/>
which we expect to meet <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>: some <lb/>
that will say, we go too far, and others <lb/>
who will blame us that we go no further. <lb/>
To them that think we have gone <lb/>
too far, I shall only say, that we hope <lb/>
we have not gone beyond God's bounds; <lb/>
sure as God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a purpose this <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>Ordidinance</sic>
                     <corr>Ordinance</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
should be continued, so <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 4</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a care also, that it should be fenced <lb/>
from <normalised orig="prophanation" auto="true">profanation</normalised> in the continuance <lb/>
of it; and when a better way <lb/>
shall be discovered to us, wherein we <lb/>
may hold up the use of this Ordinance, <lb/>
and yet fence it (in the use of <lb/>
it) from evident <normalised orig="prophanation" auto="true">profanation</normalised>, wee <lb/>
are ready to listen to it, and be <normalised orig="thankfull" auto="true">thankful</normalised> <lb/>
for it; in the mean, wee do not <lb/>
see it our duty to hold up the use of <lb/>
this Ordinance, except there be some <lb/>
fence set up (all former fences being <lb/>
insufficient, and now broken down) <lb/>
to keep this Ordinance from manifest <lb/>
<normalised orig="prophanation" auto="true">profanation</normalised>, unless you will say <lb/>
our <normalised orig="Pastorall" auto="true">Pastoral</normalised> office <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised>, in the exercise <lb/>
of it, necessitate us to sin. Much <lb/>
more might be said, if wee saw it either <lb/>
requisite or convenient for an <lb/>
Epistle. <lb/>
To those who blame us we go no further, <lb/>
I must say our design <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="bin" auto="true">been</normalised> rather <lb/>
to tempt on, by going their pace, <lb/>
then to discourage by over-driving <lb/>
our little ones, I say it <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been our <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
aim to cherish, not to quench, to draw <lb/>
out, not to suppress the graces of our <lb/>
people; and therefore have we desired <lb/>
to improve those graces which wee <lb/>
found, though weak, rather then to <lb/>
expect that which was not to be <lb/>
found. Our present reformation, it <lb/>
is not the measure of our will, but of <lb/>
our power; it is not the utmost wee <lb/>
desire, but the utmost wee are able: <lb/>
And though it may seem small to you, <lb/>
yet despise not the day of small things; <lb/>
though the house is not built, yet wee <lb/>
<normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised> the first stone is laid, and wee <lb/>
could not choose but bring it forth <lb/>
with shouting, Grace, Grace, unto it, <lb/>
and Glory, Glory to the Lord. Babylon <lb/>
was not built in a day, neither <lb/>
is <normalised orig="Sion" auto="true">Zion</normalised>; God carries on his works <lb/>
without us, as he <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> his works within <lb/>
us, by degrees; the greatest fire <lb/>
was at first a spark, the tallest Oak <lb/>
at the first an Achorne, the strongest <lb/>
Christian had his <normalised orig="infancie" auto="true">infancy</normalised>, and the <lb/>
greatest work of God its mean beginnings; <lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
Would the corruption of former <lb/>
times have suffered our godly <lb/>
<normalised orig="predecessours" auto="true">predecessors</normalised>, to have left the work <lb/>
in that forwardness to us, in which <lb/>
through God's blessing, it may be left <lb/>
to them who shall succeed, possibly, <lb/>
nay probably, the work might have <lb/>
been <normalised orig="carryed" auto="true">carried</normalised> on to a greater height <lb/>
then now it can; That which is done <lb/>
wee desire to bless God for it, and <lb/>
think it our duty to cherish with our <lb/>
utmost prayers and <normalised orig="indeavours" auto="true">endeavours</normalised>; In <lb/>
relation to which, these ensuing Sermons <lb/>
formerly preached, are now <lb/>
printed, to which work, if they shall <lb/>
be any thing serviceable, they have <lb/>
obtained the end of him, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Who is not unwilling to <lb/>
spend, and be spent <lb/>
for you: <lb/>
S. BOLTON.<lb/>
