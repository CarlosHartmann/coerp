                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
To the Reader. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
THou which <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> a tender Conscience, and <normalised orig="desirest" auto="true">desire</normalised> <lb/>
nothing so much as to know the right <lb/>
way to Heaven, having many doubts which <lb/>
cause thee to leave thy own Pastor, and <normalised orig="runne" auto="true">run</normalised> <lb/>
not only to other <normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> Congregations, but also to the <lb/>
private meetings of the Separatists and others for resolution. <lb/>
For thy sake and safety I have published this Treatise, <lb/>
in which thou <normalised orig="maist" auto="true">may</normalised> <normalised orig="discerne" auto="true">discern</normalised> truth from error, having <lb/>
their errors set before thee, with the confutation of them <lb/>
out of the holy Scripture. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
OUr Lord and Saviour in his holy Sermon in the <lb/>
Mount, telling his Disciples of the narrow way that <lb/>
<normalised orig="leadeth" auto="true">leads</normalised> unto life: He specially <normalised orig="fore-warneth" auto="false">forewarned</normalised> them of <lb/>
false Prophets: <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 7.15">Beware of false Prophets which come to <lb/>
you in sheeps <normalised orig="cloathing" auto="true">clothing</normalised>, but inwardly they are ravening <lb/>
Wolves</quote>: As if he should say, my <normalised orig="deare" auto="true">dear</normalised> Disciples, you <lb/>
hearing of the way to heaven, <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> be enquiring after it, <lb/>
and especially of Prophets. But let me forewarn you of <lb/>
false Prophets: for instead of directing you, they <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> put <lb/>
you out of the way. False prophets will come, they are <lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
not sent: St. Paul <normalised orig="asketh" auto="true">asks</normalised> how they <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr>can</corr>
                  </choice> preach except <lb/>
they be sent? and this <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised> with good reason: every <lb/>
true Minister <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised> in Gods <normalised orig="roome" auto="true">room</normalised> being the Lords <lb/>
<normalised orig="Embassadour" auto="true">Ambassador</normalised> to deliver his will, who dare do this unsent? <lb/>
No man <normalised orig="taketh" auto="true">takes</normalised> this honour to <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, but he that <lb/>
is called of God saith my Author to the Hebrews. <lb/>
But whence come they now, from the <normalised orig="Schooles" auto="true">Schools</normalised> of <lb/>
the Prophets? no, many of them from <normalised orig="mechannicke" auto="false">mechanic</normalised> <lb/>
Trades: as one from a stable from currying his horses: <lb/>
another from his stall from <normalised orig="cobling" auto="true">cobbling</normalised> his <normalised orig="shooes" auto="true">shoes</normalised>, &amp; these <lb/>
sit <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> in Moses <normalised orig="chaire" auto="true">chair</normalised> to mend all, as <normalised orig="Embassadours" auto="true">Ambassadors</normalised> <lb/>
of Jesus Christ, as Heralds of the most high God: these <lb/>
take upon them to <normalised orig="reveale" auto="true">reveal</normalised> the secrets of Almighty <lb/>
God, to open and shut heaven, to save <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised>. <lb/>
But to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> these fellows to discourse of the holy <lb/>
Trinity, of Gods <normalised orig="eternall" auto="true">eternal</normalised> decree and other deep points <lb/>
of Divinity: you may <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> the mad men in Bedlam <lb/>
prate as wisely as they: and are not their hearers that <lb/>
run after them as mad as they? Are they not bewitched? <lb/>
as St. Paul <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> the Gallatians. <lb/>
To you that are my Disciples: daily experience <normalised orig="sheweth" auto="true">shows</normalised> <lb/>
us whom the Anabaptists, Brownists and other Sectaries <lb/>
go about to seduce, viz. not Drunkards, Adulterers, <lb/>
Swearers, and <normalised orig="prophane" auto="true">profane</normalised> persons whom the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> ensnared already, but such as are desirous of <lb/>
heaven. They lead captive (saith St. Paul,) silly women <lb/>
who are <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> learning. They <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 7.15">come unto you in sheeps <lb/>
<normalised orig="cloathing" auto="true">clothing</normalised></quote>: That is, like zealous and holy Christians; <lb/>
For example, the <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> <normalised orig="turneth" auto="true">turns</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> into an <normalised orig="Angell" auto="true">Angel</normalised> <lb/>
of Light: Baals Priests used long prayers: the <lb/>
blasphemous Arrians (as St. Bazill <normalised orig="writeth" auto="true">writes</normalised>) were easily <lb/>
<normalised orig="beleeved" auto="true">believed</normalised> because of their counterfeit <normalised orig="holinesse" auto="true">holiness</normalised>. <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
The <normalised orig="Romish" auto="true">Roman</normalised> seducers pretend great Sanctimony: <lb/>
the begging <normalised orig="Fryers" auto="true">Friars</normalised> <normalised orig="befool'd" auto="true">befooled</normalised> the Christian world with <lb/>
their pretended <normalised orig="holinesse" auto="true">holiness</normalised>, with which they varnished <lb/>
their lewd lives. Generally they come to you with <lb/>
outward sanctimony, with a seeming contempt of the <lb/>
world, with long prayers, fasting <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised>, <normalised orig="almes-deeds" auto="true">alms-deeds</normalised>, <lb/>
seeming <normalised orig="zeale" auto="true">zeal</normalised>, seeming humility, seeming <normalised orig="harmlesnesse" auto="true">harmlessness</normalised>, <lb/>

                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 7.15">They come to you in <normalised orig="sheepes" auto="true">sheep</normalised> <normalised orig="cloathing" auto="true">clothing</normalised></quote>, insinuating <lb/>

                  </choice>: as the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> their <normalised orig="chiefe" auto="true">chief</normalised>, councelling our <lb/>
first Parents to <normalised orig="breake" auto="true">break</normalised> Gods <normalised orig="Commandement" auto="true">Commandment</normalised>, promised <lb/>

in the <normalised orig="wildernesse" auto="true">wilderness</normalised>, promised to give him <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 4.8">all the <normalised orig="Kingdomes" auto="true">Kingdoms</normalised> <lb/>
of the world and the glory of them.</quote>
                  <lb/>
And that you may the better avoid their <normalised orig="inchantments" auto="true">enchantments</normalised>, <lb/>
I will <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> you the method they use in deceiving. <lb/>
As first, they endeavour to separate the <normalised orig="sheepe" auto="true">sheep</normalised> <lb/>
from their <normalised orig="Shepheards" auto="true">Shepherds</normalised>, bringing them into contempt <lb/>
with their people, affirming them to be unprofitable, <lb/>
unpowerfull, taxing their conversations as <normalised orig="prophane" auto="true">profane</normalised>, <lb/>
and doctrine as erroneous: Thus smiting your <normalised orig="Shepheards" auto="true">Shepherds</normalised> <lb/>
with their tongues, they draw you to their <lb/>
Conventicles. <lb/>
2. To palliate their errors, they pervert the holy <lb/>
Scriptures, as that Monster Arrius pretended to have <lb/>
42. places of <choice ana="typeset-error">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr>Scripture</corr>
                  </choice> against the Deity of Christ, &amp; <lb/>
this he learnt of his father the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, who perverted <lb/>
part of the 91. <normalised orig="Psalme" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>, to tempt our Lord to cast <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> from the <normalised orig="pinacle" auto="true">pinnacle</normalised> of the Temple. <lb/>
And for this cause these <normalised orig="Heretickes" auto="true">Heretics</normalised> are enemies to <lb/>
the ten <normalised orig="Commandements" auto="true">Commandments</normalised>, being some of the Law to <lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
the Creed being a <normalised orig="briefe" auto="true">brief</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Gospell" auto="true">Gospel</normalised>, and to the <lb/>
Lords Prayer, being a perfect <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of Prayer, <normalised orig="conteyning" auto="true">containing</normalised> <lb/>
all that can be asked or prayed against, by <lb/>
which only a simple man may discern any <normalised orig="Hereticke" auto="true">Heretic</normalised>, <lb/>
contradicting any <normalised orig="Commandement" auto="true">Commandment</normalised> of the decalogue, <lb/>
Article of the Faith, and Petition of the Lords Prayer. <lb/>
And for this cause the Church of Rome <normalised orig="teacheth" auto="true">teaches</normalised> <lb/>
the Laity them in <normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised>: and also they leave out part <lb/>
of the Decalogue in their <normalised orig="Catechismes" auto="true">Catechisms</normalised>: and for other <lb/>
<normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised>, some <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> null the whole Law, some the <lb/>
Creed, and others the Lords Prayer, affirming it to <lb/>
be <normalised orig="abhominable" auto="true">abominable</normalised>. <lb/>
<normalised orig="Againe" auto="true">Again</normalised>, whatsoever outward <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> they make of <lb/>
<normalised orig="holinesse" auto="true">holiness</normalised>, they are indeed <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 7.15">ravening wolves</quote>; <normalised orig="Therfore" auto="true">Therefore</normalised> <lb/>
our Lord <normalised orig="biddeth" auto="true">bids</normalised> us beware of them: The word beware <lb/>
<normalised orig="precedeth" auto="false">preceded</normalised> danger. As sheep are in danger among <lb/>
wolves, so are your <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised> in danger among false Prophets. <lb/>
The journey of the Israelites to the earthly Canaan, <lb/>
was a type of our journey to the heavenly. And did <lb/>
not one false prophet, Balaam, do them more mischief <lb/>
in their journey then Og the King of Bashan, Sehon <lb/>
King of the Amorites, and all their enemies besides? <lb/>
yea, would the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> in his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="likenesse" auto="true">likeness</normalised> <lb/>
have been more noxious to the Church of God then <lb/>
some <normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised> have been? As one <normalised orig="Heretick" auto="true">Heretic</normalised>, Arrius, <lb/>
denying the Deity of Christ, in a manner infected the <lb/>
whole world. <lb/>
The like did one other <normalised orig="Heretick" auto="true">Heretic</normalised> Eutyches, erring <lb/>
concerning his humanity, affirming the immensity of <lb/>
Christs divine nature to have swallowed up his humane. <lb/>
Now if Christ had not been man, how could <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">B</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
he have <normalised orig="dyed" auto="true">died</normalised> for us sinners? and if not God, how <lb/>
could he have wrought the salvation of man-kind? <lb/>
Alas, what danger are we in now, being <normalised orig="invironed" auto="true">environed</normalised> <lb/>
with such a multitude of <normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised>? Our Lord <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> <lb/>
us <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 7.20">by their fruits you shall know them</quote>: they <lb/>
pretend that they are led by the Spirit. The <normalised orig="workes" auto="true">works</normalised> <lb/>
of the Spirit St. Paul <normalised orig="setteth" auto="true">sets</normalised> forth to be love, joy, <lb/>
peace, long suffering, <normalised orig="gentlenesse" auto="true">gentleness</normalised>, <normalised orig="goodnesse" auto="true">goodness</normalised>, faith, <lb/>
<normalised orig="meekenesse" auto="true">meekness</normalised>, and temperance: If they were led by the <lb/>
holy Spirit, these would be their characters. But St. <lb/>
Paul <normalised orig="telleth" auto="true">tells</normalised> us that in the latter <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> there shall come <lb/>
men, lovers of their own selves, boasters, proud, cursed <lb/>
speakers, disobedient to Parents, <normalised orig="unthankeful" auto="false">unthankful</normalised>, unholy. <lb/>
Master Calvin, that admirable man of God, whose <lb/>
name is yet terrible in the <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> of Popery, <normalised orig="setteth" auto="true">sets</normalised> <lb/>
down <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> characters of these Impostors, taken <lb/>
out of St. Augustine: <lb/>
1. Great boasters, making ostentation of their <lb/>
<normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> worth like Simon Magus, who bewitched the <lb/>
people, saying, that he <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> was some great man: <lb/>
like the Gnostikes who had a high conceit of their <lb/>
own knowledge, as if they were the only knowing <lb/>
men of the whole world: their common <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> is of <lb/>
their own worth and actions. <lb/>
2. Superbia tumidi, blown up with pride, and among <lb/>
us many proud spirits having not these preferments <lb/>
which they thought themselves worthy of, <lb/>
have forsaken our Church, and gone to Rome and <lb/>
Amsterdam. <lb/>
3. Calumniis insidiosi, <normalised orig="deceitfull" auto="true">deceitful</normalised> slanderers: and <lb/>
in this faculty of all other Sects the Brownists <normalised orig="excell" auto="true">excel</normalised>: <lb/>
The <normalised orig="Iesuites" auto="true">Jesuits</normalised> are not so bitter against our Church as <lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
the Separatists, compare their writings. Michael the <lb/>
Arch-Angel durst not give the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> such cursed <lb/>
speaking, nor <normalised orig="raile" auto="true">rail</normalised> upon him as they <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> upon us and <lb/>
Gods Church. <lb/>
4. Treacherously seditious, not preaching peace as <lb/>
Christ commanded his Disciples to do, but division: <lb/>
yea, the Brownists arrogate to themselves the name of <lb/>
Separatists, which well they may, being separated <lb/>
from their Mother Church, from all the Reformed <lb/>
Churches, and <normalised orig="malitiously" auto="true">maliciously</normalised> divided among themselves. <lb/>
5. Lest they should seem to be destitute of the light <lb/>
of truth, they arrogate to themselves the shadow of <lb/>
austerity and <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> of <normalised orig="holinesse" auto="true">holiness</normalised>. <lb/>
6. Sacrilegious, what the appetite of all <normalised orig="Schismaticks" auto="true">Schismatics</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="bin" auto="true">been</normalised> in this way is notorious, caring not for <lb/>
the <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised> of the whole Church, upon condition that <lb/>
they might get some-what. They have so taught, <lb/>
that some <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> there is no such sin as <normalised orig="sacriledge" auto="true">sacrilege</normalised> at <lb/>
all. <lb/>
Our Lord fore-warning us of false prophets, and so <lb/>
lively describing them, and we having such characters <lb/>
and <normalised orig="markes" auto="true">marks</normalised> to know them: Thou understanding the <lb/>
Decalogue, Creed, and Lords Prayer: if thou be misled, <lb/>
thy <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised> will light upon thine own head. For is <lb/>
there any man so simple, but can tell when their Doctrines <lb/>
they reach <normalised orig="crosse" auto="true">cross</normalised> any of these? <lb/>
And one thing more will aggravate your defection <lb/>
before Almighty God, viz. Your Covenant &amp; Oath <lb/>
wherewith you bound your selves in the presence of <lb/>
God <choice ana="illegible">
