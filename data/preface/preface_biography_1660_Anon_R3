THE<lb/>
TRANSLATOR<lb/>
TO THE<lb/>
<normalised orig="CATHOLICK" auto="true">CATHOLIC</normalised> PROTESTANT,<lb/>
AND<lb/>
PAPAL READER.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Christian,<lb/>
I Need not desire of you,<lb/>
not to be offended at the<lb/>
Popery in this Book (as<lb/>
I my self were) because<lb/>
being <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>, you<lb/>
have received the <normalised orig="Vnction" auto="true">Unction</normalised> that <normalised orig="teacheth" auto="true">teaches</normalised><lb/>
you all things. And you know what in<lb/>
the Babel or Confusion of Articles of<lb/>
Faith, Rights, Religious Customs, Institutions<lb/>
and Ceremonies, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been from<lb/>
the Spirit of Christ, and now used (or<lb/>
                  <lb/>

                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
rather abused) by the Spirit of Antichrist;<lb/>
as likewise what <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been solely<lb/>
from the spirit of Antichrist, and never<lb/>
made use of by the Spirit of Christ.<lb/>
Protestant Christian Reader, be not<lb/>
offended (as I were) lest you lose the profit<lb/>
of this Treatise, as I had like to have<lb/>
done; you will meet with much Popery,<lb/>
and more Christianity, you may (for all<lb/>
me) condemn the former, so you do it<lb/>
knowingly; but prize the latter, for it is<lb/>
in this little Treatise as Savoury, as<lb/>
Fragrant, and as well Seasoned with<lb/>
Salt, as almost in any Treatise which<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been since the Apostles time.<lb/>
For the Popery in this Treatise, there<lb/>
want not those that say, that the most of<lb/>
it is spurious, and <normalised orig="father'd" auto="true">fathered</normalised> upon this highly<lb/>
illuminated Person, that under his<lb/>
Name it may have the better reputation.<lb/>
Martin Luther (the great and valiant<lb/>
Witness against Popish Tyranny<lb/>
and Superstition) gives this Author the<lb/>
Title of a Prophet, calling him Homo<lb/>
Dei, The Man of God. And our devout<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
Martyrologist, Mr. J. Fox, reckons him<lb/>
among those, who (to use his own words)<lb/>
stood in open defence of Truth against the<lb/>
disordered Church of Rome.<lb/>
Popish Christian Reader, do not<lb/>
boast that this greatly illuminated Theologist,<lb/>
was a Son of your Church, the<lb/>
People of God may be Captives in Babylon;<lb/>
and your Church with its enumerable<lb/>
Doctrines, Rights and Ceremonies, is no<lb/>
better if it be <normalised orig="voyd" auto="true">void</normalised> of the Spirit of Christ.<lb/>
What ever <normalised orig="Doctrins" auto="true">Doctrines</normalised>, Rights and Institutions,<lb/>
the Spirit of Christ <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> brought<lb/>
forth in the World, the same Spirit can<lb/>
only teach the profitable use of them; he<lb/>
that <normalised orig="practiseth" auto="true">practises</normalised> them without the guidance<lb/>
and illumination of that Spirit, <normalised orig="practiseth" auto="true">practises</normalised><lb/>
nothing but Bodily Exercise &amp; Will-Worship,<lb/>
which <normalised orig="profiteth" auto="true">profits</normalised> not. This holy<lb/>
Author exhorts you not to exercise your<lb/>
selves according to your own will in rigorous<lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*astings</sic>
                     <corr>Fastings</corr>
                  </choice>, Penances, Processions,<lb/>
Pilgrimages, and the like, but to resign<lb/>
your selves to the guidance and direction<lb/>
of the Holy Spirit of Christ, which shall<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 4</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
exercise you infinitely more profitably<lb/>
than if you should <normalised orig="enjoyn" auto="true">enjoin</normalised> your selves in<lb/>
your own Will and Resolution, all the Rigours<lb/>
and Hardships, even of all the<lb/>
Saints. But you will say, holy Church<lb/>
<normalised orig="enjoyns" auto="true">enjoins</normalised> us such and such Rights. That<lb/>
Church that labours not mainly and<lb/>
chiefly, that Children may be born unto<lb/>
God, of Water and of the Spirit; and afterwards<lb/>
instructs such new born Children<lb/>
in the exercise of this their new Life;<lb/>
instructing them in Rights conducing<lb/>
thereto; <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> no better than those, that<lb/>
should take not Children, but Apes to instruct<lb/>
in humane Arts and Sciences. He<lb/>
that <normalised orig="cometh" auto="true">comes</normalised> not to know the inward Cross<lb/>
and how to submit to it, and take it up<lb/>
<normalised orig="dayly" auto="true">daily</normalised>, and thereby grow in the knowledge<lb/>
of the Mysteries of it; in vain <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised><lb/>
he bow to an outward Cross of Wood or<lb/>
Stone, creep unto it, kiss it, say his Prayers<lb/>
before it, or bear it upon his back. If<lb/>
these things be any thing, it is because<lb/>
they are Figurative and Significative of<lb/>
the Mystery of the inward Cross: if they<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
teach not, nor express that, they are <normalised orig="meerly" auto="true">merely</normalised><lb/>
Bodily Labour and Will-Worship. The<lb/>
like may be said of most of the <normalised orig="Romish" auto="true">Roman</normalised><lb/>
Rights and Institutions, but it would be<lb/>
too tedious to use many Instances. But<lb/>
to conclude, if we did all learn to sink<lb/>
into that profound Humility, Self-denial,<lb/>
and Self-Inanition, which is every<lb/>
where taught in this Treatise, we might<lb/>
thereby even in enumerable things be advantaged;<lb/>
whereof two or three I will<lb/>
reckon and conclude.<lb/>
First, We may hereby come to be Divinely<lb/>
touched from above, and illuminated<lb/>
by the Spirit of God, so as to be<lb/>
able to see clearly what were the <normalised orig="Doctrins" auto="true">Doctrines</normalised>,<lb/>
Rights, Institutions, and Ceremonies,<lb/>
which the said Spirit taught the<lb/>
Primitive Church, before the removal<lb/>
of the Candlesticks; or <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> since taught<lb/>
his Church in the Wilderness: and contrariwise<lb/>
what <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been brought in by<lb/>
the spirit of Error, Confusion, and of Antichrist.<lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
And Secondly, We might see that<lb/>
spirit of Wrath, Fury, and bloody Discord,<lb/>
about Doctrines, Rights and Ceremonies,<lb/>
which <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a long while raged in<lb/>
the Christian World, be clearly discovered,<lb/>
hated, and banished.<lb/>
And Lastly, We might begin to discern<lb/>
the new Jerusalem make preparation<lb/>
to descend from Heaven; which will<lb/>
put a Period to all the Miseries and Sufferings<lb/>
of Gods faithful Ones, and begin<lb/>
their everlasting day of Happiness, Joy,<lb/>
and Peace: Which the Lord in great<lb/>
Compassion hasten.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="Farewel" auto="true">Farewell</normalised> heartily.<lb/>
