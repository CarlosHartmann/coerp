               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
THis Book was intended for the use <lb/>
of Poor Families which have neither <lb/>
money to buy many, nor time <lb/>
to read them: I much desired <lb/>
therefore to have made it shorter; <lb/>
But I could not do it, without <lb/>
leaving out that, which I think they cannot well <lb/>
spare. That which is spoken accurately and in <lb/>
few words, the ignorant understand not: And <lb/>
that which is large, they have neither money, <lb/>
leisure nor memory to make their own. Being <lb/>
unavoidably in this <normalised orig="streight" auto="true">straight</normalised>, the first remedy <normalised orig="lyeth" auto="true">lies</normalised> <lb/>
in your hands; I humbly propose it to you for the <lb/>
souls of men, and the comfort of your own, and <lb/>
the common good, on the behalf of Christ, the <lb/>
Saviour of your souls and theirs, that you will bestow <lb/>
one Book (either this or some fitter) upon as <lb/>
many poor families as you well can. If every <lb/>
Landlord would give one to every poor Tenant <lb/>
that he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised>, once in his life, out of one years <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 3</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
rent, it would be no great charge in comparison <lb/>
of the benefit which may be hoped for, and in <lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*parison</sic>
                     <corr>comparison</corr>
                  </choice> of what Prodigality <normalised orig="consumeth" auto="true">consumes</normalised>. The <lb/>
price of one ordinary dish of meat, will buy a <lb/>
Book: And to abate for every Tenant, but one <lb/>
dish in your lives, is no great <normalised orig="Self-denyal" auto="false">Self-denial</normalised>. If <lb/>
you indeed lay out all that you have better, I <lb/>
have done. If not, grudge not this little, to <lb/>
the poor, and to your selves: It will be more <lb/>
comfortable to your review, when the reckoning <lb/>
<normalised orig="cometh" auto="true">comes</normalised>, than that which is spent on Pomp, and <lb/>
Ceremony, <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*d</sic>
                     <corr>and</corr>
                  </choice> superfluities, and fleshly pleasures. <lb/>
And if Landlords (whose power with their Tenants <lb/>
is usually great) would also require them <lb/>
seriously to read it (at least on the Lords <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>) <lb/>
it may further the success. And I hope rich <lb/>
Citizens, and Ladies, and rich Women, who cannot <lb/>
themselves go talk to poor families, will send <lb/>
them such a messenger as thus, or some fitter <lb/>
Book, to instruct them, seeing no Preacher can <lb/>
be got at so cheap a rate. The Father of spirits, <lb/>
and the Redeemer of souls, <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> and assist us <lb/>
all, to work while it is day, and serve his Love <lb/>
and Grace, for our own and other <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> salvation. <lb/>
Amen. <lb/>
