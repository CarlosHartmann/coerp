To all Parents, Schoolmasters,<lb/>
or others, that<lb/>
are to train up young weaned<lb/>
children, and need direction;<lb/>
The Leader <lb/>
into all truth direct<lb/>
you. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
KNowing what account <lb/>
is to be <lb/>
given by all that <lb/>
profess themselves <lb/>
Christians,<lb/>

they endeavour not to (a)<lb/>
instruct such as they have<lb/>
charge of, to know and fear<lb/>
the Lord, and keep his ways, <lb/>
(a) Gen. 18 9.2 Tim. 1.5 ch.<lb/>
3.14. Deut. 6 9.6. Pro. 22.6. <lb/>
ch. 31. 1,2. And <normalised orig="rejoycing" auto="true">rejoicing</normalised><lb/>
much, that good use <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised><lb/>
been made of the <normalised orig="Catechismes" auto="true">Catechisms</normalised><lb/>
by Mr. Perkins, Mr. Elton, <lb/>
Mr. Egerton, Mr. Ball,<lb/>
Mr. Dan. Rogers, and others, <lb/>
for help to youths and elder <lb/>
people.<lb/>
Yet it clearly appearing,<lb/>
that in very many (if not in<lb/>
the most) of the Answers, <lb/>
are some things like <normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised>, <lb/>
or Greek to the younger, not<lb/>
being suited to their understandings,<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
as it were to be<lb/>
wished; I much desired to<lb/>
see one so plain and <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> in<lb/>
the expressions, as that the <lb/>
very Babes, that can speak <lb/>
but stammeringly, and are of<lb/>
very weak capacities, might<lb/>
understand what they say:<lb/>
and might have some help in<lb/>
Prayer and Thanksgiving to<lb/>
be with their understandings;<lb/>
and not as in a strange<lb/>
tongue, 1 Cor. 14.9, 15, 19.<lb/>
And not finding any such,<lb/>
I being desired to it, made<lb/>
an Assay above twelve years<lb/>
ago; and the Lord giving<lb/>
aid, and good success therein; <lb/>
and more Copies of it<lb/>
being desired than my time <lb/>
would permit to write over <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 4</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
and over again, having added<lb/>
and enlarged some passages, <lb/>
I have yielded to the <lb/>
desires of some that it might<lb/>
be printed for a more <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> <lb/>
good to many, that <lb/>
are very easily convinced of <lb/>
the great want of such, and <lb/>
of the great benefit to such <lb/>
little ones generally by such <lb/>
a plain, <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised>, familiar <normalised orig="Catechisme" auto="true">Catechism</normalised>;<lb/>
stammering(as it <lb/>
were) to their capacities, as <lb/>
the Lord is <normalised orig="pleas'd" auto="true">pleased</normalised> oftimes <lb/>
to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> to ours. And I have <lb/>
added herein, in a less letter, at <lb/>
this mark <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> this <lb/>
what may be forborn at<lb/>
first by the youngest Children,<lb/>
and may be learned by them afterwards.<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
If it be asked why the Answers<lb/>
are not put in this<lb/>
Black Letter, called English<lb/>
Letter? I answer; At first<lb/>
I had so intended: But <lb/>
for the <normalised orig="Childs" auto="true">Child's</normalised> far greater <lb/>
profit, and more ease, and <lb/>
for preventing the more toil <lb/>
in reading the Testament, <lb/>
Bible, and any <normalised orig="usuall" auto="true">usual</normalised> book, <lb/>
it's put in our most <normalised orig="usuall" auto="true">usual</normalised> <lb/>
letter; that English Letter <lb/>
being very <normalised orig="seldome" auto="true">seldom</normalised> now in <lb/>
use, may be learned with <lb/>
more ease afterwards.<lb/>
