                  <opener>SIR,</opener><lb/>
            <p> 
I. BY Letter you desire to have <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> <lb/>
unto you the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church <lb/>
distinct from the Church of Rome, <lb/>
and those in communion with her: <lb/>
which was at our meeting manifested <lb/>
as plainly, as we can <notvariant>dinstinguish</notvariant> <lb/>
the whole body from a particular <lb/>
member, or a particular <lb/>
member from the whole body. <lb/>
The body is one thing, the member another; the body <lb/>
is totum compositum, the whole <normalised orig="fabrick" auto="true">fabric</normalised>; the member but a <lb/>
part of it. And this is the particular Church of Rome to <lb/>
the whole <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>. Every member (as St. <normalised orig="Chrysostome" auto="true">Chrisostome</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="teacheth" auto="true">teaches</normalised>) <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a proper and a common <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised>: <lb/>
it <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> likewise a peculiar, and a common form or shape. <lb/>
The hand <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not the shape or strength of the whole <lb/>
man; and yet by the <normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> shape we know, it is a mans <lb/>
hand. And though we know the Church of Rome by her <lb/>
form, that is, by her Faith and Government, to be a <lb/>
Church; yet <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> she not the form or virtue of the <lb/>
whole Church, be she never so <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>. If she have, <lb/>
then must the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> borrow her life and being from <lb/>
Rome, and not Rome from the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>. If this particular <lb/>
had the virtue of the whole, then Timothy and <lb/>
Titus might not have given Orders, or censured Delinquents,<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 3</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/> 
                  <lb/>
or redressed what was <normalised orig="amisse" auto="true">amiss</normalised> at Ephesus and Crete, <lb/>
but by virtue of a Commission from the Church or <lb/>
Bishop of Rome. And yet St. Paul besought Timothy <lb/>
to abide at Ephesus, that he might charge some (those within <lb/>
his Diocese) that they teach no other doctrine then St. Paul <lb/>
had delivered. And for this cause left he Titus at Crete, <lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>t*at</sic>
                     <corr>that</corr>
                  </choice>he should <normalised orig="redresse" auto="true">redress</normalised> what was <normalised orig="amisse" auto="true">amiss</normalised>, and ordain <normalised orig="Presbyters" auto="false">Presbyterians</normalised>, <lb/>
as <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had appointed him; not as the Church of Rome <lb/>
directed him. And this was before he had visited that <lb/>
City. <lb/>
2. But if the Church of Rome be the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, <lb/>
Where was the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church before she became a <lb/>
Church? Was there one; or was there none? If one, <lb/>
then was not that the <normalised orig="Romane" auto="true">Roman</normalised>; since there was yet no <lb/>
such Church. If none, what were those Churches <lb/>
throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria? This <lb/>
was before the Apostles parted from one another to <lb/>
teach all Nations: hitherto we find them in these quarters, <lb/>
and no other. And yet at that time the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> <lb/>
Church was in being, <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> the Apostles Creed deceive <lb/>
us. For what was framed at Jerusalem, before the <lb/>
Apostles went about their great work. And for this <lb/>
end was it made, that it might be credentibus regula, <lb/>
a rule for <normalised orig="beleevers" auto="true">believers</normalised>; whosoever became Christian, he was <lb/>
to <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church: which he could not <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised>, <lb/>
if it were not in being. <lb/>
3. Secondly, if Rome be the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, then if <lb/>
she be Orthodox, the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church is Orthodox; if <lb/>
she be <normalised orig="Hereticall" auto="true">Heretical</normalised> of <normalised orig="Schismaticall" auto="true">Schismatic</normalised>, the whole Church <lb/>
must be <normalised orig="Hereticall" auto="true">Heretical</normalised> or <normalised orig="Schismaticall" auto="true">Schismatic</normalised>, as she is. So the <lb/>
Church shall take denomination from her; with her she <lb/>
shall stand and fall. Great reason then we should have <lb/>
an eye to Rome, and <normalised orig="relie" auto="true">rely</normalised> upon her. But this Church <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been miserably <normalised orig="Schismaticall" auto="true">Schismatic</normalised> and <normalised orig="Hereticall" auto="true">Heretical</normalised>. <normalised orig="Schismaticall" auto="true">Schismatic</normalised>; <lb/>
as is to be seen in Platina and Onuphrius; when <lb/>
she had sometimes two, sometimes three Bishops together; <lb/>
a double, a treble-headed, a monstrous Church. <lb/>
Whereas in one City there ought to be but one <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/> 
                  <lb/>
Bishop. That she <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been sufficiently <normalised orig="hereticall" auto="true">heretical</normalised>, is <lb/>
confessed by your own men. And as long as she was in <lb/>
this state, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was no Church; Hæresis enim Christi <lb/>
sponsa non est, <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised> is no Spouse of Christ; her members <lb/>
not so much as Christians; if we may <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> Tertull. <lb/>
and St. Cyprian. And St. Austin saith Hæretici non pertinent <lb/>
ad Ecclesiam Catholicam; <normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised> <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> not so much as <lb/>
belong to the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church. So then they that <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> <lb/>
Rome to be <normalised orig="Hereticall" auto="true">Heretical</normalised>, grant her to be no Church. And <lb/>
yet who dares say, that the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church was <normalised orig="Schismaticall" auto="true">Schismatic</normalised> <lb/>
or <normalised orig="Hereticall" auto="true">Heretical</normalised>, because Rome was so? This <lb/>
were to deny, to destroy the Church. For if <normalised orig="Schismaticall" auto="true">Schismatic</normalised>, <lb/>
she is no body, but shivers. If <normalised orig="Hereticall" auto="true">Heretical</normalised> in the chief <lb/>
<normalised orig="fundamentalls" auto="false">fundamentals</normalised>, at least, Where's the Church? <normalised orig="Unlesse" auto="true">Unless</normalised>, <lb/>
as there were false Apostles, so <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> will have false <lb/>
Churches. Such Churches we will have nothing to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> <lb/>
with, <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> it be to pray for them, and to advise them <lb/>
to remember, from whence they are fallen, to repent, and <lb/>
to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> their first works. <lb/>
4. Thirdly, if Rome be the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, if any <lb/>
thing be <normalised orig="amisse" auto="true">amiss</normalised> in any particular, the fault is hers, and <lb/>
she ought to mend it. If any mans hand fester, or foot <lb/>
be lame, if a remedy be not sought, the foot or hand <lb/>
are not blamed, but the man, because in time they <lb/>
were not looked to. The reason is, because not the <lb/>
hand or foot, but the man <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> both discretion and <lb/>
power to provide a remedy for every member, that is <lb/>
<normalised orig="amisse" auto="true">amiss</normalised>. Thus is it with the Church. This is enough to <lb/>
give any <normalised orig="rationall" auto="true">rational</normalised> Christian satisfaction, that Rome is <lb/>
not the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church. More I should not have written; <lb/>
but that you charge me with <normalised orig="certian" auto="false">certain</normalised> Propositions; <lb/>
which, you presume may stand you in much stead, to <lb/>
prove the contrary. I shall <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>shall shall</sic>
                     <corr>shall</corr>
                  </choice> therefore descend to the <lb/>
Propositions, and your Inferences drawn from thence. <lb/>
The first whereof is this, as you are pleased to pen <lb/>
them. <lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/> 
                  <lb/>
You grant the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church to be always (viz.)<lb/>
from the Apostles time to this time, visible. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
5. I <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> so, both in and from the Apostles time to this <lb/>
present day. But I <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> not say, that it was always <lb/>
visible in one and the same place; no, not at Rome it <lb/>
<normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, you think so well of. It <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been more then <lb/>
once, even in that very City under a bushel. The Sun <lb/>
it self is so often under a cloud, that it is not seen in <lb/>
these parts; and yet visible it is in other places. <lb/>
The Church is likened to the Sun, which <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> many <lb/>
<normalised orig="rayes" auto="true">rays</normalised>, and yet but one light. That light is not always <lb/>
in the same place, it removes with the Sun: the beams <lb/>
may decay, but the Sun it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> and the light thereof <lb/>
cannot perish. The Church <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> fruitfully <normalised orig="encreased" auto="true">increased</normalised> <lb/>
far and wide into a multitude: but how many of these <lb/>
have crumbled into nothing? It is much like the Sea, <lb/>
which <normalised orig="loseth" auto="true">loses</normalised> in one place, and gains in another, and <lb/>
yet continues the same Sea. Adulierari non potest Sponsa <lb/>
Christi, incorrupta est, &amp; pudica; the Spouse of Christ <lb/>
cannot be corrupted. Corrupt our selves we may, and <lb/>
depart from her integrity; but we cannot rob her of her <lb/>
essence, or integrity. <lb/>
6. The Church of God, I say, is always visible, and yet <lb/>
not to every eye: sometimes it is invisible not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> to <lb/>
ordinary eyes, but even to the best of men. Elijah <lb/>
himself complained to the Lord, that he, even he <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <lb/>
was left alone to serve the Lord: whereas all other, in <lb/>
his esteem, were become Idolaters; no face of a Church <lb/>
left in all Israel. But the Prophet was mistaken, the <lb/>
Lord assures him, that there were 7000 in Israel, <lb/>
whose knees had never bowed to Baal. And yet God <lb/>
tells him not where, nor what their names. A visible <lb/>
Church there was at that time, though not visible to Elijah. <lb/>
Visible it was to Obadiah, and to them that met in <lb/>
private Congregations (as in times of persecution, and <lb/>
with us at this day) these knew one another. And if <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/> 
                  <lb/>
that great Prophet could not discern the Church in his <lb/>
own days, and <normalised orig="countrey" auto="true">country</normalised>; would you have me, who <lb/>
am no such Prophet, to point out, where the Church <lb/>
was, when the Western parts were over-run with Popish <lb/>
errors? Though I be not able to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> where, yet it is <lb/>
more then <normalised orig="propable" auto="false">probable</normalised>, that there were in this very Island <lb/>
7000 souls, that were not tainted with those errors. <lb/>
It is enough for us to prove them to be errors, to be <lb/>
against Scriptures, and the received sense of the Ancient <lb/>
Church; and to cleanse our selves from them. <lb/>
7. Certainly, under the Law God was not without <lb/>
a Church in Judah. Yet <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> me, he that can, where <lb/>
the visible Church was, when Rehobam forsook the <lb/>
Law of the Lord, and all Israel with him. When the <lb/>
Prophet complained, that <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Chr 15.3">for a long season Israel had <lb/>
been without the true God, without a teaching Priest, and without <lb/>
the Law.</quote> When Ahaz shut up the <normalised orig="dores" auto="true">doors</normalised> of the <lb/>
Temple, and made Altars for false Gods in every corner <lb/>
of Jerusalem, and in the Cities of Judah. When in <lb/>
the Courts of the Lords house, Manasseh built Altars <lb/>
for all the host of heaven: Had God at that time no <lb/>
visible Church, think you? or were those ignorant, <normalised orig="faithlesse" auto="true">faithless</normalised>, <lb/>
idolatrous wretches the visible Church? Neither <lb/>
of these can be; needs therefore must God in those days <lb/>
have a visible Church, though the Scripture <normalised orig="expresseth" auto="true">expresses</normalised> <lb/>
not where, nor who they were. And can we expect, <lb/>
that mans writings should be more exact then Gods <lb/>
records? <lb/>
8. But God made a promise to the Apostles, that  <lb/>
he would be with them <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised>, and with their successors, <lb/>
to the end of the world. He did so; and without question <lb/>
he made good his promise, although he were neither <lb/>
with Liberius, Honorius, nor John 22. I have <lb/>
learned of Gregory Naz. to distinguish <lb/>
between successors in place, and successors <lb/>
in faith. He will be with those that succeed <lb/>
in faith and function; not with <lb/>
those that succeed in function <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, and <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">B</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/> 
                  <lb/>
not in faith. Let him sit in what throne he will, he <lb/>
is an adversary to Christ, if he be not a successor in the <lb/>
Orthodox faith. He that succeeds St. Peter, or any good <lb/>
Bishop, and is of a contrary Religion, he succeeds <lb/>
them, just as a disease follows health, as <normalised orig="darknesse" auto="true">darkness</normalised> <lb/>
follows light, and <normalised orig="frenzie" auto="true">frenzy</normalised> steps into the chair of <normalised orig="wisdome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised>. <lb/>
9. Boast not too much of this promise: the like was <lb/>
made to the former Priesthood. To Phineas the Lord <lb/>
bequeathed the Covenant of an everlasting Priesthood; that is, <lb/>
to him and his seed, as long as that law was to endure. <lb/>
And yet we see, that for a long season Israel was without <lb/>
the true God, without a teaching Priest, and without the <lb/>
Law. Where then was the Church? where the Promise? <lb/>
Urijah the High-Priest built that <normalised orig="Altare" auto="true">Altar</normalised> Damascenum, <lb/>
that abominable Altar, according to the pattern <lb/>
of that at Damascus. On that he offered, and did <lb/>
many other things contrary to Gods law. Abiathar <lb/>
was a <normalised orig="Traitour" auto="true">Traitor</normalised>;  Jason a Simoniack, and a <normalised orig="prophane" auto="true">profane</normalised> <lb/>
wretch; and Menelaus one of the veryest beasts that <lb/>
ever lived. Where was then the Priesthood? where the <lb/>
true Religion? And yet we dare not say, that God <lb/>
failed of his promise, or wanted a visible true Church <lb/>
in those <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>. But if it be inquired in whom, and <lb/>
where; it will be an hard matter for either or both of <lb/>
us to manifest. Truth it is, God will continue a Church, <lb/>
though <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> people and Priests abuse it. He, and <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> he, <lb/>
can discern, and distinguish the wheat from the <normalised orig="chaffe" auto="true">chafe</normalised>, <lb/>
and those few in Sardis, that had not defiled their <lb/>
garments, from the multitude that had. The world <lb/>
groaned, and <normalised orig="wondred" auto="true">wondered</normalised> to see it self all Arian. But God <lb/>
sees not as man sees; at that time he had a Church, <lb/>
and his eyes beheld it; though it were very difficult <lb/>
for man to point it out. Visible it was to some, and <lb/>
those not over many. Thus much for the Visibility of <lb/>
the Church. <lb/>
10. It is time now to look toward the second proposition, <lb/>
wherewith you charge me; which is this, <lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/> 
                  <lb/>
You say, the Church of Rome, and those in communion <lb/>
with her, are not the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, because <lb/>
they have grievously erred, and in one <normalised orig="fundamentall" auto="true">fundamental</normalised> <lb/>
at least.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
What ever I said, I am sure, I have manifested, that <lb/>
the Church of Rome, and those particular Churches in her <lb/>
communion, are not, cannot be, the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, no <lb/>
more then some parts of man may be said to be the <lb/>
whole man, or some parts of an house to be the <lb/>
whole house. But as for the reason, which you impose <lb/>
upon me, I am certain, I never gave it. I never said, <lb/>
these were not the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, because they have grievously <lb/>
erred, and  in one <normalised orig="fundamentall" auto="true">fundamental</normalised> at least. This reason <lb/>
was not, could not be given for that purpose; neither <lb/>
was it <normalised orig="needfull" auto="true">needful</normalised>, or <normalised orig="usefull" auto="true">useful</normalised>. For had it never erred, the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> it could not be, a <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> it might be; a part, <lb/>
but not the whole. If these, you speak of, be the whole, <lb/>
all other are excluded: and that, your party most uncharitably <lb/>
<normalised orig="aimes" auto="true">aims</normalised> at. Take Rome at the best, at the highest, <lb/>
she <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> her <normalised orig="priviledges" auto="true">privileges</normalised> among many; not over all: other <lb/>
Provinces must enjoy theirs. And divers Bishops have as <lb/>
large territories, as ever justly had your Pope of Rome. <lb/>
He that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a desire to know the truth of this, let him <lb/>
consult the 6 Canon of Nice; the 2 &amp; 3 of <normalised orig="Constantinople" auto="false">Constantine</normalised>; <lb/>
the 28 of Calcedon, with the 28 &amp; 125 Canons of <lb/>
the African Code: and he shall quickly discern, that Rome <lb/>
in those days was no such wondrous Church. She, <lb/>
no <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> then others, had her bounds, which she might <lb/>
not <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised>. <lb/>
11. But, I remember, well, I said, that if there were <lb/>
no other cause, then the maiming of the Lords Supper, <lb/>
I could not communicate with the Church of Rome. <lb/>
The reason is, because our Saviour ordained it to be <lb/>
given in both kinds; and <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> have most sacrilegiously <lb/>
robbed the Laity of his blood. By this means <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> make <lb/>
the people unfit for <normalised orig="martyrdome" auto="true">martyrdom</normalised>, if St. Cyprian mistake <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">B 2</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/> 
                  <lb/>
not. Quomodo (saith that Father) ad martyrii poculum<lb/>
idoneos facimus, si non eos ad BIBENDUM prius in Ecclesia <lb/>
POCULUM DOMINI jure communicationis admittimus? 
                  <lb/>
How can we make them fit for the cup of <normalised orig="Martyrdome" auto="true">Martyrdom</normalised>, <lb/>
if first in the Church we <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> not by right of communion <lb/>
admit them to DRINK THE CUP OF THE <lb/>
LORD? And <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, Quomodo possumus propter <lb/>
Christum sanguinem fundere, qui sanguinem Christi erubescimus <lb/>
bibere? No, may the people say, we are not ashamed to <lb/>
drink it; but <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> are ashamed to give it us to drink; at <lb/>
least to acknowledge the <normalised orig="wronk" auto="false">wrong</normalised>, that <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> have done us. <lb/>
We have a right to drink it, but <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> have barred us from <lb/>
our right. Thus <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> have gone against the sense and <lb/>
practice of the Primitive Church. <normalised orig="Yee" auto="true">Ye</normalised> have also departed <lb/>
from the Institution of Christ, from which the <lb/>
Sacraments receive their force and virtue. What efficacy <lb/>
then can your half Sacrament be of? <lb/>
12. But for your further satisfaction, I <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised>; First, <lb/>
The Church of Rome, and those in communion with her, are <lb/>
not the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church exclusive, solely excluding others; <lb/>
however divers of that faction appropriate that title to <lb/>
them. And yet we grant Rome herself to be a Church,<lb/>
that is, a member of the one <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>, though an <normalised orig="erronious" auto="true">erroneous</normalised> <lb/>
member; as a vicious man is a man, or as an ulcerous <lb/>
member is a part of the body. Though we see her <lb/>
errors, we deny not her essence; but wish she were cleansed <lb/>
from her corruptions. Secondly, a particular Church <lb/>
cannot by styled the <normalised orig="Universall" auto="true">Universal</normalised>, and <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> signifies nothing <lb/>
else; no more then Socrates can be said to be Homo <lb/>
in specie, all, or the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> man. Neither can we affirm, <lb/>
that man is the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> animal, the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> sensitive creature, <lb/>
though the most excellent. Yet in the third place, <lb/>
though we deny you to be the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>, we acknowledge <lb/>
you to be a Church. For that Church, which receives the <lb/>
Scripture as a Rule of faith, though but as a <normalised orig="partiall" auto="true">partial</normalised> and imperfect <lb/>
Rule; and both the Sacraments as <normalised orig="instrumentall" auto="true">instrumental</normalised> causes and seals of <lb/>
grace, though they <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised> more, and misuse these; yet cannot but be <lb/>
a true Church in essence. <lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/> 
                  <lb/>
13. It is not then every abuse of Scripture and Sacraments; <lb/>
but the razing of the foundation, that <lb/>
<normalised orig="ruines" auto="true">ruins</normalised> a Church, and makes that to be none, <lb/>
which heretofore was one. Of the essence of <lb/>
the Church, I take to be these two; the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> faith, and the <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="false">Apostolic</normalised> government. <lb/>
The former is the soul of the Church, and <lb/>
gives it life; the other is as the sinews thereof, <lb/>
which knit the members together firmly into <lb/>
one body. Without the former it is built <lb/>
upon sand; and without the other it cannot <lb/>
last. Without the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> faith we cannot please <lb/>
God; and without a Bishop the Sacraments will quickly <lb/>
cease. Yea the very communion of the Church must fail; <lb/>
since, according to St. Austin's rule, we may not so <lb/>
much as hold communion with any, that have not <normalised orig="Episcopall" auto="true">Episcopal</normalised> <lb/>
Sees. Since then <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> <normalised orig="professe" auto="true">profess</normalised> the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> faith, and <lb/>
continue the <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="false">Apostolic</normalised> government, though <normalised orig="mixt" auto="true">mixed</normalised> with corruptions <lb/>
and encroachments, we grant you to be <lb/>
a true, but not Orthodox Church. For Orthodox Christians <lb/>
are keepers of integrity, and followers of right <lb/>
things. Of which the Church of Rome is neither. <lb/>
14. If then, according to your charge, I did say, <lb/>
that the <normalised orig="Romane" auto="true">Roman</normalised> Church had grievously erred, and in one <normalised orig="fundamentall" auto="true">fundamental</normalised> <lb/>
at least; yet as then, so now, I am, have been, <lb/>
and ever shall be loath, to deny her to be a true Church; <lb/>
since without the Church, no salvation. If you will make <lb/>
her no Church, or a false Church, and put your selves <lb/>
out of all hope, I can pity you, but not help it. Indeed, <lb/>
the pride of that See is such, she will be all, or <lb/>
nothing; either the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>, or no Church. It is not <lb/>
therefore to her content, to <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic><normalised orig="yeild" auto="true">yield</normalised></sic>
                     <corr>yield</corr>
                  </choice> her to be a Church, since <lb/>
that <normalised orig="implyes" auto="true">implies</normalised> no more, then that she is a member of the <lb/>
whole. Alas, the <normalised orig="Universall" auto="true">Universal</normalised> she cannot be; that consists <lb/>
of many Churches, as the whole earth consists of many <lb/>
lands and <normalised orig="countreys" auto="true">countries</normalised>; and yet but one Earth, and one <lb/>
Church. Neither of them is couped up, or confined <lb/>
within the largest Continent. For my part, I <normalised orig="professe" auto="true">profess</normalised> <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">B 3</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/> 
                  <lb/>
with St. Austin, that I am in that Church, cuius membra <lb/>
sunt omnes illae Ecclesie, quas ex laboribus Apostolorum natus <lb/>
atque firmatas simul in literis canonicis novimus, the members <lb/>
whereof are all those Churches, which in Scripture we know to <lb/>
have been planted and confirmed by the Apostles industry. And <lb/>
their communion, with Gods assistance, I shall never <lb/>
forsake, whether in England, or elsewhere; <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> <lb/>
these forsake the truth. I shall never leave the <normalised orig="Universall" auto="true">Universal</normalised> <lb/>
to side with any particular Church. And I would advise <lb/>
your Masters to take heed, lest while, with the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Dogge" auto="true">Dog</normalised> in the Fable, they catch at too much, they <lb/>
lose all. <lb/>
15. The Church (according to St. Cyprian) is like <lb/>
a Tree, whose boughs are many, but the body one, <lb/>
firmly rooted. Ab <normalised orig="arbore" auto="true">arbor</normalised> frange ramum, fructus germinare <lb/>
non poterit; break the best <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised> from this body, it will <lb/>
bear no fruit for heaven; the branch it self will wither, <lb/>
and rot, and come to nothing. <normalised orig="Hath" auto="true">Has</normalised> that Church, you <lb/>
speak of, been heretofore a glorious and happy Church? <lb/>
Glory not too much in that, boast not over the rest of <lb/>
the branches, that have been <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> <normalised orig="successefull" auto="true">successful</normalised>; <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 11.18">thou <normalised orig="bearest" auto="true">bear</normalised> <lb/>
not the root, but the root thee;</quote> thou art but <normalised orig="graffed" auto="true">gruffed</normalised> in, as <lb/>
the rest were: and <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 11.17">with them thou <normalised orig="partakest" auto="true">partake</normalised> of the root <lb/>
and fatness of the olive tree.</quote> Remember also, though there <lb/>
be many branches, yet there is but one <normalised orig="originall" auto="true">original</normalised>, one <lb/>
root, that <normalised orig="yeelds" auto="true">yields</normalised> sap, and life, and fruit to every bough, <lb/>
great or small. Suppose thou be the top-bough, yet <lb/>
rend not, suffer not thy <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> to be rent, from this body. <lb/>
Take heed of this, lest thou become <normalised orig="fewell" auto="true">fuel</normalised> for that <normalised orig="dreadfull" auto="true">dreadful</normalised> <lb/>
fire. <lb/>
16. That the Church of Rome <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> grievously and dangerously <lb/>
erred, I need no witnesses but your own family. <lb/>
Stapleton justifies, that there is scarce any sin, that can <lb/>
be thought by man (<normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised> <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> excepted) with which that <lb/>
See <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not been foully stained; especially from the 800 years <lb/>
after Christ. But Stella, and Almain grant freely, <lb/>
that some of the Bishops of Rome did fall into <normalised orig="heresie" auto="true">heresy</normalised>; <lb/>
and so ceased to be heads of the Church. And though <lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/> 
                  <lb/>
some of that Churches errors at this day be dangerous to <lb/>
salvation, yet that judicious Bishop, I then <normalised orig="spake" auto="true">spoke</normalised> of, <lb/>
would not venture to set down, what errors in doctrine may <lb/>
give just cause of separation in this body, or the parts of it one <lb/>
from another. Neither shall I, by Gods grace, be over-bold <lb/>
in this point. <lb/>
17. The points <normalised orig="fundamentall" auto="true">fundamental</normalised> are contained in the Creed; <lb/>
which is (as the <normalised orig="Councell" auto="true">Council</normalised> of Trent speaks) Et fundamentum <lb/>
firmum &amp; unicum, not the firm alone, but the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <lb/>
foundation. And Bellarmine resolves, that All things <lb/>
simply necessary for all <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> salvation, are expressed in the Creed <lb/>
and Decalogue. If <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> have erred in any of these, and <lb/>
grown obstinate in this error, <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> are become an <normalised orig="Hereticall" auto="true">Heretical</normalised> <lb/>
Church in battering the foundation. And yet we must take <lb/>
notice, that every thing <normalised orig="fundamentall" auto="true">fundamental</normalised> is not of a like <lb/>
<normalised orig="neernesse" auto="true">nearness</normalised> to the foundation, nor of <normalised orig="equall" auto="true">equal</normalised> primenesse in the faith. <lb/>
For there are quædam prima credibilia, certain prime <lb/>
principles of faith, in the <normalised orig="bosome" auto="true">bosom</normalised> whereof all other Articles <lb/>
lie wrapped and folded up. What ever Church denies <lb/>
or <normalised orig="disbeleives" auto="false">disbelieves</normalised> any of these, <normalised orig="ceaseth" auto="true">cease</normalised> to be not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> Orthodox, <lb/>
but <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>, and so no member of the true Church; <lb/>
since <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Jn 4.3">every spirit, that <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised> not that Jesus Christ is <lb/>
come in the flesh, is not of God</quote>, but is that spirit of Antichrist.<lb/>
Now, if <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> have at any time denied this Jesus Christ <lb/>
to be <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Jn 5.20">the true God and <normalised orig="eternall" auto="true">eternal</normalised> life,</quote> <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> were at that time no <lb/>
Church, but an Antichristian Synagogue. But this did <lb/>
Marcellinus, and Liberius, and John 22. (all Bishops of Rome). <lb/>
In those times therefore <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> were no Church, but <lb/>
an Antichristian Synagogue. Heresis enim Christi <lb/>
Sponsa non est since <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised> is not the Spouse of Christ. <lb/>
18. If you doubt of the Minor, Stella makes that good; <lb/>
for he testifies, that Marcellinus sacrificed to Idols; that <lb/>
Liberius assented to the Arians; that is, he <normalised orig="denyed" auto="true">denied</normalised> our Saviour <lb/>
to be of one and the same substance with the Father: <lb/>
and that John 22. affirmed, that God the Son is greater <lb/>
then the Father and the Holy Ghost. These batter and <lb/>
undermine the foundation; which whatever Congregation <lb/>
does, it <normalised orig="apostatizeth" auto="false">apostatizes</normalised>, and is no Church. While then Rome <lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/> 
                  <lb/>
did, and <normalised orig="beleeved" auto="true">believed</normalised> thus, neither she, nor any of those <lb/>
that communicated with her in these, or any of these <lb/>
heresies, were so much as a Church, much <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church. Especially since all these are contrary <lb/>
to the Creed and <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> faith: which faith except <lb/>
every one <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he <lb/>
shall perish everlastingly. This Creed our Church appeals <lb/>
to, whether <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>, or not <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>; this is the faith <lb/>
she desires to be saved by. He, that faithfully <normalised orig="beleives" auto="true">believes</normalised> this <lb/>
Creed, is a <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>; but he, that <normalised orig="beleives" auto="true">believes</normalised> it not, is no <lb/>
<normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>, neither can he be saved. I am one of Athanasius <lb/>
his <normalised orig="Catholicks" auto="true">Catholics</normalised>; and with Gods blessing I shall <lb/>
live and die so. <lb/>
19. But I know, what you drive at. You were pleased <lb/>

                     <sic>toask</sic>
                     <corr>to ask</corr>
                  </choice>, where our Church was before the Reformation? <lb/>
It was <normalised orig="answer'd" auto="true">answered</normalised>, in the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>. Next, you inquired, <lb/>
whether the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> were <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> visible? The reply <lb/>
was affirmative; both here, and in other places. But before <lb/>
the Reformation we communicated with Rome; and <lb/>
since we have not. That's no fault of ours; <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> will not <lb/>
suffer us to communicate with you, <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> we <normalised orig="communciate" auto="false">communicate</normalised> <lb/>
with your errors. And yet we shall, <normalised orig="maugre" auto="false">meagre</normalised> Satan, <lb/>
communicate with the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, while <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 15.6">with one mind and one mouth we <normalised orig="glorifie" auto="true">glorify</normalised> God, even the Father of <lb/>
our Lord Jesus Christ,</quote> according to this, the Nicene, and the <lb/>
Apostles Creed. While we pray for the Church <normalised orig="Universall" auto="true">Universal</normalised>, <lb/>
and for all Bishops, Pastors, and Curates thereof: <lb/>
While we pray for all Gods people; for all that have erred, <lb/>
and are deceived; even for our enemies, persecutors, <lb/>
and slanderers: While we continue the <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="false">Apostolic</normalised> government; <lb/>
and while we not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> receive, but administer <lb/>
the Sacraments according to Christs holy Ordinance, <lb/>
we shall be in the communion of the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> <lb/>
Church. <lb/>
20. Truth it is, as that judicious Bishop told Mr. Fisher, <lb/>
the cause of the <normalised orig="Schisme" auto="true">Schism</normalised> is yours; for <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> thrust us from <lb/>
you, because we called for Truth, and <normalised orig="redresse" auto="true">redress</normalised> of abuses. What <lb/>
was then to be done? must we swallow untruths, and <lb/>
                  <pb n="12"/> 
                  <lb/>
wink at abuses, that we may collogue and communicate <lb/>
with you? It had not wont to be so; every Province <lb/>
had wont to reform it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>. And so she did not <normalised orig="transgresse" auto="true">transgress</normalised> <lb/>
the Faith or Canons of the Church <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>, the <lb/>
reformation was both <normalised orig="legall" auto="true">legal</normalised> and commendable. We did <lb/>
so with our Provinces, following therein the ancient <lb/>
Canons of the Church, which assure us, that every <lb/>
<normalised orig="Provinciall" auto="true">Provincial</normalised> Synod is to order all things within the Province. <lb/>
And for full satisfaction, those Fathers of Constantinople <lb/>
<normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> this Canon by the Decrees of the Nicene <normalised orig="Councel" auto="true">Council</normalised>. <lb/>
Indeed sometimes it may happen, that the <normalised orig="businesse" auto="true">business</normalised> <lb/>
will prove to be of such consequence and circumspection, <lb/>
that a <normalised orig="Provinciall" auto="true">Provincial</normalised> Synod is not fit to determine it. <lb/>
What is then to be done? That very Canon says, in <lb/>
such a case we must not make our <normalised orig="addresse" auto="true">address</normalised> to a <normalised orig="Generall" auto="true">General</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="Councel" auto="true">Council</normalised>; but to a greater Synod of the Bishops of that <lb/>
Diocese, called together for that purpose. But we must <lb/>
observe, that in the ancient both Civil and Ecclesiastical <lb/>
<normalised orig="acceptation" auto="true">acceptance</normalised>, a Diocese contains in it many Provinces. <lb/>
This <normalised orig="Councel" auto="true">Council</normalised> we ought not to decline, by molesting <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Emperour" auto="true">Emperor</normalised>, or any secular Magistrates, with <lb/>
complaints; as our late Ministers have done. This is <lb/>
not <normalised orig="canonicall" auto="true">canonical</normalised>, and the complaint is not to be admitted. <lb/>
We are therefore to take notice, that the three Britains <lb/>
were a Diocese of themselves, and had a  Præfectus Prætorio <lb/>
for Civil, and a Primate for Ecclesiastical <normalised orig="affaires" auto="true">affairs</normalised>. <lb/>
The Primate or Patriarch is the Archbishop of Canterbury. <lb/>
So then our Reformation is not after any new, or lately <lb/>
invented model; it is according to the ancient course <lb/>
and canons of the Church; and therefore justifiable. If <lb/>
we had taken any other course in our Reformation, we <lb/>
had done <normalised orig="amisse" auto="true">amiss</normalised>. For according to the <normalised orig="Councel" auto="true">Council</normalised> of Constantinople, <lb/>
we had run into an high contemot; 1. by slighting <lb/>
all the Bishops in this Diocese; 2. by injuring the <lb/>
Canons; and 3. by subverting the <normalised orig="Ecclesiasticall" auto="true">Ecclesiastical</normalised> order <lb/>
and government. <lb/>
21. In submission to these Canons, the Church did usually <lb/>
reform both in manners and faith, by Diocesan or <normalised orig="Provinciall" auto="true">Provincial</normalised> <lb/>

                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="Councels" auto="true">Counsels</normalised>: as is to be seen in the Code of the Universal <lb/>
Church, in the African Code, in Balsamon and Zonaras, in the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Councels" auto="true">Counsels</normalised> of Spain, and in the <normalised orig="Councels" auto="true">Counsels</normalised> of England, set <lb/>
forth by that pious and worthy Knight Sir Henry Spelman. <lb/>
Much in this kind is readily presented to every eye by our <lb/>
learned Archbishop § 24. n. 4. Where you may see this <lb/>
course approved by your own learned men, Albertus <lb/>
Magnus, and that famous <normalised orig="Chancellour" auto="true">Chancellor</normalised> of Paris, to be <lb/>
not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised>, but sometimes necessary. Indeed to <lb/>
what purpose is it, to <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> that to be a full, a perfect <lb/>
Synod, wherein a Metropolitan is present, if it may not <lb/>
upon just occasion amend, what is <normalised orig="amisse" auto="true">amiss</normalised> within her own <lb/>
precincts? What is it then a perfect Synod for? Otherwise <lb/>
Israel must not have reformed without Judah, nor <lb/>
Judah without Israel. Neither must Laodicea have cast off <lb/>
her wicked courses, <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> the rest of the Churches in <lb/>
Asia would have <normalised orig="joyned" auto="true">joined</normalised> in the Reformation. They, that <lb/>
dare say this, are wiser then God Almighty. For he <lb/>
calls to every one of these in particular, to repent, and <lb/>
amend within themselves, what is faulty. And though <lb/>
Timothy had failed of his duty at Ephesus, it had been <lb/>
no excuse for Titus to wink at abuses and disorders <lb/>
in Crete. Though Israel <normalised orig="transgresse" auto="true">transgress</normalised>, yet let no Judas <lb/>
<normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>.<lb/>
22. Hitherto my Propositions, as you <normalised orig="terme" auto="true">term</normalised> them; <lb/>
from whence you <normalised orig="inferre" auto="true">infer</normalised>, as a necessary consequence, <lb/>
thus; <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Then by your own saying, the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church must <lb/>
be distinct from the Church of Rome, and those in <lb/>
her communion. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
It must be so, just as a reasonable creature is distinct <lb/>
from Socrates, the species from the individuum, or particular <lb/>
person. Socrates is a reasonable creature; but not all, <lb/>
not the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> reasonable creature: every individual person <lb/>
is as much man, as much a reasonable creature, and <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> as much of man in him, as Socrates. This will be <lb/>

                  <pb n="14"/> 
                  <lb/>
the more easily discerned, if we look upon St. Paul's comparison, <lb/>
who likens the Church to a body consisting <lb/>
of many members. One member is not the body, <lb/>
nor the body one member, but many. The body receives <lb/>
not life from the members, but every member from the <lb/>
body. The body can live without the hand, or foot, or eye; <lb/>
indeed without all these: but none of these can live, when <lb/>
<normalised orig="sever'd" auto="true">severed</normalised> from the body. The <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> subsisted <lb/>
without the Church of Rome, but the Church of Rome cannot <lb/>
subsist without the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>. The Church did stand <lb/>
without Rome, before Rome was a Church. And the Church <lb/>
was visible in the time of Marcellinus, Liberius, and John 22. <lb/>
when Rome was no member thereof. Adulterari non <lb/>
potest Sponsa Christi; though Rome defile her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, the <lb/>
Spouse of Christ is not, cannot be made an Harlot. The <lb/>
tree is sound, though the leaves fall, and one or more <lb/>
branches be broken off. The fountain flows comfortably, <lb/>
though a rivulet be cut off. The reason is, because <lb/>
Christ, and no particular Church, is the fountain of <lb/>
living waters, that spring up into everlasting life. <lb/>
and they that seek to him for this water, as they ought, <lb/>
shall be sure to have it. Or, as St. Cyprian speaks, the Church <lb/>
is luce Domini perfusa, she <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> her light not from <lb/>
Rome, but from that true light, <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 1.9">which enlightens every <lb/>
man, that comes into the world.</quote> And we shall be no longer  <lb/>
the light of the world, then we are furnished with this light. <lb/>
23. So then, since you will needs have it so, the time <lb/>
was when there was a necessity for the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, not <lb/>
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> to be distinct, but divers from the Church of Rome, <lb/>
and those in her communcion; otherwise there had been no <lb/>
Church. I shall give you a satisfactory instance. When <lb/>
Liberius Bishop of Rome turned Arian, to recover liberty, <lb/>
and an <normalised orig="honorable" auto="true">honourable</normalised> <normalised orig="Bishoprick" auto="true">Bishopric</normalised>; when all Italy and Spain <lb/>
sided with him in that <normalised orig="heresie" auto="true">heresy</normalised>, when was the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> distinct <lb/>
from Rome, and those in her communion. For these (if <lb/>
we may <normalised orig="beleive" auto="true">believe</normalised> St. Austin and Tertullian) had no <lb/>
share in the Church, they were not so much as Christians, <lb/>
because <normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised>. St. Hilary of Poictieurs lamented the <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">C 2</fw>
                  <pb n="15"/> 
                  <lb/>
infamous lapse of this Bishop, professing <normalised orig="publickly" auto="true">publicly</normalised> thus, <lb/>
                  Ex eo intra nos tantum communio Dominica continentur; from <lb/>
that time forward the Lords communion is continued AMONG<lb/>
US <normalised orig="ONELY" auto="true">ONLY</normalised>. <normalised orig="Onely" auto="true">Only</normalised> us? And who are these? that he <lb/>
clears suddenly after in these words; Quidam ex vobis firmissima <lb/>

EXTRA GALLIAS ABSTINUERUNT: 
                  <lb/>
Some of you, with a most firm constancy of <lb/>
faith, containing themselves within my communion, abstained <lb/>
from others without France. Here then was no communion <lb/>
with Rome, <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> you can prove Rome to be in France; <lb/>
and yet, I hope, a <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> communion. Boast not then too <lb/>
much of the <normalised orig="Romane" auto="true">Roman</normalised> Church. Wee see in what state it <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been; and into the same state, without Gods great <lb/>
mercy, it may fall again. And when such cause is given, <lb/>
it shall be <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised> for us in like manner, to hold <lb/>
communion within our selves, in the three Britains, even <lb/>
in England <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>. And now, I think, I have <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> you <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church distinct from the Church of Rome, and <lb/>
those in her communion; such a one, as would have nothing <lb/>
to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> with Rome, while <normalised orig="Hereticall" auto="true">Heretical</normalised>. <lb/>
24. I have done with the Propositions: your desire <normalised orig="remaines" auto="true">remains</normalised>, <lb/>
which requires a large library, and a younger <lb/>
man; for your words are these; <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Wherefore I desire to be <normalised orig="shewn" auto="true">shown</normalised> the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church <lb/>
distinct from the Church of Rome, and those in her <lb/>
communion, for the last 1100 years. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
What? will no <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> serve the turn then 1100 years; <lb/>
and those together? what's the meaning of this? I never <lb/>
undertook any such thing; neither, as I know, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
this Church, or any of the Fathers thereof said any such <lb/>
thing. Our Articles acknowledge the Church of <lb/>
Rome to be a Church, and call her so. But <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised> we <lb/>
say, that those of her communion have erred, not <lb/>
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> in their living and manner of ceremonies, but also in matters <lb/>
                  <pb n="16"/> 
                  <lb/>
of faith. And this <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been prettily well proved out <lb/>
of your own men. So a Church it is, though <normalised orig="erronious" auto="true">erroneous</normalised>. <lb/>
We have never declared her to be no Church; <lb/>
neither have our Articles hitherto charged her with <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised>; <lb/>
but with fond doctrines, vainly invented, and founded <lb/>
upon no warranty of Scripture. Yea, something we blame <lb/>
you with, that is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture. <lb/>
<normalised orig="Foure" auto="true">Four</normalised> opinions of this kind my Lord of Canterbury <lb/>
<normalised orig="taxeth" auto="true">taxes</normalised> you with; viz. 1. Transubstantiation. 2. The administration of the blessed Sacrament to the Laity in one kind. <lb/>
3. Invocation of Saints: and, 4. Adoration of Images. <normalised orig="Ye" auto="true">You</normalised> <lb/>
have not hitherto quitted your selves of this <normalised orig="Inditement" auto="true">Indictment</normalised>; <lb/>
and while his book stands unconfuted, I shall <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised>, that <lb/>
<normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> are justly charged with these unsound and <normalised orig="uncatholick" auto="false">uncatholic</normalised> <lb/>
doctrines. <lb/>
25. Besides, we acknowledge, that in the visible <lb/>
Church the <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> be ever mingled with the good. That sometime <lb/>
the <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> have <normalised orig="chiefe" auto="true">chief</normalised> authority in the ministration of the <lb/>
Word and Sacraments. These we deny not to be visible <lb/>
members of the Church; but grant, that the effect of <lb/>
Christs Ordinance is not taken away by their <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised>. <lb/>
Though these be <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> in and to themselves, oft-times their <lb/>
calling does good to others, like the Scribes and Pharisees <lb/>
in Moses <normalised orig="chaire" auto="true">chair</normalised>. We are not then so forward to make <lb/>
a separation, as <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> are taught to <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised>. Indeed, hardly <lb/>
any but the Church of Rome, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been so touchy, as to <lb/>
excommunicate whole Churches upon flight occasions. <lb/>
What a stir did Bishop Victor keep about the observation <lb/>
of Easter? He excommunicated divers Churches, because they <lb/>
would not stoop to his lure. Verum ista cæteris omnibus <lb/>
parum placebant: but this was little pleasing to the rest of the <lb/>
Bishops, and among them, to that famous Bishop of Lyons, <lb/>
Ireneus. Who with divers other sharply checked and <lb/>
reproved him for it. These <normalised orig="consider'd" auto="true">considered</normalised>, that no member <lb/>
can cut off another without mischief to the whole body, <lb/>
even to it self. And the hand ought not to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> it without <lb/>
a commission from the head. For there is no Bishop of <lb/>
Bishops, as <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> conceive: neither may any one Bishop excommunicate <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">C 3</fw>
                  <pb n="17"/> 
                  <lb/>
another of his own proper authority. <lb/>
This is the work of a Synod of Bishops. Whoever does <lb/>
it of his own head, offends against the practice of the <lb/>
Church, the Canons, and Scripture it self. <lb/>
26. Thus also Bishop Steven, though otherwise a <lb/>
good man, carried himself very high, about re-baptizing <lb/>
<normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised>. Whether zeal, or that vain conceit of St. Peter's <lb/>
Chair transported him, I know not; but this I am <lb/>
sure of, he excommunicated all those, that re-baptized <lb/>
<normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised>. But what said that great Bishop of Cappadocia, <lb/>
                  Firmilianus, Tripsum excidisti, noli te fallere, mistake <lb/>
not thy self, thou Bishop of Rome; while thou goest about <lb/>
to cast out others, by this presumption thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> <lb/>
cut off thy self from the body of Christ, which is his <lb/>
Church. In those days he had no such power. How he since <lb/>
came by it, is laid open to your and every bodies eyes, by <lb/>
Archbishop Lawd, § 25. n. 12.<lb/>
27. But why for the last 1100 years? Is it because <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> <lb/>
dare not trust to the former ages? Wherein we <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> <lb/>
Zepherinus to be a Montanist, Marcellinus an Idolater, <lb/>
Liberius an Arian, and Vigilius an Eutychian. All Bishops of <lb/>
Rome, but not <normalised orig="Catholicks" auto="true">Catholics</normalised>. Needs therefore in their times <lb/>
must the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church be distinct from the Church of Rome. <lb/>
Or is it because for <normalised orig="tryall" auto="true">trial</normalised> of the truth of Religion, I appealed <lb/>
to the 500. years next after our Saviour? I <normalised orig="professe" auto="true">profess</normalised>, <lb/>
I did, and <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> so; because it is common in these <lb/>
<normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, even with those that conscientiously pretend to <lb/>
truth, not to be content with the rule of faith, <lb/>
which was once delivered to the Saints, and received <lb/>
from them by the Primitive Church, and so transmitted <lb/>
to posterity. But we have an itching after new inventions; <lb/>
and our glory it is, either to <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised>, or alter, or <lb/>
pare off something from Religion. These courses I <normalised orig="abhorre" auto="true">abhor</normalised> <lb/>
with a perfect hatred, and am taught to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> so by Tertullian, <lb/>
and Vincent. Lirinensis. Yea, some of your <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <lb/>
Bishops have resolved, that Religion admits of no <lb/>
other course but this, ut omnia, qua fide a Partibus suscepta <lb/>
forent, eadem fide filiis consigarentur; that all things be <lb/>
                  <pb n="18"/> 
                  <lb/>
preserved for the children with the same faith, wherewith <lb/>
they were received from the primitive Fathers. And <lb/>
we must not lead Religion whither we please; but rather <lb/>
we must follow whither that leads. This was the <lb/>
resolution of Stephen Bishop of Rome, an holy and prudent <lb/>
man, as Vincentius <normalised orig="termes" auto="true">terms</normalised> him. Xistus likewise <lb/>
and Celestinus are of the same <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>, they will endure <lb/>
no innovations, no additions to Antiquity. Oh, that <lb/>
Rome had always kept close to this rule; then should we <lb/>
have had no such raptures in the Church, as we now complain <lb/>
of, and <normalised orig="bewaile" auto="true">bewail</normalised>. <lb/>
28. And reason good we have to appeal to Antiquity, <lb/>
which is not <normalised orig="partiall" auto="true">partial</normalised> towards you, or us, but indifferent <lb/>
to both. She never held it meet to maintain <lb/>
the faction, or conspiracy of any one Province; <lb/>
but she stood up in <normalised orig="defense" auto="true">defence</normalised> of the whole Church, <lb/>
and not for any part thereof. And he can be no good <lb/>
Christian, that does otherwise. St. Cyprian is altogether <lb/>
for this course; if any thing be <normalised orig="amisse" auto="true">amiss</normalised>, he sends us <lb/>
to the spring head, to <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> out the fault. The like <lb/>
<normalised orig="counsell" auto="true">counsel</normalised> is given by Ireneus, If difference arise about <lb/>
any small question, <normalised orig="nonne" auto="true">nun</normalised> oporteret in antiquissimus recurere <lb/>
Ecclesias, in quibus Apostoli conversati sunt, &amp; ab iis de<lb/>
præsenti questione sumere, quod certum &amp; quod liquidum est? 
                  <lb/>
ought we not to have recourse to the most ancient Churches, <lb/>
(not to that in being) wherein the Apostles themselves conversed; <lb/>
and from those to take that which is certain and clear <lb/>
about the present question. Observe; from thence we shall <lb/>
have that, which is certain. Why then shall we content <lb/>
our selves with uncertainties? That therefore the <lb/>
third <normalised orig="Generall" auto="true">General</normalised> <normalised orig="Councell" auto="true">Council</normalised> might deal clearly, and upon sure <lb/>
grounds with Nestorius, it took this very course; holding <lb/>
it to be Catholicissimum, fælicissimum, atque optimum <lb/>
factu, most <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>, most happy, and meetest to be <lb/>
done, to take into consideration the sentences of those <lb/>
holy Fathers, that were before them. Those they took <lb/>
to be their Masters, their Counsellors, Witnesses and Judges. <lb/>
Their doctrine they held close to, their counsel they followed <lb/>
                  <pb n="19"/> 
                  <lb/>
to their testimony they gave credit, to their judgment they submitted, <lb/>
and answerably thereto passed sentence upon the difference <lb/>
then in agitation. Blame not us then, if we appeal <lb/>
to the Fathers, and by their unanimous writings <lb/>
judge of Religion, that so we may keep to the old Rules, <lb/>
and <normalised orig="avoyd" auto="true">avoid</normalised> the blasphemies of profane novelty. This was the <lb/>
proper, the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> way then known, and is now, readily <lb/>
to discern, without prejudice, presumption, or partiality, <lb/>
whether <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> or we be in the right; what is Orthodox, <lb/>
and what not. At this <normalised orig="tribunall" auto="true">tribunal</normalised> let us stand, or <lb/>
fall. <lb/>
29. All this will hardly prevail with you. For (say <lb/>
you) if this cannot be <normalised orig="shewn" auto="true">shown</normalised>, it will necessarily follow, those were <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, or else the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church was not <normalised orig="alway" auto="true">always</normalised> <lb/>
visible. <lb/>
Sir, if you can distinguish between man in specie and <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>Socr*s</sic>
                     <corr>Socrates</corr>
                  </choice>, <lb/>
you may quickly distinguish between the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> <lb/>
Church and Church of Rome. For as man is substantially <lb/>
predicated of many differing in number; so is the Church. <lb/>
Though St. Peter be a man, yet is he not the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> man; <lb/>
Judas is a man, as much as he; they both communicate <lb/>
in the same essence, in the same definition; the one is <lb/>
as much a reasonable creature as the other. And it will <lb/>
not excuse the Church of Rome from being <normalised orig="erronious" auto="true">erroneous</normalised>, because <lb/>
it is called a Church, and <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> the same definition <lb/>
with other Churches. Good and <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised>, Orthodox and <lb/>
<normalised orig="Erronious" auto="true">Erroneous</normalised> come not into the definition. The <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> definition, <lb/>
or description, of the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, that I find in <lb/>
Scripture, is this, The Church is the pillar and ground of <lb/>
truth. From whence I argue, thus; <lb/>
That Church, which <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> erred, is not the pillar and <lb/>
ground of truth. <lb/>
But the Church of Rome <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> erred: Ergo, <lb/>
The Church of Rome is not the pillar and ground of <lb/>
truth. <lb/>
The Major is <normalised orig="undenyable" auto="true">undeniable</normalised>; the Minor I prove thus: <lb/>
That Church which <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> professed Montanisme, Arianisme, <lb/>
Eutychianisme, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> erred. <lb/>
                  <pb n="20"/> 
                  <lb/>
But the Church of Rome <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> professed all these. <lb/>
Ergo, The Church of Rome <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> erred. <lb/>
The Major is clear; and the Minor is sufficiently proved, <lb/>
§18.27. It follows therefore <normalised orig="neccessarily" auto="false">necessarily</normalised>, that the Church <lb/>
of Rome, neither was, nor is the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church. And <lb/>
yet the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church was then visible, when the Church <lb/>
of Rome fell from the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> faith, and ceased to be a <lb/>
Church. Montanus, and his Enthusiasmes, were censured, <lb/>
and condemned by the Bishops of Asia, in divers <lb/>
Synods. In those <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, when Arianisme prevailed at Rome, <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church was visible at Alexandria, in <lb/>
Sardinia, in France, and other places; all which <normalised orig="adherred" auto="false">adhered</normalised> <lb/>
to the Nicene Creed. We know, that Eutyches <lb/>
was condemned at Constantinople, though his <normalised orig="heresie" auto="true">heresy</normalised> were <lb/>
received at Rome. And those heresies which were broached <lb/>
in your beloved City by John 22. were at that <lb/>
time detested in most places of <normalised orig="Christendome" auto="true">Christendom</normalised>. Thus <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church was <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> visible, when Rome it <lb/>
<normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> failed. <lb/>
30. I have done with your argument; and now, <lb/>
without offence I shall return it upon you thus. <lb/>
I desire to be <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> the body of Christ distinct <lb/>
from his hand, or <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised>. And if this cannot be <lb/>
<normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised>, it will necessarily follow, that those are the <lb/>
body of Christ; or else Christ <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> had <lb/>
a body. <lb/>
This will seem a strange Argument; and yet, what <lb/>
answer you make, the same shall I requite you with. <lb/>
For the Church is the <normalised orig="mysticall" auto="true">mystical</normalised> body of Christ. And <lb/>
his <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 12.14">body is not one member, but many.</quote> The <lb/>
whole body is not the hand; nor the hand the whole <lb/>
body. <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 12.12">For as the body is one, and <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> many members; <lb/>
and all the members of that one body, being many, are one <lb/>
body; so also is Christ.</quote> And so is his Church, into <lb/>
which we are <normalised orig="baptized" auto="true">baptised</normalised>. So then (as St. <normalised orig="Chrysostome" auto="true">Chrisostome</normalised> <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
it) Et multa unum sunt; &amp; unum est multa; these many <lb/>
are one, and this one is many; many members, and yet <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">D</fw>
                  <pb n="21"/>
                  <lb/>
but one body. As they are a body, all these are but <lb/>
one: but as every one of these are a <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> part, <lb/>
so they are different. No part alone by and of it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> <lb/>
can make a body: the best member wants the concurrence <lb/>
of the rest, even skin and <normalised orig="haire" auto="true">hair</normalised>, to make a complete <lb/>
body. In this the meanest member bears a part, and <lb/>
the best does no more. <lb/>
31. The <normalised orig="thruth" auto="false">truth</normalised> is, I may say to you, as St. Paul heretofore <lb/>
to the Corinthians; Vos estis corpus Christi, &amp; <lb/>
membra ex <normalised orig="parte" auto="true">part</normalised>, 
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 12.27"><normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> are the body of Christ, and members in <lb/>
part,</quote> or members of a member, of the Western Church, <lb/>
and <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> are no more. All Churches throughout the <lb/>
world, and yours among the rest, are members of the <lb/>
body of Christ; of that body, which is the Church <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>. <lb/>
And every one of these must <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> their parts, <lb/>
that belong unto them, that the body continue one, <lb/>
and that there be no <normalised orig="schisme" auto="true">schism</normalised> therein. For though <lb/>
St. Paul be pleased to call the Corinthians the body of <lb/>
Christ, yet as St. Chryostome observes, that Church alone <lb/>
was not the whole body; but the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> dispersed through the <lb/>
whole world. He saith therefore IN PART, or FOR <lb/>
PART; that so they may understand themselves to be but <lb/>
                  pars quædam, some part of that body, which is made up of <lb/>
all Churches. That so we may endeavour not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> to have <lb/>
peace among our selves, but with the whole Church throughout <lb/>
the earth; since we are all members of this <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> body. <lb/>
God give all of us grace to learn this lesson; and to <lb/>
remember, that the foot is no <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> a part, then the eye: <lb/>
and that neither of these alone, nor yet both in conjunction <lb/>
can make a body, but as they are <normalised orig="conjoyned" auto="true">conjoined</normalised> <lb/>
with the rest of the members. Content your selves <lb/>
then, <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> are but membra de membro, members in part, <lb/>
members of a member: <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> must be knit to the other <lb/>
parts, before <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> can grow up into a body. Indeed had <lb/>
there been no other but your selves, the Church had <lb/>
been utterly extinct, when time was, not so much as a <lb/>
sound member left. <lb/>

32. Now since you <normalised orig="presse" auto="true">press</normalised> so for the last 1100 <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised>, <lb/>
give me leave to tell you, in what state Rome was, for a <lb/>
great part of that time, you call for. From 800 <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised> <lb/>
after Christ she <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been <normalised orig="foulely" auto="true">foully</normalised> stained with all sins almost <lb/>
<normalised orig="imanigable" auto="false">imaginable</normalised>. <normalised orig="Schisme" auto="true">Schism</normalised> was raised there, and maintained <lb/>
with bribery, and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> enough, if Platina and <lb/>
Onuphrius speak right. Stella and Almain charge <lb/>
her with <normalised orig="heresie" auto="true">heresy</normalised>. And Lira <normalised orig="professeth" auto="true">professes</normalised>, that many of <lb/>
the chief therein, and the Popes themselves did apostatize from <lb/>
the faith. Five he names, 1. Zepherinus a Montanist: <lb/>
2. Marcellinus an Idolater: 3. Liberius an Arian: 4. Vigilius <lb/>
an Eutychian: and 5. Honorius a Monothelite. Genebrard tells us, of about 50 Popes, that did so degenerate <lb/>
from the virtue of their predecessors, that they <lb/>
were Apostatici potius, quam Apostolici, <normalised orig="Apostaticall" auto="true">Apostatical</normalised> rather <lb/>
then <normalised orig="Apostolicall" auto="true">Apostolical</normalised>. And yet this must be the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> <lb/>
Church. <lb/>
33. Aventinus <normalised orig="complaines" auto="true">complains</normalised>, that for 450 <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised>, the <lb/>
Popes of Rome did so trample all things under their feet, <lb/>
                  ut inferos superos in servitutem redegerint, that they brought <lb/>
heaven and hell to their beck, and made these <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>, what <lb/>
they pleased. And Petrus de Aliaco a Cardinal, that <lb/>
was present in the <normalised orig="Councel" auto="true">Council</normalised> of Constance, <normalised orig="professeth" auto="true">professes</normalised>, that <lb/>
in those <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> the Church was come to that <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised>, ut non <lb/>
sit digna regi nisi a reprobis, that it was worthy to be governed <lb/>
by none but reprobates. This he speaks of that <lb/>
Church, you <normalised orig="magnifie" auto="true">magnify</normalised> so much. Baronius <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised>, <lb/>
that there was a time, when Marozia and her daughter (a <lb/>
couple of lewd strumpets) disposed of the Popedome for <lb/>
many <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised>; so that none possessed that <normalised orig="Chaire" auto="true">Chair</normalised> but <lb/>
<normalised orig="Boyes" auto="true">Boys</normalised>, <normalised orig="Fooles" auto="true">Fools</normalised>, and Knaves: complaining that in those <lb/>
<normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, Christ lay asleep in the head of the ship. Where was <lb/>
then the holy <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church? How think you? was it <lb/>
then at Rome? <lb/>
34. Alphonsus de Castro <normalised orig="testifieth" auto="true">testifies</normalised>, that divers <normalised orig="Romane" auto="true">Roman</normalised> <lb/>
Popes were so illiterate, that they were wholly unacquainted <lb/>
with Grammar. Alvarez Pelagius gives us <lb/>
this account for his time; <normalised orig="Hodie" auto="true">Body</normalised> in Ecclesia deficit spiritus <lb/>
                     <lb/>
                     <fw type="pageNum">D 2</fw>
                     <pb n="23"/> 
                     <lb/>
prophetiae, that the spirit of <normalised orig="Prophesie" auto="true">Prophecy</normalised> did so <normalised orig="faile" auto="true">fail</normalised> the Church, <lb/>
that those words were fulfilled, 3. Reg. 22. I will <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> forth, <lb/>
and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his Prophets. <lb/>
And yet Baronius <normalised orig="professeth" auto="true">professes</normalised>, that it is plainly evident, <lb/>
that it depended upon the Popes pleasure, to enact Decrees of <lb/>
faith, and to reverse those, that were enacted. Was not here <lb/>
a Church well governed there while? Was it possible, <lb/>
such Bishops should <normalised orig="reforme" auto="true">reform</normalised> abroad, what they <lb/>
practised, and countenanced at home? In those <normalised orig="drowsie" auto="true">drowsy</normalised>, <lb/>
illiterate, and <normalised orig="Apostaticall" auto="true">Apostatical</normalised> times, John 22. broached his <lb/>
damnable heresies. And in those times, in all probability, <lb/>
were those strange doctrines hatched, and many of those <lb/>
abuses induced, we now protest against. Somewhere then <lb/>
the Church was visible, when invisible at Rome. And <lb/>
occasion is given us to presume, that in this very Island <lb/>
it was visible; since Erasmus <normalised orig="professeth" auto="true">professes</normalised>, that in all his <lb/>
travels he found learned Bishops in England <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>. And for <lb/>
many <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised>, we know, the Greek Church had small correspondence <lb/>
or communion with the <normalised orig="Latines" auto="false">Latins</normalised>; and yet <lb/>
a visible Church for all this. Neither can I doubt, but <lb/>
in other countries, even in Italy, there were some learned <lb/>
Bishops, that knew the Canons of the Church, and <lb/>
full well understood, that <normalised orig="heresie" auto="true">heresy</normalised> discharges not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <lb/>
the Bishop from his Metropolitan, but the Clark from <lb/>
subjection to his Bishop. The Church of Rome then must <lb/>
pardon us, if we withdrew our selves from her Bishops, <lb/>
when they fell into <normalised orig="Apostasie" auto="true">Apostasy</normalised>, or <normalised orig="heresie" auto="true">heresy</normalised>. And all good <lb/>
men will acquit us, for reforming abuses at home, according <lb/>
to our duty. We have good warrant for what we <lb/>
<normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>, even the authority of the whole Church representative. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Sir, I have done. If you be offended, that I have <lb/>
stirred too much in these loathsome puddles, consider, <lb/>
I beseech you, that you set me upon this unpleasing <lb/>
task. What I have done, was at your desire, and according <lb/>
                  <pb n="24"/> 
                  <lb/>
to your directions Christ knows, I have no <lb/>
private, or by end, in these my writings; it is <lb/>
your satisfaction and salvation, which I desire, and <lb/>
endeavour. God of his mercy give a blessing to these <lb/>
my labours, and to you an humble and discerning <lb/>
spirit, that you may see the truth, and embrace it: <lb/>
            So <normalised orig="prayes" auto="true">prays</normalised> <lb/></p>
