               <head>The Humble Address and Petition of Mr. George <notvariant>Seton</notvariant>, Minister of the <lb/>
Gospel for himself, and in Name of his <normalised orig="Brethreen" auto="false">Brethren</normalised> and Constituents qualified <lb/>
according to Law, and well affected to this Church.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
THE Thoughts of those Desolations and Divisions, with which <lb/>
this poor Church is harassed, are very grievous to Us, and <lb/>
to all Good Men; Because thereby the common Enemies of <lb/>
our Religion, and of Europes Peace, have their Mouths opened <lb/>
to Blaspheme. Many Thousands of Souls are become <lb/>
as Sheep without a <normalised orig="Sheepherd" auto="true">Shepherd</normalised>, Atheism and Irreligion lift up their <lb/>
heads; The Flood-gates of Wickedness are set wide open, and a <normalised orig="deludge" auto="false">deluge</normalised> of <lb/>
Sin menaces <normalised orig="Ruine" auto="true">Ruin</normalised> to a wretched Nation; a Ferment of dangerous and discontented <lb/>
Humours grows a pace, and a Fire kindled in our Bowels, is like to <lb/>
Consume us, and the Noise and Billows of our Contentions swell so high, that <lb/>
the calm Voice of Charity cannot be heard, and the sounding of her Bowels <lb/>
seems to be gone, and angry Zeal, to have usurped the place of that Wisdom <lb/>
which is from Above; That Wisdom whose endearing Character it is, to be <lb/>
Pure and Peaceable, Gentle and <normalised orig="Easie" auto="true">Easy</normalised> to be Entreated <lb/>
Yet amidst all the Pressures that deject our Minds, We count our selves <lb/>
Happy in this, That we have a King, whom GOD <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> Eminently Blessed, <lb/>
with Pity to Compassionate, and Wisdom to heal our Maladies; And that <lb/>
as a signal Instance of his Religious Care to put an end to our Lamentable <lb/>
Confusions, He <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> well and wisely Chosen Your Grace to Represent His <lb/>
own Person and Authority, in this Current Session of Parliament <lb/>
The Evils we bewail and complain of, The Animosities and Heats which <lb/>
divide Us Church-Men, and the <normalised orig="Jarrs" auto="true">Jars</normalised> which form Parties and contending Factions <lb/>
in this Kingdom, are not to be composed by the Authority of <normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised> Sanctions, <lb/>
or the imperious Language of Armed Force, or the Rude Clamours <lb/>
of the <normalised orig="unskilful" auto="false">unskillful</normalised> Multitude, or the perplexing debates of the most Learned <normalised orig="Disputants-" auto="false">Disputants</normalised> <lb/>
These have been often weighed in the <normalised orig="Ballance" auto="true">Balance</normalised> of Experience, and <lb/>
all of them found light and <normalised orig="unsufficient" auto="true">insufficient</normalised> Remedies; Charity alone can heal <lb/>
our Breaches. <lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
Were Pride and Malice, and Self-love expelled from our Breasts to make <lb/>
room for the <normalised orig="Benigne" auto="true">Benign</normalised> Inspirations of that Heavenly Grace, which <normalised orig="thinketh" auto="true">thinks</normalised> <lb/>
no Evil, which though it suffer long, yet is still kind and Complaisant, which <lb/>
<normalised orig="becometh" auto="true">becomes</normalised> all things to all Men, that by all means it may gain some, and which <lb/>
shall not fail to Flourish and Triumph, when there shall be no use either for <lb/>
Faith or Hope: Did we hearken to its soft Whispers, were our Opinions and <lb/>
our Conduct regulated by its Charming Influences. This disconsolated Church <lb/>
should put on a Gladsome Countenance, we should have Beauty for Ashes, and <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Oyle" auto="true">Oil</normalised> of Joy for Mourning, and the Garment of Praise in stead of that <lb/>
Spirit of Heaviness and Reproach, which now sits fast to us. Such Peace on <lb/>
Earth and good will amongst us Fellow Christians, and Fellow Protestants, <lb/>
would excite to new Anthems, those kind and Blessed Ministers of <lb/>
Heavens Court, who rejoice at the Conversion, though but of one Sinner. <lb/>
Then (and not till then) may we hope that Satan shall fall as Lightning <lb/>
before our feet, that Atheism and <normalised orig="Prophanity" auto="false">Profanity</normalised>, and irreligious Boldness shall <lb/>
not dare to show their Faces, but that the Gospel shall run prosperously, and <lb/>
be Glorified. <lb/>
Whereas, whilst we stand fighting for little Matters, whilst we place the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Summ" auto="true">Sum</normalised> of Religion in those things, which do not at all concern its Substance, <lb/>
whilst (Procrustes like) we will agree with none, but such as are <normalised orig="commensurat" auto="false">commensurate</normalised> <lb/>
to the Bed of our own Opinions, whilst we pay no regard to the Doctor <lb/>
of the Gentiles, his most Christian Exhortation, whereunto we have attained, <lb/>
let us be of the same mind, whilst so much shrewdness of disposition <lb/>
Reigns in us, let us Preach and Pray our very Bowels out, let us dress the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Threatnings" auto="true">Threatenings</normalised> of the Law, with the most frightful <choice ana="print-error">

all the Curses that were once pronounced on Mount Ebal, or let us study to <lb/>
allure our Hearers unto Obedience with the most liberal Promises of the <lb/>
Gospel: All the Charms and Powers of our most commending Eloquence, <lb/>
will be damped and foiled by the Blemishes of our own Lives, by the rugged <lb/>
and unchristian temper, by the Malice and Vain Glory, the Pride and partiality, <lb/>
the Bigotry and Self-Love, to which people cannot but descry <lb/>
that we are Slaves and Votaries. <lb/>
Your Grace has already by His Sacred <normalised orig="Majestie" auto="true">Majesty</normalised>’s Order recommended in <lb/>
open Parliament. Charity and Moderation, and the ending of unkindly and <lb/>
unseasonable Controversies amongst us <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>Chu*ch-Men</sic>
                     <corr>Church-Men</corr>
                  </choice>, and we have much Encouragement <lb/>
to believe, That Your Grace has therein acted a part most suitable <lb/>
to the Attractive Mildness of Your own Pious and Peaceable <normalised orig="Temper-" auto="false">Temper</normalised><lb/>
By the same Royal Order, Your Grace has owned a Power and special <lb/>
Commission, to pass such Acts as may tend effectually to curb all kinds of <lb/>
Vice and <normalised orig="Prophanity" auto="false">Profanity</normalised>; And with Joy, we behold in Your Graces Person and <lb/>
Conversation, a Noble <normalised orig="Patern" auto="true">Pattern</normalised> of Solid Virtue, a Compassionate Goodness, <lb/>
an unaffected Air of Humility, a Generous Candour, an <normalised orig="Unbyassed" auto="true">Unbiased</normalised> Mind, <lb/>
and a warm Zeal to do some signal Service both to King and Country, in the <lb/>
High Character You are now <normalised orig="Cloathed" auto="true">Clothed</normalised> with. <lb/>
When the Almighty Ruler of the World, the <normalised orig="Infinitly" auto="true">Infinitely</normalised> Wise and Just Disposer <lb/>
of all Events, thus Graciously Calls on us, and excites us to show <lb/>
our selves good Men, and good Ministers, by the Light and Authority of so <lb/>
great Examples, by Duty we owe to GOD, and to our own Souls, by the <lb/>
Dishonour Religion suffers, through our Scandalous and Uncharitable Strifes, <lb/>
by the Desolations of an once flourishing Church, by the awful sense we ought <lb/>
to have of these Spiritual Dangers, to which weak Christians are Exposed, <lb/>
whilst they see us ready to bite and devour one another, and by many other <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
concurring circumstances, if passion and prejudice keep such an Ascendent <lb/>
over us, as that the <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> of peace be still hid from our Eyes, and we will <lb/>
not hearken to sober Counsels, GOD cannot but be highly displeased with <lb/>
us, Shame and Guilt, and the tears of a future Reckoning must at once Confound <lb/>
us, the present Age will Condemn our obdurate Stiffness, and after Generations <lb/>
will Curse our reproachful Memories. <lb/>
May it please Your Grace to appoint a Conference betwixt an equal <lb/>
Number of us, and our Presbyterian <normalised orig="Brethereen" auto="false">Brethren</normalised>; And as we have <lb/>
always hitherto showed our selves Lovers of Peace and Union, upon <lb/>
Terms that in Conscience we could agree to, so we hope it shall further <lb/>
appear, that others and not we are to be blamed, if a <normalised orig="desireable" auto="true">desirable</normalised> <lb/>
Period be not put to those Schisms, which distract and divide this <lb/>
Church.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
IF Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant> had not in the Title told us that he was a Minister of the <lb/>
Gospel, the gaudy Affectation and <normalised orig="Froath" auto="true">Froth</normalised> in the Stile and Dress of his <lb/>
Paper, would never have given any Wise and Good Man ground to imagine <lb/>
it, the same looking more like the Stage and Romance, than the Form of <lb/>
sound Words, which should discover a Divine: How much <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised> he may <lb/>
fancy the Doctor of the Gentiles to favour his Design, I am sure Paul, called <lb/>
to be an Apostle of Jesus Christ, his Speech was not with <normalised orig="inticeing" auto="false">enticing</normalised> Words <lb/>
of mans Wisdom. <lb/>
If we look to the Narrative of his Petition, one might expect that we had <lb/>
got a Person so fully in Love with Charity, which he says, alone can heal <lb/>
our Breaches, as that he had a good share thereof himself, and that while others <lb/>
did not regard its calm voice, yet he himself would hearken to its <lb/>
soft whispers, but if you look to the import and Insinuations thereof, without <lb/>
any breach of the Apostle Paul’s <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>Ch*ity</sic>
                     <corr>Charity</corr>
                  </choice>, we will find neither Wisdom, <lb/>
Truth nor Charity, He may have something of Jacob's Voice, but Esau's <lb/>
Hands; for these wordy Complaints of the want of Charity, either have a <lb/>
meaning and hint at Persons and Things which are real, or else all is only <lb/>
a <normalised orig="flowrish" auto="false">flourish</normalised> of his Pen, to let the World see how passionately he would complain <lb/>
of the want of Charity, if she were a Stranger in the World, and if <lb/>
he have no other design than this last, neither Wisdom, Truth nor <normalised orig="Charitie" auto="true">Charity</normalised> <lb/>
do appear. <lb/>
But I have the charity to him, to believe his Complaints have a meaning, <lb/>
and that he thinks some People or other are so uncharitable, as that he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
sufficient Ground to open the Flood-gates of his <normalised orig="Rhetorick" auto="true">Rhetoric</normalised> against them, who <lb/>
they are he intends to wound, though he gives us an account, under the <lb/>
Envelop of such general Words, as when he shall have occasion for the same, <lb/>
may charitably extend themselves to bring in others under the Character, <lb/>
than such he <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> really design, thereby to furnish himself a Back door; yet <lb/>
its very sure the present Government both in State and Church, and those entrusted <lb/>
with the same, are the Objects of his Complaint. You may indeed <lb/>
think him sometimes <normalised orig="pritty" auto="true">pretty</normalised> square in taking in himself, and these he <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> represent, <lb/>
while he wishes Pride, Malice, and Self love expelled from our <lb/>
breasts. And you would think him very self-convict of many grievous things, <lb/>
while he says, that People cannot but descry that we are slaves and votaries <lb/>
to a rugged and unchristian Temper, to Malice and Vain glory, to pride <lb/>
and Partiality, to Bigotry and Self-love; but this is only the <normalised orig="Gentlemans" auto="true">Gentleman's</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="Complysance" auto="false">Complaisance</normalised>, you must not with an angry Zeal, be so uncharitable to think <lb/>
him, and his Constituents so full of Pride and Partiality, for the Title (that <lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
they are qualified according to Law, and well affected to this Church) <lb/>
and the Epilogue, as we have always hitherto <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> our selves lovers of <lb/>
Peace and Union, upon Terms that in Conscience we can agree to (and Charity <lb/>
will seek no other) so we hope it shall further appear, that others, and <lb/>
not We are to be blamed, if a <normalised orig="desireable" auto="true">desirable</normalised> period be not put to these Schisms, <lb/>
<normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> hold forth the Innocence of the Gentlemen, so neither he, nor any of <lb/>
his gang are the men; nor ought these of the late Episcopal Clergy, who are <lb/>
turned out for their disloyalty by the State, and censured for their Immoralities <lb/>
by the Church, be thought to be the Authors of these things he complains <lb/>
of, for its their removal which makes the desolation of an once flourishing <lb/>
Church: In a word the men who have made these desolations by <lb/>
turning out his old Brethren, are these whom he would reach, and since <lb/>
King William came to the Throne, and Presbytrie got up, there has been <lb/>
nothing but harassing this poor Church with Desolations and Divisions, and <lb/>
because Presbyterians have caused all this <normalised orig="Ruine" auto="true">Ruin</normalised> on the Church, therefore so <lb/>
peaceable a man as Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant> may expect, that at least they will allow a <lb/>
Conference, <normalised orig="seing" auto="true">seeing</normalised> he calls them his Brethren, but yet such Brethren as he <lb/>
desires no more of them than an equal number at most. <lb/>
Now, that Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant> should have in this Petition so loaded the Government, <lb/>
in Church and State, is as far from that Charity and Wisdom which he <lb/>
so recommends, as it is from that Truth, which the Character of a Minister <lb/>
should in a peculiar manner mind him of, is it Charity, by calumnious Insinuations, <lb/>
to wound a Church he pretends to be wellaffected unto, and to <lb/>
traduce those Ministers whom he calls Brethren, by representing them to be <lb/>
the Authors and Fomenters of Division and <normalised orig="Schismes" auto="false">Schisms</normalised>, and that <normalised orig="publickly" auto="true">publicly</normalised>, <lb/>
not only by a Petition to His Majesties High Commissioner, but printing <lb/>
the same to the World, when neither Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant>, nor any of his Constituents, <lb/>
since they were qualified according to Law, did ever apply to any of the Judicatories <lb/>
of this Church, or to any Minister thereof, either to be United <lb/>
themselves unto the Church, and received into the Government, to which <lb/>
they are now <normalised orig="Schismatick" auto="true">Schismatic</normalised>, or yet so much as to confer with any Presbyterian <lb/>
Minister, upon any terms of Union, or to do, or offer any thing which <lb/>
might tend, either to the propagating of the Gospel, curbing of <normalised orig="Prophanity" auto="false">Profanity</normalised>, <lb/>
or more full settling of the Church. <normalised orig="Doth" auto="true">Does</normalised> not the tendency of this Petition <lb/>
give ground to believe, that the Presbyterian Ministers are so implacable, <lb/>
that they would not all this time confer with those Episcopal Brethren, and<lb/>
that on the other hand, these charitable and peaceable Episcopal Brethren <lb/>
were following all Methods of Peace, when he says, We have always <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> <lb/>
our selves lovers of Peace and Union, I am sure no Stranger will read this Address, <lb/>
but must conclude (if all he says be good Coin) that the Presbyterians <lb/>
have been disturbers of the peace of the Church, and that all the Atheism, <lb/>
<normalised orig="Prophanity" auto="false">Profanity</normalised>. Ignorance and Irreligion, which <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> lamentably abound, is to <lb/>
be laid at their door. But though he could make this heavy Charge good, <lb/>
which he will never be able to do, yet where is this Charity in him, towards <lb/>
these his Presbyterian Brethren, to <normalised orig="insinuat" auto="false">insinuate</normalised> such shrewd things of them, <lb/>
without ever complaining to themselves, without ever (with the calm Voice <lb/>
of Charity) bespeaking and <normalised orig="intreating" auto="true">entreating</normalised> to lay aside their angry Zeal: How <lb/>
frequent <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised> Charity be in his Words, I think I do him Justice, when I <lb/>
say there is no true Charity in all his Paper, and <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*hat</sic>
                     <corr>that</corr>
                  </choice> there is more of calumnious, <lb/>
censoriousness, and shrewdness of disposition discovered by him, in <lb/>
the strain of his Discourse, than there <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> of angry Zeal been seen in the <lb/>
present Judicatories of the Church, against Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant> and his Constituents. <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
But to come more <normalised orig="closs" auto="true">close</normalised> to Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant>, How will he vindicate himself, and <lb/>
his <normalised orig="Partie" auto="true">Party</normalised>, from being the Authors and Fomenters of the Divisions of the <lb/>
Church, and also uncharitable and unjust Calumniators of the State; when <lb/>
the World knows, that Our Pious and Wise King, and the present Parliament, <lb/>
to put an end to all that Persecution, Blood-shed, <normalised orig="Barbaritie" auto="false">Barbarity</normalised>, <normalised orig="Prophanity" auto="false">Profanity</normalised>, <lb/>
Atheism and Irreligion, which did so much abound in the late <lb/>
Reigns, and was chiefly occasioned by the late Bishops and their Accomplices, <lb/>
and to stop these Flood-gates of Wickedness, which were set open <lb/>
and to prevent that <normalised orig="deludge" auto="false">deluge</normalised> of sin, which menaced <normalised orig="Ruine" auto="true">Ruin</normalised> to a then wretched <lb/>
Nation, did therefore send these Bishops and their Government a packing, <lb/>
and did settle the Church on its ancient Foundation; it having been often <lb/>
weighed in the <normalised orig="Ballance" auto="true">Balance</normalised> of Experience, that where the present Church Government <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been justly and <normalised orig="duely" auto="true">duly</normalised> Exerced, Satan <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> fallen as <lb/>
Lightning. Atheism and <normalised orig="Prophanitie" auto="false">Profanity</normalised> have not dared to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> their faces. <lb/>
Its <normalised orig="likeways" auto="true">likewise</normalised> <normalised orig="undenyably" auto="false">undeniably</normalised> true, That neither our King, Parliament, nor <lb/>
Church, did let angry Zeal so usurp the place of Wisdom, as to find all those <lb/>
who had <normalised orig="complyed" auto="true">complied</normalised> with, and submitted unto <normalised orig="Prelacy" auto="true">Prelace</normalised>, equally guilty with <lb/>
their Ring-leading Bishops; and therefore they not only did not spew them <lb/>
out with them, but to deserve the Character of Wisdom, were so gentle and <lb/>
<normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> to be entreated, as both to continue them in their Charges, and give <lb/>
them Opportunities and Invitations to be united unto, and <normalised orig="sharers" auto="false">sharers</normalised> in the Government <lb/>
of the Church; and it might have been expected, that when both <lb/>
State and Church had fixed and accorded on these terms of Communion and <lb/>
Union, that either so peaceable, charitable, and condescending Men, as <lb/>
Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant> and his Brethren would have come in to the Church on these <lb/>
Terms, or at least been quiet without complaining. <lb/>
Many in the World, and even the greatest (and I am sure the best) Bishops <lb/>
in England thought these Terms <normalised orig="setled" auto="true">settled</normalised> by the King, Parliament and <lb/>
Assembly, so Christian, just, rational and condescending on the Government <lb/>
and Churches part, as might have satisfied all true Lovers of Peace and <lb/>
Religion, and such as <normalised orig="consciencious" auto="true">conscientious</normalised> Men might accept of and thereby in <lb/>
some measure put an end to the Divisions of the Church: yet peaceable Mr, <lb/>
<notvariant>Seton</notvariant> and his Constituents, will not only despise and neglect these Means of the <lb/>
Churches peace, but will still complain that others kindle and keep up the Fire, <lb/>
But farther our King did with Pity compassionate, those whom his Wisdom <lb/>
could not heal of their Maladies, and found out a way how these who had neglected <lb/>
to render themselves useful to the Church should not be altogether Ruined <lb/>
themselves, unless they did it with their own hands, and therefore <normalised orig="makeeth" auto="false">makes</normalised> <lb/>
a Charitable offer unto them, that who ever like Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant>, and his <lb/>
Constituents would own the Government of the state should enjoy in the <lb/>
Church the Charges they <normalised orig="possest" auto="true">possessed</normalised>, tho they did neglect to capacitate themselves <lb/>
to be sharers in the Government of the <normalised orig="same-" auto="false">same</normalised> <lb/>
The Church Judicatories likewise have <normalised orig="exerced" auto="false">exerted</normalised> that temper in their procedures, <lb/>
as to give many demonstrations of a readiness in them, to have as many <lb/>
of these who had submitted to <normalised orig="Prelacy" auto="true">Prelace</normalised> <normalised orig="keeped" auto="true">kept</normalised> useful as they could find to be <lb/>
Men of Probity, <normalised orig="Sinceritie" auto="true">Sincerity</normalised> and Worth; and after all this for Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant> to raise <lb/>
this Clamour and Dust, <normalised orig="argueth" auto="true">argues</normalised> neither Charity nor Probity. <lb/>
I will not call it Irreligious Boldness, but Impudent and Imprudent <lb/>
It is for Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant> to make this Clutter, who himself was personally desired <lb/>
and invited to unite with the Church by the Committee of the General Assembly <lb/>
for the North, anno 1694. and both refused these Terms, which the <lb/>
Law, and the Church  required, and <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> and <normalised orig="combind" auto="false">combined</normalised> with others in that <lb/>
Illegal Protestation against and Declinature of the Authority of that Judicatory, <lb/>

                  <lb/>
settled by the Law and Authority of that same King, whom he would make <lb/>
us believe he thinks himself happy in having, and which Protestation Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant> <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> <lb/>
was by the same Parliament, after a full hearing, found to be seditious, unpeaceable <lb/>
and illegal; and for which, some of Mr. Seton's fellow. Protestators were justly <lb/>
censured by it. And for Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant>, conscious of his own guilt, to address his Majesties <lb/>
High Commissioner this same Parliament sitting, in such a strain as <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> reflect <lb/>
upon both Church and State, Is such a piece of Charity and Wisdom, as some <lb/>
desire not to imitate. <lb/>
But what is the Conclusion Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant> <normalised orig="draweth" auto="true">draws</normalised>, after he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> given the Government <lb/>
and Church so many indirect Thrusts, he humbly desires his Grace, to appoint a <lb/>
Conference betwixt an equal number of us and our Presbyterian <normalised orig="Brethreen" auto="false">Brethren</normalised>. Now any man <lb/>
would think the honest man is indeed in earnest for a Conference, and for what end, even <lb/>
to put a <normalised orig="desireable" auto="true">desirable</normalised> Period to these Schisms, which distract and divide this Church: <lb/>
and no doubt, he is for the immediate ending of unkindly, and unseasonable Controversies <lb/>
amongst <normalised orig="Vs" auto="true">Us</normalised> Church men, and His Grace to be the Umpire. <lb/>
If I had not heard of a Protestation drawn, and ready to be presented in March <lb/>
1691, to the Commission of the Church, which was to have met at Aberdeen at that <lb/>
time, (had it not been impeded by some charitable and peaceable Men) wherein <lb/>
they declare that their Consciences scrupled to <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> Presbyterian Government, and <lb/>
particularly Lay-elders, as they are pleased to call them, and that Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant>, and <lb/>
some of his Constituents were of that Number, and that he, and the same gang, <lb/>
did solemnly Address the General Assembly in January 1692, and then acknowledge <lb/>
that Assembly, consisting of the same Presbyterian Ministers and Lay-elders, to be <lb/>
a lawful Assembly, and lawful Government, and offered to join and concur therewith <lb/>
as such, without any scruple of Conscience; and that constant and conscientious <lb/>
Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant>, was with the rump of his Party, one of fourteen who delivered <lb/>
in the same Protestation, drawn 1691, to the <normalised orig="Committe" auto="true">Commit</normalised> of the General Assembly <lb/>
for the North at Aberdeen, in anno 1694, as if it had been fresh and new, wherein, <lb/>
Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant> and the rest have the old scruples at the Government, and cannot in Conscience <lb/>
comply with their 1692 years Consciences: <choice ana="illegible">

to have heard these things of him, and such an uncharitable Memory as to remember <lb/>
them, I might have been more ready to believe Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant> in earnest. Before <lb/>
I hearken to the soft Whispers of Charity towards him, and be convinced of <lb/>
his sincerity, it will be necessary to satisfy my Reason of these doubts; I doubt he <lb/>
designs a Conference, thereby to put a Period to these Schisms in the Church; when <lb/>
he <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> very well, that none of the Presbyterian <normalised orig="Brethreen" auto="false">Brethren</normalised> can confer with him <lb/>
in name of the Church, and as thereto authorized by the Government thereof: He  <lb/>
is not ignorant that a General Assembly only can delegate such a Power, as to confer <lb/>
in the Name of the Church; and to confer as private Persons will never end the <lb/>
Controversies, so I demur that his design is any Conference at all: and how discreet <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> he been to his Grace, let the World judge, for if these Conferrees are to confer <lb/>
with a <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Character, he desires of his Grace a thing impossible for him to grant, <lb/>
and therefore impertinent to be fought. If there be only two or three Presbyterian <lb/>
Brethren desired to discourse of Church-affairs, as private Persons, with Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant> <lb/>
and his equal number, His Grace's being taken up with the weighty Affairs of the <lb/>
King and Parliament, might have pleaded with Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant>, not to give him the <lb/>
trouble to do that which would at all time be an unsuitably mean employ for him, <lb/>
and which might with more ease and charity on Mr. Seton's part been fought of his <lb/>
Presbyterian <normalised orig="Brethreen" auto="false">Brethren</normalised>, who, had he asked the same of them, would not have refused <lb/>
him; none of them yet have, and I am confident of many of them at least, <lb/>
never shall: But Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant>, it may be <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> think, he and his Constituents will have <lb/>
greater Advantage, by making a braving offer of a Conference, which he <normalised orig="concludeth" auto="true">concludes</normalised> <lb/>
will not be granted him, by the thing it self. It's somewhere else than either <lb/>
with his Grace, or the Honourable Estates of Parliament, that he expects his Petition <lb/>
will have charming Influences; he hopes the Charms and Powers of his most commanding <lb/>
Eloquence will take, where a just and true Representation of the Practices and temper <lb/>
of his <normalised orig="Partie" auto="true">Party</normalised>, will not be so diligently communicate, and ushered in with such <lb/>
Pomp and Fast of Words. <lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
I doubt Mr. Seton's design, when he so unequally demands a Conference <normalised orig="betwix" auto="true">betwixt</normalised> <lb/>
an equal number of us and our Presbyterian <normalised orig="Brethreen" auto="false">Brethren</normalised>, <normalised orig="seing" auto="true">seeing</normalised> the Government of the <lb/>
Church is settled in the Hands of Presbyterian <normalised orig="Brethreen" auto="false">Brethren</normalised> by Law, and they in a fixed <lb/>
Possession of the same, and acting therein with that success, as is the envy of <lb/>
Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant>, and his Constituents; and such as with the blessing of God, will in a <lb/>
final time fill these Vacancies. which the <normalised orig="disloyaltie" auto="true">disloyalty</normalised> and <normalised orig="prophanity" auto="false">profanity</normalised> of these who <lb/>
were Mr. Seton's old Friends and Allays have made in his <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised>, with men, I hope <lb/>

laid down another way of Application, than the demand of a Conference of an equal <lb/>
number, as if his gang and the Church were on equal Terms; But he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> in some <lb/>
measure gained his Point, if he make some in another <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised> believe that the Episcopal <lb/>
Party are still so considerable in Scotland, as that notwithstanding the Government <lb/>
of the Church, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> for several years been settled in the hands of Presbyterians, <lb/>
and been countenanced and cherished by the State, yet they think it their <lb/>
due (due to their greater numbers, better cause and most commanding Eloquence) to <lb/>
demand of a High Commissioner (and in the view of a Parliament, who <lb/>
have so much Favoured <normalised orig="Presbytrie" auto="false">Presbytry</normalised>) such a Conference; He <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> that in <lb/>
this <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised> it will not take, The Parliament and Church have determined concerning <lb/>
the goodness of his cause, and he speaks sad truth, when he says, their commanding <lb/>
Eloquence will be damped and <normalised orig="foild" auto="false">foiled</normalised> by the Blemishes of their own lives; and when <lb/>
the Numbers of his Constituents shall be enquired into, he cannot let see so many <lb/>
<normalised orig="Duzons" auto="false">Dozens</normalised> of them qualified according to Law, even with the Civil part of Qualifications, <lb/>
as there are Hundreds of his Presbyterian <normalised orig="Brethereen" auto="false">Brethren</normalised>; And some of his Constituents <lb/>

Anthems the change of the present Government; the Re-establishing of Bishops and <lb/>

That every Man and every Minister might have the Liberty to follow their own Inclination, <lb/>

so great a Blessing, and Mr. Seaton would be so Charitable (at least for this Session of <lb/>
Parliament) as to allow some Angry zealous Bigots a gentle touch of Presbytry, providing <lb/>
it offended no body, and then when every body got their will, all would be pleased; <lb/>
But I am of the opinion, more peace, then that would produce, may be had at <lb/>

                  <lb/>
Mr. <notvariant>Seton</notvariant> will be in such a strait to get his Charity to his own Constituents on the <lb/>
one hand, so largely extended as to secure them, be their Immoralities what they will <lb/>
from the <normalised orig="cloutches" auto="false">clutches</normalised> of angry Zeal, and his <normalised orig="Complisance" auto="true">Complaisance</normalised> on the other hand is such, as not <lb/>

sent it up last Post to London, he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> waited as long as he thought fit, and <lb/>

But before he go, I would let him and his gang see, that all Presbyterians are not <lb/>

would charitably advise him and his Friends to lay aside their Illegal as well as Unchristian <lb/>
combinations to Re-establish Episcopacy in Scotland, which Tyranny now <lb/>

strive and endeavour in Preaching of the Gospel to come to their Flock, in the demonstration <lb/>
