WHat's the best<lb/>
News abroad?<lb/>
So we must begin:<lb/>
<normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> the<lb/>
Garb (<normalised orig="les" auto="true">less</normalised> novelles)<lb/>
the grand salute, and<lb/>
common Preface to all our<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="2">B</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
talk. And the news goes not<lb/>
as things are in themselves,<lb/>
but as <normalised orig="mensfancies" auto="false">mens fancies</normalised> are fashioned,<lb/>
as some lust to report,<lb/>
and others to believe:<lb/>
The same relation shall <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised><lb/>
for true or false, according to<lb/>
the key wherein <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> minds<lb/>
are tuned; but chiefly as<lb/>
they stand diverse in Religion,<lb/>
so they feign and affect<lb/>
different News. By their<lb/>
News <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> may know their<lb/>
Religion, and by their Religion<lb/>
fore-know their News.<lb/>
This week the Spanish Match<lb/>
goes forward and Bethleem<lb/>
Gabors <normalised orig="Troups" auto="true">Troops</normalised> are broken;<lb/>
and the next week Bethleem<lb/>
Gabors <normalised orig="Troups" auto="true">Troops</normalised> <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> forward,<lb/>
and the Spanish Match is broken.<lb/>
The <normalised orig="Catholique" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> is of the<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="3">2</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
Spanish match, and the Protestant<lb/>
of restoring the Palatinate; <lb/>
and each party think<lb/>
that the safety of the Church<lb/>
and success of religion depends<lb/>
upon the event of one<lb/>
or other, and therefore they<lb/>
cross and counter-tell each<lb/>
others news. Titius came<lb/>
from London yesterday, and<lb/>
he <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> that the new <normalised orig="Chappel" auto="true">Chapel</normalised><lb/>
at St. James is quite finished:<lb/>
Caius came thence<lb/>
but this morning, and then<lb/>
there was no such thing on<lb/>
building. False news follows<lb/>
true at the heels, and oftentimes<lb/>
outstrips it.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Thus goes the <normalised orig="Chroniclenews" auto="false">Chronicle news</normalised>,<lb/>
the <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> of the factius<lb/>
and <normalised orig="pragmatick" auto="true">pragmatic</normalised>; but the<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="4">B 2</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
Christian news, the <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> of<lb/>
the faithful is spent in Euangelio,<lb/>
in hearing and telling<lb/>
some good news of their<lb/>
Saviour: and now all the<lb/>
talk is of his Resurrection.<lb/>
The Christian current goes,<lb/>
News from Mount Calvary,<lb/>
the sixteenth day of Nisan,<lb/>
in the year thirty four, old<lb/>
style; as the three holy Matrons<lb/>
deliver it at the eighth<lb/>
verse of this Chapter. But<lb/>
since there are certain <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised><lb/>
arrived, and they say<lb/>
there was no such matter as<lb/>
the Resurrection, <normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> but<lb/>
a gull put upon the world<lb/>
by his Disciples; for it fares<lb/>
with spiritual news as with<lb/>
temporal, it is variuosly and<lb/>
contrarily related, till the <lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
false controls the true. And<lb/>
as our modern News comes<lb/>
neither from the Court nor<lb/>
the Camp, nor from the<lb/>
place where things are acted,<lb/>
but is forged in Conventicles<lb/>
by Priests, or in<lb/>
some <normalised orig="Pauls" auto="true">Paul's</normalised> Assembly, or such<lb/>
like place; and the divulge<lb/>
committed to some vigilant<lb/>
and watchful tongue: So it<lb/>
is with the News of the Nonresurrection; <lb/>
it came not<lb/>
from Mount Calvary, but<lb/>
the Priests are the Authors of<lb/>
it, at the eleventh verse; and<lb/>
at the twelveth, they frame<lb/>
and mould it to the mouth<lb/>
of the Watch. The Divulgers,<lb/>
men of double credit,<lb/>
they know the truth, for they<lb/>
are of the Watch, and they<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="6">B 3</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
will not <normalised orig="lye" auto="true">lie</normalised>, for they are<lb/>
<normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised>; nay, they will<lb/>
maintain it, for they are<lb/>
Knights, Milites, Knights of<lb/>
the Post, they are hired to<lb/>
say, saying, and they did<lb/>
say, His Disciples came by<lb/>
night and stole him away<lb/>
whilst we slept.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
The words so plain, they<lb/>
need no opening. May it<lb/>
please you that I make three<lb/>
Cursories over them; One<lb/>
for the <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised>, another for<lb/>
the Disciples, and the third<lb/>
for our Saviour. In the two <lb/>
former we will beat the<lb/>
point pro and con, and in the<lb/>
latter reconcile it, for that's<lb/>
the fashion also. No error so<lb/>
absurd but finds a Patron,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="7">6</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
nor Truth so sound but<lb/>
meets with an Adversary,<lb/>
nor point controverted<lb/>
but the opposite tenent may<lb/>
be reconciled; be they distant<lb/>
as Heaven and Hell, as<lb/>
incompatible as Jew and<lb/>
Christian, yet they shall<lb/>
meet with a Moderator, and<lb/>
a cogging distinction shall<lb/>
state the question on the absurder<lb/>
side. First then for <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised>, whose Cursory<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> no parts, that's not the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised> manner, but yet is<lb/>
sprinkled with absurdities,<lb/>
that's the manner of the <lb/>
Watch. They speak partly <lb/>
as they fight, voluntarily,<lb/>
and partly as they watch,<lb/>
supinely. And thus they<lb/>
begin their talk:<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="8">B 4</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="Ye" auto="true">You</normalised> men and people of<lb/>
Judah and Jerusalem, This<lb/>
Jesus of Nazareth was a very<lb/>
<normalised orig="Jugler" auto="true">Juggler</normalised>, a neat Compiler<lb/>
of Impostures, pretended title<lb/>
to the crown of Judah, made<lb/>
himself the Messias and the<lb/>
Son of God, brought such<lb/>
strange opinions as would<lb/>
turn the whole world out of<lb/>
bias; having no proof from<lb/>
sense or reason for his Novelties,<lb/>
he would needs<lb/>
confirm them by miracles;<lb/>
and in the worlds eye he seemed<lb/>
to do wonders, though<lb/>
his works were indeed but<lb/>
<normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> delusions, wrought by<lb/>
flight of hand, hocus pocus.<lb/>
All which was so manifestly <lb/>
discovered, that to stop the<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="9">8</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
current of such false coin,<lb/>
my Lord President was forced <lb/>
to nail him to the <normalised orig="Crosse" auto="true">Cross</normalised><lb/>
for a Counterfeit. His Master-trick<lb/>
was that of the Resurrection,<lb/>
whereof he forespake<lb/>
in his life-time: for<lb/>
he was no ordinary dealer,<lb/>
but would make his Cunning<lb/>
to survive his person,<lb/>
and durst fore-say so. To<lb/>
put this piece in Execution,<lb/>
he entertained a rabble of<lb/>
Ruffians, whom he termed<lb/>
his Disciples, as all Plotters<lb/>
have Partners: These he<lb/>
instructed in the game while<lb/>
he lived, and they were to<lb/>
play it when he was dead.<lb/>
The list of his Disciples consisted<lb/>
of Men and Women;<lb/>
for in all crafty carriages<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="10">B 5</fw>

                  <lb/>
there <normalised orig="lyes" auto="true">lies</normalised> a Womans part.<lb/>
The men were to perfom<lb/>
all manner of fact, and the<lb/>
women, whose activity lies in<lb/>
their tongue, were to report<lb/>
the miracle.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
The High-priests and some<lb/>
of the Sanedrim being wise<lb/>
to apprehend, and wary to<lb/>
prevent the dangerous consequences<lb/>
hereof, procured<lb/>
a warrant from the President<lb/>
to seal up the Tomb, and<lb/>
place a Watch there; and we<lb/>
were the parties appointed<lb/>
to guard it. The Charge<lb/>
we underwent required good<lb/>
service, for his Disciples<lb/>
were common Night-walkers<lb/>
like their Master, notable<lb/>
Cutters, and carried as<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="11">10</fw>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
much courage as cunning;<lb/>
such tall fellows with their<lb/>
weapons, that they made it<lb/>
but a <normalised orig="sleight" auto="true">slight</normalised> either to withstand<lb/>
or assault a whole multitude,<lb/>
and durst do any<lb/>
thing in their Masters behalf.<lb/>
The other night,<lb/>
when we apprehended him<lb/>
in Gethsemane, we were most<lb/>
of the lustiest fellows in Jerusalem,<lb/>
and pretty well appointed,<lb/>
yet they stood to it<lb/>
stoutly, made a tall fray, and<lb/>
sometimes put us to the<lb/>
worst: At the first On-Set we<lb/>
were all <normalised orig="knock'd" auto="true">knocked</normalised> down, and<lb/>
at our Recovery, Rabbi Malchrus,<lb/>
a follower of the Highpriests<lb/>
company and our<lb/>
Captain, was singled out by<lb/>
one of their side, a <normalised orig="Sayler" auto="true">Sailor</normalised> he<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="12">11</fw>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
seemed, who with his <normalised orig="whinyard" auto="false">vineyard</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="lopt" auto="true">lopped</normalised> off one of his ears,<lb/>
and had the blow light<lb/>
right, it would have cleft<lb/>
him down to the twist. Nay<lb/>
they were all Bravers, and<lb/>
their bloody mind was seen<lb/>
upon Judas Iscariot, one of <lb/>
their own company, who<lb/>
because he was our Bloodhound<lb/>
to sent their Master<lb/>
out, they persecuted the<lb/>
poor wretch till they had<lb/>
<normalised orig="paunch'd" auto="false">paunched</normalised> him; for not far<lb/>
from their walk he was<lb/>
found <normalised orig="hang'd" auto="true">hanged</normalised> with his guts<lb/>
about his heels. And for<lb/>
their bloody pranks that<lb/>
way, the place begins to <lb/>
bear the name of Aceldama,<lb/>
the bloody field. <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="13">12</fw>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
For the exploit of his resurrection,<lb/>
they had the assistance<lb/>
of their fellow-she-disciples,<lb/>
night house-wives<lb/>
too, for they were hovering<lb/>
about the Sepulchre from<lb/>
the dead of the night till the<lb/>
morning, and were as the<lb/>
Counter-watch to give notice<lb/>
of some advantage to the<lb/>
Disciples, who lay not far off,<lb/>
some where above ground,<lb/>
while their master was under<lb/>
it. All the day-time<lb/>
they stir not for fear of Passengers,<lb/>
frequenting to and<lb/>
fro in the gardens and walks<lb/>
about Mount Calvary; it being<lb/>
both Sabbath and <normalised orig="Passeover" auto="true">Passover</normalised>;<lb/>
but in the night they<lb/>
took their opportunity by<lb/>
this means: We had been<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="14">13</fw>
                  <pb n="14"/>

<normalised orig="extreamly" auto="true">extremely</normalised> <normalised orig="over-travell'd" auto="false">over-travelled</normalised>,<lb/>
both to apprehend and guard<lb/>
him, first, to the Highpriest,<lb/>
next to the President;<lb/>
from him to Herod, and back<lb/>
again; then to his arraignment,<lb/>
then to his Execution<lb/>
and ever since at his grave; <lb/>
so turbulent the man was,<lb/>
that his very dead body<lb/>
would not <normalised orig="lye" auto="true">lie</normalised> still and be<lb/>
quiet. This over-watching,<lb/>
seconded with the darkness<lb/>
of the night, and <normalised orig="coldnesse" auto="true">coldness</normalised> of<lb/>
the <normalised orig="ayre" auto="true">air</normalised>, cast us into a heavy <lb/>
sleep; thereupon the women<lb/>
give the watch-word to the<lb/>
Disciples, who immediately<lb/>
do exhumate his body; and<lb/>
while they translate and<lb/>
bury it elsewhere, the women<lb/>
trot into the Town, and<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="15">14</fw>
                  <pb n="15"/>

<normalised orig="bruit" auto="true">brute</normalised> it abroad that their <lb/>
Master is risen.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
And the credulous City<lb/>
is partly inclined to believe<lb/>
the Legerdemain; they are<lb/>
willing to frame their faith<lb/>
and build their salvation upon<lb/>
a flying gull, raised by<lb/>
three way-going women,<lb/>
gadling Gossips that came<lb/>
from Galilee; One of them notorious,<lb/>
so <normalised orig="divellish" auto="false">devilish</normalised> that there<lb/>
came seven <normalised orig="divells" auto="true">devils</normalised> out of<lb/>
her, how many staid behind<lb/>
God knows; it is like she was<lb/>
so full, there was room for<lb/>
no more; and by her <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised><lb/>
may guess at her companions.<lb/>
Consider of it; the<lb/>
matter is of moment, a<lb/>
main point of State, that<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="16">15</fw>

We are but strangers, and<lb/>

it; and therefore be advised<lb/>
whether <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> will rely herein<lb/>
upon the word of a woman,<lb/>
or upon the faith and reputation<lb/>
of a <normalised orig="Souldier" auto="true">Soldier</normalised>. And<lb/>
here the <normalised orig="Souldier" auto="true">Soldier</normalised> puts up,<lb/>
he sheaths his malicious and<lb/>
blasphemous tongue, more<lb/>
sharp and deadly then his<lb/>
sword, and gives our Saviour <lb/>
a wound more mortal<lb/>
far then those upon the<lb/>
Cross; they did but put him<lb/>
in a trance, suspend his life<lb/>
for a day or two, at the most<lb/>
but kill his Humanity; but<lb/>
this would <normalised orig="murther" auto="true">murder</normalised> his Divinity,<lb/>

arguments, sufficient<lb/>
to convey belief into a<lb/>

the first then, His Disciples<lb/>
came not by night.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
The body moves not voluntarily,<lb/>
unless the motion<lb/>
be grounded upon the Will;<lb/>
                  <pb n="21"/>
                  <lb/>
so that when the influence<lb/>
of the Will upon the external<lb/>
members is either intercepted<lb/>
or frustrated by any<lb/>
<normalised orig="forreign" auto="true">foreign</normalised> accident, the body<lb/>
hardly admits of going and<lb/>
<normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised>. The heart, and<lb/>
first mover of the Disciples,<lb/>
was now mated and set up<lb/>
by a Lease of impetuous<lb/>
passions. All those Violents<lb/>
of the Soul which have<lb/>
mischiefs for their Objects,<lb/>
and are immediately distractive<lb/>
to the Patient that endures<lb/>
them, as sorrow, fear<lb/>
and despair, did now wholly<lb/>
possess them: Extreme sorrow<lb/>
for their Masters present<lb/>
sufferings, as much fear for<lb/>
their own future danger, and<lb/>
their like <normalised orig="despaire" auto="true">despair</normalised> for their<lb/>

fore-hoped <normalised orig="happinesse" auto="true">happiness</normalised>. Their<lb/>
senses feel the sorrow, their<lb/>
fear torments their fancies,<lb/>
and their memory maintains<lb/>
their despair; their whole<lb/>
soul so assaulted, that there<lb/>
wanted nothing but a Fever<lb/>
to make them quite <normalised orig="frantick" auto="true">frantic</normalised>. <lb/>
And Peter came <normalised orig="neer" auto="true">near</normalised> <lb/>
to that, so distracted, that<lb/>
for his Masters sake first he<lb/>
will needs fight, then he <normalised orig="flyes" auto="true">flies</normalised><lb/>
away; anon again he follows<lb/>
after him, at length he forswears<lb/>
him, and in the end<lb/>
goes out and cries. In this<lb/>
mode he is carried up and<lb/>
down, till he <normalised orig="layes" auto="true">lays</normalised> a clog on<lb/>
his conscience, that would<lb/>
hold him work enough<lb/>
without coming to Mount<lb/>
Calvary. The case of his<lb/>

Thus far they go all with<lb/>
Peter, that they sleep, and<lb/>
<normalised orig="flye" auto="true">fly</normalised>, and follow afar off.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
But when their Master<lb/>
was past all recovery, then<lb/>
each passion plaid his part to<lb/>
hinder all humour from<lb/>
<normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> to Mount Calvary.<lb/>
Their sorrow contracts, and<lb/>
<normalised orig="closeth" auto="true">closes</normalised> them up in Jerusalem:<lb/>
Sorrow loves to be private<lb/>
and lurk in a corner.<lb/>
Fear kept them within<lb/>
doors: Fear dare not go abroad,<lb/>
especially in the<lb/>
night, if she do, it is to <normalised orig="flie" auto="true">fly</normalised> a<lb/>
danger, not to invite it. And<lb/>
to Despair all business must<lb/>

in her own behalf, unless to<lb/>
do her self a mischief, but<lb/>
of any other she is quite<lb/>
careless. To say then they<lb/>
came by night, makes it but<lb/>
the more unlikely. They<lb/>
could not watch one hour<lb/>
with him in Gethsemane when<lb/>
it concerned his life, while<lb/>
there was yet hope to vindicate<lb/>
him from the Cross;<lb/>
and can they now watch<lb/>
with him a whole night<lb/>
when he was dead and buried? <lb/>
If they were for a nights<lb/>

done it the night <choice ana="print-error">

and greater security. <lb/>
They now had no<lb/>

for poor Fishermen to make<lb/>

night, to affront the Roman<lb/>

if their Master could rise again,<lb/>
what need they come<lb/>
hither? if not, they did him<lb/>
no wrong to abandon him.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
But why mention we the <lb/>
Resurrection? they came<lb/>
not thither, not to a thought<lb/>
of it. He had indeed foretold<lb/>
                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>
them of it, but they understood<lb/>
it not: they could<lb/>
not prosecute what they<lb/>
never apprehended; could<lb/>
they hope to make others<lb/>
believe what they could<lb/>
not imagine? Could others<lb/>
grant that fearable, which<lb/>
they esteemed impossible?<lb/>
or had they once belief, yet<lb/>
they forsook it when they<lb/>
forsook their Master. They<lb/>
were beaten from it in Gethsemane,<lb/>
where but one of the<lb/>
Jews received any <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised>, and<lb/>
he but of one of his <normalised orig="eares" auto="true">ears</normalised>,<lb/>
and that restored again; but<lb/>
they all lost every one his<lb/>
faith, they lost their Saviour,<lb/>
and their Souls to boot.<lb/>
They were now as faithless<lb/>
as their fellow Judas, as<lb/>

                  <lb/>
faithless in their Master as<lb/>
he was to him. The Resurrection<lb/>
quite forgot, not<lb/>
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> the thing it self, but<lb/>
their Masters mention of it:<lb/>
and therefore they embalm<lb/>
his dead body, and do <normalised orig="entombe" auto="true">entomb</normalised> <lb/>
it as forlorn. The<lb/>
Priests themselves believed<lb/>
more then the Disciples:<lb/>
they feared it, and therefore<lb/>
fortified the <normalised orig="Sepulcher" auto="true">Sepulchre</normalised>; but<lb/>
the Disciples did not so<lb/>
much as hope. And when<lb/>
he was risen de facto, they<lb/>
could not believe it, though<lb/>
the women avouched it:<lb/>

and spread the fame; but<lb/>
they stood mute at it, and<lb/>
began to spread themselves<lb/>
each man what way his fancy<lb/>
led him: the fame of the<lb/>
Resurrection did not fright<lb/>
them. And how came the<lb/>

to the high Priests? not his<lb/>

But why stand we<lb/>

the Priests, and much in use<lb/>
at this day, saving that now<lb/>
they practise it one upon the<lb/>
other, and so let them; good<lb/>
speed may they have.<lb/>
But for all this they might<lb/>
be asleep, whether our Saviour<lb/>
were stole away or no. <lb/>
Somewhat the begging <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised><lb/>
would have, &amp; they <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised>,<lb/>

an article of our Creed,<lb/>
the very groundsel of all our<lb/>
Faith: his Resurrection the<lb/>
pattern &amp; pledge of ours, the<lb/>
tenure where by we hold our<lb/>
title to salvation. But for<lb/>
their being asleep we <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> not<lb/>
much contend; it is credible<lb/>
                  <pb n="45"/>
                  <lb/>
they were so, the contrary<lb/>
being neither implied, nor<lb/>
expressed in the Scripture.<lb/>
But yet their sleep is no<lb/>
proof of their saying. They<lb/>
know the things were done<lb/>
just as they say, for they were<lb/>
asleep the while. A right Roman<lb/>
reason, a proof put from <lb/>
a Priest to serve a sleepy<lb/>
<normalised orig="Souldier" auto="true">Soldier</normalised>. If they were asleep,<lb/>
how could they say he was<lb/>
<normalised orig="stollen" auto="true">stolen</normalised> rather then risen? or<lb/>
if they suppose him <normalised orig="stollen" auto="true">stolen</normalised>,<lb/>
how knew they his Disciples<lb/>
did it rather then other men?<lb/>
This must needs argue in<lb/>
them either calumny to accuse<lb/>
a party without cause, or<lb/>
levity to lay the cause upon a<lb/>
wrong party; either way folly <lb/>
to <normalised orig="alledg" auto="false">allege</normalised> so <normalised orig="senseles" auto="true">senseless</normalised> a reason. <lb/>

                  <pb n="46"/>
                  <lb/>
All our knowledge is either<lb/>
from Sense, or Reason; from<lb/>
Reason they could not have<lb/>
it, that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> made against<lb/>
them all this while; from<lb/>
any sense they could not, for<lb/>
they were asleep, in sleep all<lb/>
sensation is intercepted.<lb/>
They could neither hear,<lb/>
see, smell, taste nor feel<lb/>
the Disciples coming, or his<lb/>
stealing; if they did, they<lb/>
were not asleep. If some<lb/>
one were awake, and perceived<lb/>
it, why did he not<lb/>
give an <normalised orig="Alarum" auto="true">Alarm</normalised> to the rest?<lb/>
if they understood it afterwards<lb/>
from others, why do<lb/>
they not produce <normalised orig="authentick" auto="true">authentic</normalised><lb/>
witnesses? If the Disciples<lb/>
themselves confessed it,<lb/>
why were they not punished,<lb/>

                  <lb/>
and order taken to stop the<lb/>
rumour of the Resurrection?<lb/>
There is no way now left,<lb/>
but to pretend the Spirit, as<lb/>
our Enthusiasts do, and to<lb/>
say, that while they slept<lb/>
they had it in a dream by revelation.<lb/>
But that is refuted<lb/>
by retortion of the<lb/>
same, for by revelation every<lb/>
Christian <normalised orig="knowes" auto="true">knows</normalised> the contrary;<lb/>
God reveals it unto<lb/>
him.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
But why do the <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised><lb/>
produce this reason? the <lb/>
reason is, they took it upon<lb/>
trust from the Priests. It is<lb/>
an old <normalised orig="errour" auto="true">error</normalised> (let us not<lb/>
contend for the age) to believe<lb/>
that the Priest cannot<lb/>
<normalised orig="erre" auto="true">err</normalised>. But why are the <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised><lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="48">47</fw>
                  <pb n="48"/>
                  <lb/>
got thus to argue against<lb/>
themselves? the reason<lb/>
is, no body else durst do<lb/>
it. In those times the <normalised orig="souldiers" auto="true">soldiers</normalised><lb/>
bare all the sway, assumed<lb/>
all power to make Kings<lb/>
and <normalised orig="Emperours" auto="true">Emperors</normalised>. But since the<lb/>
Priest <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> done the like,<lb/>
putting the <normalised orig="Souldier" auto="true">Soldier</normalised> by. And<lb/>
now the Peasant thinks <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised><lb/>
come to his turn, under pretence<lb/>
of his <normalised orig="priviledge" auto="true">privilege</normalised> in<lb/>
Parliament: he would dispose<lb/>
of Kings and Commonwealths,<lb/>
and rather then return<lb/>
it to the Priest from<lb/>
whom he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> taken it,<lb/>
would cast the course back<lb/>
again upon the <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised>.<lb/>
Nothing now contents the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Commonalty" auto="true">Commonality</normalised> but <normalised orig="Warre" auto="true">War</normalised> and<lb/>
Contention; he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> taken a<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="49">48</fw>
                  <pb n="49"/>
                  <lb/>
surfeit of peace, the very<lb/>
name of it <normalised orig="growes" auto="true">grows</normalised> odious:<lb/>
Now to give the <normalised orig="Souldier" auto="true">Soldier</normalised> his<lb/>
<normalised orig="Pasport" auto="true">Passport</normalised>, we <normalised orig="summe" auto="true">sum</normalised> up four<lb/>
exceptions against his saying;<lb/>
First, it is not verisimile,<lb/>
the unlikelihood of it <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised><lb/>
appeared in every Contradictory.<lb/>
Secondly, They were<lb/>
                  ignari rerum, had no information<lb/>
of what they affirm;<lb/>
neither eye, nor ear-witness<lb/>
of what they say, for they<lb/>
confess themselves asleep.<lb/>
Thirdly, Their saying is<lb/>
contrary to what they had<lb/>
said before; in the morning<lb/>
they told another tale, at<lb/>
the eleventh verse of this<lb/>
Chapter; if that were true,<lb/>
this is false; if that were<lb/>
not true, why should we believe<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="50">D</fw>
                  <pb n="50"/>
                  <lb/>
this? or who will<lb/>
trust men in contrary tales?<lb/>
Lastly, the parties were<lb/>
corrupted, hired with a large<lb/>
<normalised orig="summe" auto="true">sum</normalised> to utter their saying,<lb/>
at the twelfth verse.<lb/>
These two latter lie without<lb/>
the Text, and therefore I<lb/>
wholly forbear them, especially<lb/>
for the point of corruption:<lb/>
<normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> a crafty crime,<lb/>
and commonly hard to<lb/>
prove. We also forbear the<lb/>
lie to the <normalised orig="Souldier" auto="true">Soldier</normalised>, because<lb/>
he <normalised orig="abhorres" auto="true">abhors</normalised> it. But to the<lb/>
Priests who put this lie in<lb/>
their mouths, and to their<lb/>
Disciple-Priests who at this<lb/>
day practise lying, and allow<lb/>
it to be lawful, we would<lb/>
mend the old saying,<lb/>
A Liar should have a good<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="51">50</fw>
                  <pb n="51"/>
                  <lb/>
memory, and rather require<lb/>
in him a good Wit. His<lb/>
memory serves but to avoid<lb/>
contradictions of himself,<lb/>
but his Wit to prevent<lb/>
the contradictions of<lb/>
others, that an untruth<lb/>
seem not also unlikely. If<lb/>
therefore the Priests would<lb/>
have lied wisely, and with<lb/>
credit, like Satan himself, the<lb/>
Serpent whom they served,<lb/>
they should, as they did formerly,<lb/>
have laid our Saviour<lb/>
to Satan's charge, and have<lb/>
said, that the foul Fiend<lb/>
came by night &amp; <normalised orig="fetcht" auto="true">fetched</normalised> him<lb/>
away; leaving out, <normalised orig="whil'st" auto="true">whilst</normalised> the<lb/>

have argued from the descent<lb/>
of the Angel, and the<lb/>
earthquake: this could not so<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="52">D 2</fw>

                  <lb/>
easily have been discovered;<lb/>
but it might even as easily,<lb/>
where Faith had a Fortification;<lb/>
Humane reasons urged<lb/>
against it are but as Papershot.<lb/>
Carnal wisdom working<lb/>
against God is but dirt<lb/>
and rottenness. Our counsels<lb/>
are confounded, when<lb/>
carried against Christ. And<lb/>
so I come to my third and<lb/>
last Cursory, upon the word<lb/>
of our Saviour.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Hitherto we have cleared<lb/>
the Disciples, but we must<lb/>
also give the <normalised orig="Souldier" auto="true">Soldier</normalised> content.<lb/>
There is no such<lb/>
difference, but the matter<lb/>
may be reconciled, and<lb/>
the question stated on the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised> side. Said I not,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="53">52</fw>
                  <pb n="53"/>
                  <lb/>
it was the fashion? The<lb/>
<normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised> then are in the <lb/>
right, their saying very<lb/>
sound and Christian; A<lb/>
Disciple of his did come by<lb/>
night, and stole him away,<lb/>
and the <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised> were asleep.<lb/>
A Disciple of his,<lb/>
and his most beloved Disciple,<lb/>
his humane soul came<lb/>
by night, was united to his<lb/>
body, raised it, and withdrew<lb/>
it from the <normalised orig="Sepulcher" auto="true">Sepulchre</normalised><lb/>
by stealth, while the <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised><lb/>
were so between<lb/>

as the words lie in order,<lb/>
declining all emergent<lb/>

                  <lb/>
We term him a Disciple,<lb/>
who receives knowledge<lb/>
and chastisement from another.<lb/>
As our Saviour<lb/>
was God, his soul was<lb/>
                  NoValue, the truest and<lb/>
most proper Disciple that<lb/>
ever was: it had received<lb/>
both knowledge and chastisement,<lb/>
as never man<lb/>
had, knowledge of all manner,<lb/>
both Divine and Humane,<lb/>
infused and acquired: <lb/>
but whether it had<lb/>
no Ignorance, we leave<lb/>
it to the <normalised orig="Catholicks" auto="true">Catholics</normalised>. And<lb/>
all manner of chastisement,<lb/>
both exemplary,<lb/>
and satisfactory, for all<lb/>
                  <pb n="55"/>
                  <lb/>
Mankind; the chastisement<lb/>
of our peace was<lb/>
upon it: but whether it<lb/>
satisfied for Reprobates,<lb/>
we leave it to the Arminians.<lb/>
His soul came, it<lb/>
could move, for it was<lb/>
separate; the soul was<lb/>
from the body, though<lb/>
neither from the <normalised orig="Godhead" auto="true">Godhood</normalised>:<lb/>
as all the rest of<lb/>
the Disciples, it forsook<lb/>
him on the <normalised orig="Crosse" auto="true">Cross</normalised>, and<lb/>

upon its own force, and<lb/>
without any help of others:<lb/>
But whether attended and<lb/>
waited upon by a troop of<lb/>
Angels, we leave it to the<lb/>
Fathers. For the time, it<lb/>
came by Night, not for<lb/>
fear of the Jews, as Nicodemus<lb/>
came to him, but<lb/>
for love of his promise,<lb/>
that he might rise the<lb/>
third day. He came the<lb/>
second Night, the Night<lb/>
second to his Passion, but<lb/>
third to the day of his Resurrection,<lb/>
some time between<lb/>

Mid-night and Morning;<lb/>
but at what time, we<lb/>
leave it to the Chronologers.<lb/>
The Unde of its<lb/>
coming was from somewhere<lb/>
else, from a distant<lb/>
Ubi, for it was not come<lb/>
before it came: but from<lb/>
whence definitively, whether<lb/>
from Heaven or Hell,<lb/>
we leave it to the Calvinists.<lb/>
The Qu√≤ or Term of its<lb/>
coming was the Grave, he<lb/>
subsisted there; but the<lb/>
end of the Comer, was the<lb/>
Re-union to the body, to<lb/>
make his real presence there:<lb/>
but whether thereby he became<lb/>
                  omnipresent, to be every<lb/>
where while he was in the<lb/>
grave, we leave to the Lutherans.<lb/>
His final intent, not to <lb/>

not <normalised orig="dismembred" auto="true">dismembered</normalised>, nor any way<lb/>
corrupted, not so much as in <lb/>

but to animate those members,<lb/>
and to raise the body<lb/>
from the grave, in which<lb/>
action both the body and<lb/>
the soul had their mutual efficiency,<lb/>
each co-elevating<lb/>
other to make up the Resurrection: <lb/>
but whether these<lb/>
two Agents imply several operations<lb/>
really distinct, we<lb/>
leave it to the Nominalists.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
The manner of his resurrection<lb/>
so miraculous and ineffable,<lb/>
that <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> words express<lb/>
it best. In a moral relation<lb/>

                  <pb n="59"/>
                  <lb/>
termed stealing: not <choice ana="illegible">

what our Saviour did in his<lb/>
rising, but to intimate what<lb/>
the Jews had committed by<lb/>
their crucifying. Things of<lb/>
a super-eminent nature are<lb/>
fain to borrow words of an<lb/>
<normalised orig="inferiour" auto="true">inferior</normalised> signification, when<lb/>
they are related to a low capacity;<lb/>
so God gives himself<lb/>
attributes, not as he is,<lb/>
but according to the <normalised orig="weaknesse" auto="true">weakness</normalised><lb/>
whereby man apprehends<lb/>
him. And here the<lb/>
action of our Saviour is set<lb/>
down, not as it is done, but<lb/>
according to the wickedness<lb/>
that the Jews had done.<lb/>
The active signification of<lb/>
stealing belongs to our Saviour,<lb/>
but the moral evil of<lb/>
it reflected upon others.<lb/>
                  <pb n="60"/>
                  <lb/>
The Law saith, he steals<lb/>
who fraudulently takes away<lb/>
something of <normalised orig="anothers" auto="true">another</normalised>,<lb/>
with intent to get the thing<lb/>
it self, its use or possession; <lb/>
if this definition be true, his<lb/>
resurrection was stealing. His<lb/>
body was now cadaver puniti,<lb/>
the carcase of one that<lb/>
had <normalised orig="publickly" auto="true">publicly</normalised> suffered, and<lb/>
thereby forfeit to the State;<lb/>
no man might meddle with<lb/>
it further then to bury it,<lb/>
not that without special permission;<lb/>
it was now none of<lb/>
his, his right and possession<lb/>
of it both gone; tradiderat,<lb/>
he had made delivery of it,<lb/>
dispensed and passed it away<lb/>
to <normalised orig="Pilat" auto="true">Pilate</normalised>: <normalised orig="Pilat" auto="true">Pilate</normalised> disposed his<lb/>
right to bury it, to the<lb/>
Watch to detain it, and now<lb/>
                  <pb n="61"/>
                  <lb/>
it was theirs. When therefore<lb/>
he took it from the <lb/>
Grave, he stole it: his repossession<lb/>
of it defrauded all the<lb/>
Pr√¶-detainers. Said they not<lb/>
also he was a Deceiver?<lb/>
But whether the Angel that<lb/>
rolled away the stone, were<lb/>
necessary or ministerial, we<lb/>
leave it to the Hermonists.<lb/>
By natural relation his body<lb/>
was his own, as being the<lb/>
essential and proper counter-part<lb/>
of his soul, pr√¶ coexistent<lb/>
with it in one person;<lb/>
but morally it was not<lb/>
so, or if it were, yet he<lb/>
might steal it for all that. A<lb/>
man may steal that which is<lb/>
his own, by interverting that<lb/>
right in it which <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been<lb/>
transferred to another: and<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="62">61</fw>
                  <pb n="62"/>
                  <lb/>
what kind of Theft this was,<lb/>
we leave it to the Lawyers.<lb/>
God forbid we should lay<lb/>
other Theft to our Saviour,<lb/>
then that he attributes to<lb/>
himself, in saying, He came<lb/>
like a Thief in the night,<lb/>
(i.e.) secretly and unawares:<lb/>
so was his conveyance<lb/>
from the Grave, close,<lb/>
without the consent and notice<lb/>
of those that were present;<lb/>
such a carriage we<lb/>
commonly call stealth. We<lb/>
steal away from a room,<lb/>
when we depart without the<lb/>
knowledge of the Company:<lb/>
But whether he could convey<lb/>
himself so closely, as to<lb/>
<normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> thorough the Tombestone,<lb/>
we leave it to the Philosophers.<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="63">62</fw>
                  <pb n="63"/>
                  <lb/>
Yet so close it was, that<lb/>
the Watch perceived it not,<lb/>
for they were asleep; they<lb/>
were set to watch it, but<lb/>
they did not. Not to watch<lb/>
is all one with not to be awake,<lb/>
and that with to <choice ana="print-error">

or careless of what<lb/>
<normalised orig="passeth" auto="true">passes</normalised>, as the contrary we<lb/>
<normalised orig="terme" auto="true">term</normalised> vigilant: so the Watch<lb/>
was fast asleep, they never<lb/>
gave heed to the Resurrection;<lb/>
that so <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> from their<lb/>
belief, that they had no opinion<lb/>
of it. But if death be<lb/>
a kind of sleep, he is <normalised orig="foundly" auto="false">soundly</normalised><lb/>
asleep that lies for dead,<lb/>
and so did the Watch, in the <lb/>
4th verse of this Chapter,<lb/>
                  NoValue, for fear<lb/>
                  <pb n="64"/>
                  <lb/>
of the Angel they fell a shaking,<lb/>
and became as dead<lb/>
men. His presence gave<lb/>
them a strong <choice ana="print-error">

                     <corr>Dormitive</corr>

it wrought beyond sleep.<lb/>
Sleep <normalised orig="reacheth" auto="true">reaches</normalised> but only to<lb/>
a Ligation of sense; but in<lb/>
them all motion ceased,<lb/>
they were examinate: but<lb/>
whether that fit held them<lb/>
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> by way of Syncope, or<lb/>
did determine in a Cataphora, <lb/>
or soporiferous passion, we<lb/>
leave it to the <normalised orig="Physitians" auto="true">Physicians</normalised>.<lb/>
Fearful and Cowardish <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised>,<lb/>
more womanish than women! <lb/>
At the presence of<lb/>
the Angel the Women stand<lb/>
upright, but the <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised><lb/>
fall in a <normalised orig="swoun" auto="true">swoon</normalised>. Help them<lb/>
good Women, unbutton the<lb/>

                  <lb/>
their <normalised orig="Halberts" auto="true">Halberds</normalised>. There's work<lb/>
for you and your Spices,<lb/>
your odours to comfort and<lb/>
recall their Spirits. Bestow<lb/>
that Charity on the dying<lb/>
<normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised> which you intended<lb/>
on your dear Saviour;<lb/>
for he is risen, and needs<lb/>
them not, but they may benefit<lb/>
the <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised>. The<lb/>
<normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised> used to such fits,<lb/>
they had one of them the other<lb/>
night in Gethsemane; but<lb/>
whether these dejections<lb/>
were sins in the <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised>,<lb/>
we leave to the Casuits.<lb/>
Thus they were NoValue,<lb/>
laid as men asleep; for it<lb/>
signifies rather the reclination<lb/>
or posture of one asleep,<lb/>
then the affection of sleep<lb/>
it self. He that lies still<lb/>
                  <pb n="66"/>
                  <lb/>
without sense or motion, <lb/>
whether he be in a sleep, or<lb/>
trance, or dead, we say<lb/>
                  NoValue, and we call the<lb/>
Church-yard NoValue, because<lb/>
the dead lie there as<lb/>
if they were asleep, they stir<lb/>
not. And so we must all be<lb/>
<normalised orig="layd" auto="true">laid</normalised>. There's no Dormitory.<lb/>
Our case somewhat like the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised>: We are appointed<lb/>
here to watch our Saviour;<lb/>
and as we do it, we are subject<lb/>
to the <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised> infirmity,<lb/>
apt to be cast asleep, and<lb/>
become as dead men. Yet<lb/>
let us not be subject to their<lb/>
fear, our death is but like<lb/>
their <normalised orig="swouning" auto="false">swooning</normalised>, that's the<lb/>
worst. We are liable to rise<lb/>
again, and our Resurrection<lb/>
shall be like our Saviours:<lb/>
                  <pb n="67"/>
                  <lb/>
His and ours make a mutual<lb/>
Aspect; His the Specimen,<lb/>
and ours the Complement.<lb/>
What he practised on himself<lb/>
he perfects in us: He<lb/>
will come again by night,<lb/>
and steal us to glory, while<lb/>
we lie sleeping in the Grave.<lb/>
