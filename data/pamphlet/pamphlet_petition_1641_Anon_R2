rather then the Church should have <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> deprived of their <lb/>

That the Discipline, and Excommunication may be <normalised orig="administred" auto="true">administered</normalised> <lb/>
according to Christs own institution. Or at the least, that <lb/>
enormities may be redressed. As namely, That Excommunication <lb/>

the Oath ex Officio, whereby men are forced to accuse themselves <lb/>
be more sparingly used. That licenses for <normalised orig="mariage" auto="true">marriage</normalised> without Banes <lb/>
asked, be more cautiously granted. <lb/>
These with such other Abuses yet <normalised orig="remayning" auto="true">remaining</normalised> and practised in <lb/>
the Church of England, we are able to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised>, not to be agreeable <lb/>
to the Scriptures, if it shall please your <normalised orig="Highnesse" auto="true">Highness</normalised> further to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> <lb/>
us, or more at large by writing to be <normalised orig="enformed" auto="true">informed</normalised>, or by conference <lb/>
among the learned to be resolved. And yet we doubt not, but <lb/>
that without any farther <normalised orig="processe" auto="true">process</normalised>, your Majesty (of whose Christian <lb/>
judgement we have received so good a <normalised orig="tast" auto="true">taste</normalised> already) is able of <lb/>
your <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> to judge of the equity of this cause, God wee trust <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
appointed your <normalised orig="Highnesse" auto="true">Highness</normalised> our Physician, to <normalised orig="heale" auto="true">heal</normalised> these diseases. <lb/>
And we say with Mordecay to Hester, who <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised>, whether <lb/>
you are come to the <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> for such a time? Thus <lb/>
your Majesty shall do that, which we are <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised>, shall be acceptable <lb/>
to God, <normalised orig="honorable" auto="true">honourable</normalised> to your <normalised orig="Majestie" auto="true">Majesty</normalised> in all succeeding ages, <lb/>
profitable to his Church which shall be thereby <normalised orig="encreased" auto="true">increased</normalised>, comfortable <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
to your Ministers, which shall be no more suspended, silenced, <lb/>
disgraced, imprisoned for <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> traditions: and <normalised orig="prejudiciall" auto="true">prejudicial</normalised> to <lb/>
none, but to those that <normalised orig="seeke" auto="true">seek</normalised> their own quiet, credit, and profit in <lb/>
the World. Thus with all <normalised orig="dutifull" auto="true">dutiful</normalised> submission, referring our selves <lb/>
to your Majesties pleasure, for your gracious answer, as God shall <lb/>
direct you, we most humbly recommend your <normalised orig="Highnesse" auto="true">Highness</normalised> to the divine <lb/>
Majesty; whom we beseech for Christ his sake to dispose your <lb/>
<normalised orig="royall" auto="true">royal</normalised> heart to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> herein, what shall be to his glory, the good of his <lb/>
