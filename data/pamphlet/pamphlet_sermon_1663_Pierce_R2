OF THE FAITH which was once<lb/>
<normalised orig="deliver'd" auto="true">delivered</normalised> unto the Saints, cannot possibly<lb/>
<normalised orig="chuse" auto="true">choose</normalised> but be so to him, who does earnestly<lb/>
contend for the very same, because<lb/>
for no other Faith then That<lb/>
which was from the Beginning. If<lb/>
for This I have contended with as much<lb/>
earnestness from the Pulpit, as The<lb/>
Romanists from the Press do contend<lb/>
against it; I have not only the Exhortation<lb/>
and Authority of a Text, but the<lb/>
Exigence of the Time to excuse me in it.<lb/>
Now as the Romans in the Time of<lb/>
the second <normalised orig="Punick" auto="false">punic</normalised> War, could not<lb/>
think of a fitter way for the driving of<lb/>
<normalised orig="Hanibal" auto="false">Hannibal</normalised> out of Italy, then Scipio's marching<lb/>
with an Army out of Italy into<lb/>
<normalised orig="Afrique" auto="false">Africa</normalised>, giving <normalised orig="Hanibal" auto="false">Hannibal</normalised> a Necessity<lb/>
to go from Rome, for the raising of the<lb/>
Siege which was laid to Carthage; So<lb/>
could I not think of a fitter Course to disappoint<lb/>
the Pontificians in their Attempts<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
on Our Church, then thus by making<lb/>
it their Task to view the Infirmities<lb/>
of their own. To which effect I was excited<lb/>
to spend my self, and to be spent, (if I<lb/>
may speak in the phrase of our Great Apostle,)<lb/>
not from an arrogant Opinion of<lb/>
any sufficiency in my self, (who am one<lb/>
of the least among the Regular Sons of the<lb/>
Church of England;) But as relying on<lb/>
the sufficiency of the Cause I took in<lb/>
hand, &amp; especially on the Help of the Allsufficient,<lb/>
who often loves to make use of<lb/>
the weakest Instruments, to effect the<lb/>
bringing down of the strongest Holds.<lb/>
I suppose my Discourse, however innocent<lb/>
in it self, will yet be likely to meet with<lb/>
many, not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> learned and <normalised orig="subtil" auto="true">subtle</normalised>, but<lb/>
restless enemies; Men of pleasant Insinuations,<lb/>
and very plausible, Snares;<lb/>
nay, such as are apt (where they have<lb/>
Power) to confute their Opponents<lb/>
by Fire and Faggot. But when I consider <lb/>
how well my Margin does lend Protection<lb/>

                  <lb/>
on to my Text, (for I reckon that my<lb/>
Citations, which I could not with Prudence<lb/>
represent out of a Pulpit, are the<lb/>
usefullest part of my whole Performance,<lb/>
because the Evidence and Warrant<lb/>
of all the rest;) I cannot fearfully apprehend,<lb/>
what Wit or Language (or ill<lb/>
<normalised orig="us'd" auto="true">used</normalised> Learning) can do against it, so far<lb/>
forth as it is <normalised orig="arm'd" auto="true">armed</normalised> with Notoriety of<lb/>
Fact in its Vindication; and <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> the<lb/>

by them of their own <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised>,<lb/>
with <normalised orig="honor" auto="true">honour</normalised>, or safety, be contradicted.<lb/>
If they are guilty in their Writings,<lb/>
it is rather their own, then their Readers<lb/>
Fault; Nor is it their Readers, but<lb/>
Their misfortune, if they are found So to<lb/>
be by their own Concessions. Nor can<lb/>
they rationally be angry at their Reader's <lb/>
Necessity to believe them; especially<lb/>
when they write with so becoming a<lb/>
proof of Impartiality, as that by which<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
they asperse and accuse Themselves. If<lb/>
it finally shall appear, They are <normalised orig="condemn'd" auto="true">condemned</normalised><lb/>
out of their <normalised orig="mouthes" auto="true">mouths</normalised>, (as Goliah's<lb/>
Head was cut off by David, not<lb/>
with David's, but with Goliah's own<lb/>
Sword,) and that I am not so severe in<lb/>
taking Notice of their Confessions, as<lb/>
They have been unto Themselves in the<lb/>
Printing of them, (for I cannot be said to<lb/>
have revealed any secrets, by <normalised orig="meerly" auto="true">merely</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="shewing" auto="true">showing</normalised> before the Sun, what They<lb/>
have sent into the Light,) I think, however<lb/>
They may have Appetite, They<lb/>
cannot have Reason to complain.<lb/>
I have <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised> of many Subjects<lb/>
within the Compass of an hour, on each of<lb/>
which it would be <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> to spend a year.<lb/>
But I have spoken most at large of the Supremacy <lb/>
of the Pope; as well because it <lb/>

If herein, as I have <normalised orig="obey'd" auto="true">obeyed</normalised>, I shall<lb/>

The sole Discharge of my Duty<lb/>

THere are but very few things<lb/>

First for Art; Any part of Philosophy <normalised orig="penn'd" auto="true">penned</normalised><lb/>

And as it is in the Things of Art, so is it<lb/>
also in those of Nature. How do the Gentlemen <lb/>

Antiquity? and yet they travel for their <choice ana="illegible">

no farther back then the siege of Troy: whereas<lb/>
the Arcadians derive their Pedigree even<lb/>
from Jupiter and Calisto, and will needs have<lb/>
their Nation exceed the Moon in Seniority.<lb/>
Nay, though <normalised orig="Ægypt" auto="true">Egypt</normalised> (in the Judgment of Diodorus <lb/>
the Siceleote) <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> better pretensions<lb/>
then any other, yet the Barbarians as well as<lb/>
Greeks have still affected a Primogeniture. Nay<lb/>
so far has this Ambition transported some, that<lb/>
they will needs have been begun from before<lb/>
the Protoplast, as it were itching to be as old as<lb/>
the Julian period, 764 years before the beginning<lb/>
of the World. Thus Antiquity <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been<lb/>
courted in Art and Nature.<lb/>
If in the third place we come to <normalised orig="Politie" auto="true">Polity</normalised>, we<lb/>
shall find Customs gaining Reverence from the<lb/>
sole merit of their Duration. And as a Custom<lb/>
by <normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> Continuance does wear it self into a<lb/>
Law; so the more aged a Law is grown, the<lb/>
less <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> liable to a Repeal; by how much the<lb/>
more it is stricken in years, by so much the less<lb/>
it is decrepit: And that for this reason, because<lb/>
the longer it endures, the more it inclines<lb/>
to its perfection; that is to say, its immortality.<lb/>

                  <lb/>
Last of all for Religion, the Case is clear out<lb/>
of Tertullian. Id verius quod prius, id prius quod<lb/>
ab initio. That Religion was the truest, which<lb/>
was the first; and that the first, which was from<lb/>
the beginning. And as He against Marcion, so<lb/>
Justin Martyr against the Grecians, did prove<lb/>
the Divinity of the Pentateuch from the Antiquity<lb/>
of its Writer. The <normalised orig="Jewes" auto="true">Jews</normalised> <normalised orig="enjoy'd" auto="true">enjoyed</normalised> the first<lb/>
Lawgiver by the Confession of the Gentiles. Moses<lb/>
preached the God of Abraham, whilst Thales<lb/>
Milesius was yet unborn. Nor was it a thing<lb/>
to be <normalised orig="imagin'd" auto="true">imagined</normalised>, that God should suffer the<lb/>
Devil to have a <normalised orig="Chappel" auto="true">Chapel</normalised> in the world, before<lb/>
himself had any Church. And thence Vincentius<lb/>

Doctrine, or the <choice ana="illegible">

the Case from a Threefold <normalised orig="Topick" auto="true">Topic</normalised>; The Universality,<lb/>
the Consent, and the Antiquity of a Tradition.<lb/>
Which Rule if we apply unto the scope of<lb/>
this Text, as it stands in relation unto the<lb/>
Context, we shall have more to say for it then<lb/>
for most Constitutions, divine, or humane: For That<lb/>
of <normalised orig="Mariage" auto="true">Marriage</normalised> is almost as old as Nature. There<lb/>
was no sooner one man, but God divided him <lb/>
into two; And then no sooner were there<lb/>
two, but he united them into one. This is<lb/>
That sacred Institution which was made with<lb/>
Mankind in a state of Innocence; the very<lb/>
Ground and Foundation of all both sacred and<lb/>

                  <lb/>
civil Government. It was by sending back<lb/>
the Pharisees to the most venerable Antiquity,<lb/>
that our Lord here asserted the Law of wedlock,<lb/>
against the old Custom of their Divorce. Whilst<lb/>
they had made themselves drunk with their<lb/>
muddy streams, He directed them to the Fountain,<lb/>
to drink <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised> into sobriety. They insisted <lb/>
altogether on the Mosaical Dispensation; But<lb/>
He <normalised orig="endeavour'd" auto="true">endeavoured</normalised> to reform them by the most<lb/>
Primitive Institution. They <normalised orig="alledged" auto="true">alleged</normalised> a Custom,<lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>b*t</sic>

                  </choice> He a Law. They a Permission, and that from<lb/>
Moses; But He a Precept, and that from God.<lb/>
They did reckon from afar off; But not, as He,<lb/>
from the Beginning.<lb/>
In that one Question of the Pharisees, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 19.7">Why<lb/>
did Moses command us to give her a writing of<lb/>
Divorce, and to put her away?</quote> they put a Fallacy <lb/>
upon Christ, <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> Plurium Interrogationum.<lb/>
For Moses <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> permitted them to put her away;<lb/>
but commanded them (if they did) to give her<lb/>
a writing of Divorce. And accordingly their<lb/>
Fallacy is detected by Christ in his Answer to<lb/>
them. Moses (did not command, but <normalised orig="meerly" auto="true">merely</normalised>)<lb/>
<normalised orig="suffer'd" auto="true">suffered</normalised> you in your custom of making unjustifiable<lb/>
Divorcements. NoValue, he permitted,<lb/>
that is to say, he did not punish it; not<lb/>
allowing it as good, but winking at it as the lesser<lb/>
of two great evils. He <normalised orig="suffer'd" auto="true">suffered</normalised> it to be safe<lb/>
in foro Soli; could not secure you from the<lb/>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
Guilt, for which you must answer in foro Poli.<lb/>
And why did he suffer what he could not<lb/>
approve? Not for the softness of your heads,<lb/>
which made you ignorant of your Duties; but<lb/>
for the hardness of your hearts, which made you<lb/>
resolute not to do them: you were so barbarous<lb/>
and brutish upon every slight Cause, (or Occasion<lb/>
rather,) that if you might not put her away,<lb/>
you would use her worse. You would<lb/>
many times beat, and sometimes murder, sometimes<lb/>
bury her alive, by bringing another into<lb/>
her Bed. So that the Liberty of Divorce, however<lb/>
a <normalised orig="poyson" auto="true">poison</normalised> in it self, was (through the hardness<lb/>
of your hearts) permitted to you for an Antidote:<lb/>
But from the Beginning it was not so.<lb/>
And you must put a wide difference betwixt<lb/>
an Indulgence of Man, and a Law of God. To<lb/>
state the <normalised orig="controversie" auto="true">controversy</normalised> aright, you must compare<lb/>
the first Precept with your customary Practice;<lb/>
not reckoning as far as from Moses <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>,<lb/>
but as far as from Adam too; you must not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <lb/>
look forward from the year of the Creation<lb/>
2400. but backward from thence unto the <lb/>
year of the Creation. The way to understand <lb/>
the Husband's Duty towards the Wife, (and<lb/>
so to reform, as not to innovate,) is to consider<lb/>
the words of God when he made the Wife out<lb/>
of the Husband. For <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 19.4">He that made them at</quote>

Thus our Saviour, being sent to Reform the<lb/>
Jews, made known the Rule of his Reformation.<lb/>
And the Lesson which it affords us is (in my<lb/>
poor judgment) of great Importance. For when<lb/>
the Doctrine or Discipline of our Church <normalised orig="establisht" auto="true">established</normalised> <lb/>
here in England shall be attempted by the<lb/>
Corruptions of <normalised orig="Moderne" auto="true">Modern</normalised> Pharisees, who shall assert<lb/>
against us (as these here did against our Saviour) <lb/>
either their <normalised orig="forreign" auto="true">foreign</normalised> Superstitions, (to say<lb/>
no worse) or their <normalised orig="domestick" auto="true">domestic</normalised> Profanations, (to,<lb/>
say no more;) we cannot better deal with them,<lb/>
then as our Saviour here dealt with the ancient<lb/>
Pharisees; that is, we cannot better put them to<lb/>
shame &amp; silence, then by demonstrating the Novelty<lb/>
and base extraction of their Pretensions,<lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
whilst we evince at the same instant the Sacred<lb/>
Antiquity of our <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised>. When they obtrude their<lb/>
Revelations, or teach for Doctrines of God the <normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised><lb/>
commandments of Men, we must <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> them every<lb/>
one, how they read in the beginning. We may not<lb/>
draw out of their Ditches be the Currents never<lb/>
so long, whilst we have waters of our own of a<lb/>
nobler Taste, which we can easily trace back to<lb/>
the crystal spring.<lb/>
And first of all it <normalised orig="concernes" auto="true">concerns</normalised> us to <normalised orig="marke" auto="true">mark</normalised> the<lb/>
Emphasis, which our Ancient of <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> thought<lb/>
fit to put on the Beginning, that no inferior Antiquity<lb/>
may be in danger to deceive us. For<lb/>
there is hardly any <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised> or Usurpation in the<lb/>
Church, which may not truly pretend to some<lb/>
great Antiquity, though not so old as the Old<lb/>
man, much <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> as the Old Serpent. The<lb/>
Disciplinarians may fetch theirs from as far as<lb/>
the <normalised orig="Heretick" auto="true">Heretic</normalised> NoValue; who wanting merit to<lb/>
advance him from a Presbyter to a Bishop,<lb/>
wanted not arrogance and envy to lessen the<lb/>
Bishop into a Presbyter. But His Antiquity<lb/>
is a Junior, as well to that of the Anabaptists,<lb/>
as to that of the Socinians. For the Anabaptists<lb/>
may boast they are as old as Agrippinus,<lb/>
and the Socinians as Sabellius. The Solifidians <lb/>
and Antinomians are come as far as from<lb/>
Eunomius. The Ranters from Carpocrates:<lb/>
The Millenaries from Papias. The Irrespective<lb/>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
Reprobatarians from Simon Magus<lb/>
and the Manichees. The Pontificians (like the<lb/>
Mahumetans) have such a Rhapsody of Religion, a<lb/>
Religion so compounded of several Errors and Corruptions,<lb/>
(which yet are blended with many<lb/>
Doctrines most sound and Orthodox,) that to find<lb/>
out the age of their <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> Ingredients, it will<lb/>
be necessary to rake into several times too.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
THe great Palladium of the Conclave, the<lb/>
famous point of Infallibility (which if you<lb/>

it being absolutely impossible that the learned<lb/>
Members of such a Church should glibly swallow<lb/>
so many Errors, unless by swallowing<lb/>

better derive then from the Scholars of<lb/>
Marcus in Irenæus, or from the Gnosticks in<lb/>
Epiphanius. They had their Purgatory<lb/>
from <normalised orig="Origen" auto="true">Origin</normalised>, (one of the best indeed in one<lb/>

                  <lb/>
then the <normalised orig="Arch-Heretick" auto="true">arch-heretic</normalised> Montanus.<lb/>
Nor does Bellarmine mend the matter, by deriving<lb/>
it as far as from Virgil's Æneid, and<lb/>
from Tully in his Tale of the Dream of Scipio,<lb/>
and farther yet from Plato's Gorgias; unless<lb/>
he thinks that an Heathen is any whit fitter<lb/>
then an <normalised orig="Heretick" auto="true">Heretic</normalised>, to give Advantage to a <lb/>
point of the Roman Faith. Their Denial of<lb/>
Marriage to all that enter into the Priesthood,<lb/>
is dated by themselves but from Pope Calixtus. <lb/>
Their Transubstantiation is from<lb/>
the Lateran Council. Their Half-Communion<lb/>
is no older then since the times of Aquinas;<lb/>
unless they will own it from the Manichees, <lb/>
to give it the credit of more Antiquity.<lb/>
Their <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> praying before the people in<lb/>
an unknown Tongue, may be <normalised orig="fetcht" auto="true">fetched</normalised> indeed as<lb/>
far as from Gregory the Great. Their Invocation<lb/>
of Saints departed is no doubt an aged Error,<lb/>
though not so aged as they would have it<lb/>
for the gaining of honour to the Invention; because<lb/>
St. Austin does deny it to have been in<lb/>
his days. And (not to be endless in the beginning<lb/>
of such a limited Discourse, as must not<lb/>
presume to exceed an hour; though in so<lb/>
<normalised orig="fruitfull" auto="true">fruitful</normalised> a field of matter, <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> very difficult not to<lb/>

so our Adversaries of Rome have more to plead<lb/>
for Their <normalised orig="Errours" auto="true">Errors</normalised> then all the rest, because the<lb/>
rest were but as Mushroms in their <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> <lb/>

whereas the <normalised orig="Errours" auto="true">Errors</normalised> of Rome do enjoy the<lb/>

But touching each of those <normalised orig="Errours" auto="true">Errors</normalised>, (I mean<lb/>
the Errors of their Practice, as well as Judgment,)<lb/>
we can say with our Saviour in his present<lb/>
Correption of the Pharisees, (whose Error<lb/>
was older and more <normalised orig="authentick" auto="true">authentic</normalised>, that is, by<lb/>
Moses his permission had more appearance of<lb/>

we care not whence they come, <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> they<lb/>

Indeed in matters of <normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> Indifference which<lb/>
are brought into the Government or outward<lb/>
Discipline of the Church, every Church has the<lb/>
Liberty to make her own Constitutions, not<lb/>
asking leave of her Sisters, much less her<lb/>
Children; <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> they must not be reputed as <lb/>
things without which there is no Salvation, nor<lb/>
be obtruded upon the People amongst the<lb/>

                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
nothing so, but as it comes to us from the Beginning.<lb/>
And this has ever been the Rule (I mean<lb/>
the warrantable Rule) whereby to improve or<lb/>
reform a Church. When Esdras was intent<lb/>
on the re-building of the Temple, he sent not to<lb/>
Ephesus, much <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> to Rome; he did not imitate<lb/>
Diana's Temple, nor enquire into the<lb/>
Rituals of Numa Pompilius; but had recourse<lb/>
for a Temple, to that of Solomon, and for a<lb/>
Ritual, to that of Moses, as having both been <lb/>
prescribed by God himself. And yet we know<lb/>
the Prophet Haggai made the people steep their<lb/>
Joy in a <normalised orig="showre" auto="true">shower</normalised> of Tears, by representing how<lb/>
much the Copy had <normalised orig="faln" auto="true">fallen</normalised> short of the Original.<lb/>
The holy Prophets in the Old Testament,<lb/>
<normalised orig="shewing" auto="true">showing</normalised> the way to a Reformation, <normalised orig="advis'd" auto="true">advised</normalised> the<lb/>
Princes and the People to <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> after the old<lb/>
paths, and walk therein, as being the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> good<lb/>
way for the finding of rest unto their souls, Jer.<lb/>
6. 16. The Prophet Isaiah sought to regulate<lb/>
what was <normalised orig="amisse" auto="true">amiss</normalised> amongst the <normalised orig="Jewes" auto="true">Jews</normalised>, by bidding<lb/>
them have recourse unto the Law and the<lb/>
Testimony: <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 8.19">should not a people seek unto their God?</quote>
                  <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 8.20">If any speak not according to this word, it is because<lb/>

for it, That they walked in the ways of their<lb/>

Father David; that is, <normalised orig="reform'd" auto="true">reformed</normalised> what was <normalised orig="amisse" auto="true">amiss</normalised> <lb/>
by what had been from the Beginning.<lb/>
So St. Paul in the New Testament, setting<lb/>
right what was crooked about the Supper of the<lb/>
Lord in the Church of Corinth, laid his line to<lb/>
that Rule which he was sure he had <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 11.23"><normalised orig="receiv'd" auto="true">received</normalised><lb/>
from the Lord <normalised orig="Himselfe" auto="true">Himself</normalised></quote>. And <lb/>
thus our Saviour in my Text, finding the<lb/>
Pharisees very fond of a vicious practice, which<lb/>
supported it self by an old Tradition, and had<lb/>
something of Moses to give it countenance in the<lb/>
world, (though indeed no more then a bare<lb/>
permission,) could not think of a better way to<lb/>
make them sensible of their Error, (and such an<lb/>
Error as was their Sin too,) then by <normalised orig="shewing" auto="true">showing</normalised> <lb/>
them the great and important difference betwixt <lb/>
an old, and a primitive <normalised orig="Custome" auto="true">Custom</normalised>; and<lb/>
that however their breach of Wedlock had been<lb/>
without check from the days of yore, yet <normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> <lb/>
for this to be <normalised orig="reform'd" auto="true">reformed</normalised>, that <normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> not so from the<lb/>
Beginning. <lb/>
In a most <normalised orig="dutifull" auto="true">dutiful</normalised> Conformity to which<lb/>
example, our Reformers here in England<lb/>
(of happy memory) having <normalised orig="discover'd" auto="true">discovered</normalised> in<lb/>
every part of the Church of Rome, not<lb/>
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> horrible Corruptions in point of Practice,<lb/>
but hideous Errors in point of Doctrine,<lb/>
and that in matters of Faith too, (as I shall<lb/>

                  <pb n="17"/>
                  <lb/>
found by what degrees the <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> Errors<lb/>
and Corruptions were <normalised orig="slily" auto="false">slyly</normalised> brought into the<lb/>
Church, as well as the several times and seasons<lb/>
wherein the Novelties received their birth and<lb/>
breeding; and presently after taking notice,<lb/>
that in the Council of Trent the Roman Partisans <lb/>
were not afraid to make New Articles<lb/>
of Faith, whilst the Sacrifice of the Mass,<lb/>
the Doctrine of Purgatory, the Invocation of<lb/>
Saints, the Worship of Images, and the like,<lb/>
were commanded to be embraced under pain of<lb/>
damnation, (as it were in contempt of the Apostle's <lb/>
<normalised orig="denuntiation" auto="false">denunciation</normalised>, Gal. 1. 8. by which that <lb/>
practice of those Conspirators made them liable<lb/>
to a curse;) and farther yet, that in the<lb/>
Canon of the Fourth Session of that Council, the<lb/>
Roman Church was made to differ as well<lb/>
from her ancient and purer self, as from all other<lb/>
Churches besides her self, in that there were<lb/>
many <normalised orig="meerly" auto="true">merely</normalised> humane (I do not say profane)<lb/>
Writings, and many unwritten Traditions also,<lb/>
not only decreed to be of equal Authority with<lb/>
the Scriptures, but with the addition of an<lb/>

them: This (I say) being <normalised orig="consider'd" auto="true">considered</normalised> <choice ana="typeset-error">

to heart by our Reformers, (by our Kings, and<lb/>

their greatest both Ecclesiastical and Civil Councils,)<lb/>
they did not consult with flesh and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>,<lb/>
                  <pb n="18"/>
                  <lb/>
or expect the Court of Rome should become<lb/>
their Physician, which was indeed their great <lb/>
Disease; but having recourse unto the Scriptures <lb/>
and Primitive Fathers of the Church, they<lb/>
consulted those Oracles how things stood from<lb/>
the Beginning: And <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> separating from Them,<lb/>
whom they found to have been Separatists<lb/>
from the primitive Church, they therefore made<lb/>
a Secession, that they might not partake of the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Romane" auto="true">Roman</normalised> <normalised orig="Schisme" auto="true">Schism</normalised>. And whilst they made a Secession<lb/>
for fear of Schism; (which by no other<lb/>
practice could be avoided,) they studiously<lb/>
kept to the Golden mean; neither destroying<lb/>
the Body out of hatred to the Ulcers with<lb/>
which <normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> <normalised orig="spred" auto="true">spread</normalised>, nor yet retaining any Ulcer<lb/>
in a passionate dotage upon the Body. <lb/>
One remarkable Infirmity it is obvious to<lb/>
observe in the Popish Writers: they ever <normalised orig="complaine" auto="true">complain</normalised><lb/>
we have left their Church; but never<lb/>
<normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> us that lot, as to which we have left the<lb/>
Word of God, or the Apostles, or the yet uncorrupted <lb/>
and primitive Church, or the Four first<lb/>
<normalised orig="Generall" auto="true">General</normalised> Councils. We are so zealous for Antiquity,<lb/>
(provided it be but antique enough,) that<lb/>
we never have despised a <normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> Tradition, which<lb/>
we could track by sure footsteps from as far as<lb/>
the times of the purest Christians. But this is <lb/>
still their childish fallacy, (be it spoken to the<lb/>
shame of their greatest Giants in Dispute, who<lb/>

please to call it the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, not formally,<lb/>
but causally, (saith Cardinal Peron,) because<lb/>
forsooth that particular <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> infuse universality<lb/>
into all other Churches besides it<lb/>
self: The learned Cardinal forgetting, (which<lb/>
is often the effect of his very good memory,)<lb/>
that the preaching of Christ was to begin at<lb/>
Jerusalem. So it was in the <normalised orig="Prophesie" auto="true">Prophecy</normalised>, (Isa. 2.<lb/>
3. Mic. 4. 2.) and so in the completion, (Luke<lb/>
24. 47.) Nor was it Rome, but Antioch, in<lb/>
which the Disciples were first <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> Christians,<lb/>
(Act. 11. 26.) At Antioch therefore there<lb/>
was a Church, before St. Peter went thence to<lb/>
Rome. Nay <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> <normalised orig="expresly" auto="true">expressly</normalised> <normalised orig="affirm'd" auto="true">affirmed</normalised> by Gildas,<lb/>
(an Author very much revered by the Romanists<lb/>
themselves,) that Christianity was in Britain<lb/>
in the latter time of Tiberius <normalised orig="Cæsar" auto="true">Caesar</normalised>; some<lb/>
while after whose death, <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> known that<lb/>
St. Peter <normalised orig="remain'd" auto="true">remained</normalised> in Jewry. So that Rome<lb/>
which pretends to be a Mother, can be no more <lb/>
at the best then a Sister-Church, and not the eldest<lb/>
Sister neither.<lb/>
Neglecting therefore the pretended Universality <lb/>
of the Roman (that is to say, of a particular)<lb/>
Church; let us compare her Innovations<lb/>

Use, that we can make of the subject we<lb/>

a very old, and somewhat a prosperous<lb/>

from more then a thousand years ago. But<lb/>
then, besides that it was sold by the <normalised orig="Emperour" auto="true">Emperor</normalised><lb/>

and Pontius Pilate; and besides that it was<lb/>
sold to ambitious Boniface the Third, whose<lb/>
vile compliance with that Phocas was the bribe<lb/>
or price with which he bought it: and besides<lb/>
that it was done, not out of reverence to the<lb/>
Pope, but in displeasure to Cyriacus of <normalised orig="Constantinople" auto="true">Constantine</normalised>,<lb/>
who (from John his Predecessor)<lb/>
<normalised orig="usurpt" auto="true">usurped</normalised> the Title of <normalised orig="Vniversall" auto="true">Universal</normalised> before<lb/>

what our Saviour here said to the ancient Pharisees,<lb/>

Wall of God's City had Twelve Foundations, and in<lb/>

to Peter, when he withstood him to the face, and<lb/>
rebuked him in <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> for his Dissimulation.<lb/>
(Gal.2.11, 12, 13, 14) Nay S<hi rend="high">t</hi>. Peter himself, (as<lb/>

although he seemed to be a Pillar, yet perceiving the<lb/>
Grace that was given to Paul, gave to Barnabas<lb/>

And reason good: For S. Peter was but one of<lb/>

That the Apostles were every one of equal<lb/>
power and authority, is the positive saying of<lb/>
St. Cyprian, Pari confortio præditi &amp; honoris<lb/>
&amp; potestatis. And St. Jerome is as <normalised orig="expresse" auto="true">express</normalised>,<lb/>
That all Bishops, in all places, whether at<lb/>
Rome, or at Eugubium, at <normalised orig="Constantinople" auto="true">Constantine</normalised>,<lb/>
or at Rhegium, are of the very same merit, as<lb/>
to the quality of their Office; how much <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised><lb/>
they may differ in point of Revenue or of Endowments, <lb/>
Nay, by the Canons of the Two first <lb/>
General Councils, (Nice, and <normalised orig="Constantinople" auto="true">Constantine</normalised>,)<lb/>
every Patriarch and Bishop is appointed to<lb/>
be chief in his proper Diocese; as the Bishop of<lb/>
Rome is the chief in His: And a strict Injunction<lb/>
is laid on all, (the Bishop of Rome not<lb/>
                  <pb n="23"/>
                  <lb/>
excepted,) that they presume not to meddle in<lb/>
any Diocese but their own. And the chief<lb/>
Primacies of Order were granted to Rome and<lb/>
to <normalised orig="Constantinople" auto="true">Constantine</normalised>, not for their having been the<lb/>
Sees of such or such an Apostle, but for<lb/>
being the two Seats of the two great Empires.<lb/>
Witness the famous Canon of the <normalised orig="Generall" auto="true">General</normalised> Council<lb/>
at Chalcedon, decreeing to the Bishop of<lb/>
<normalised orig="Constantinople" auto="true">Constantine</normalised> an equality of <normalised orig="Priviledges" auto="true">Privileges</normalised> with the<lb/>
Bishop of Rome; not for any other reason,<lb/>
then its having the good hap to be one of the<lb/>
two Imperial Cities. Nay, no longer ago before<lb/>
Boniface the Third, (who was the first Bishop<lb/>
of Rome that <normalised orig="usurpt" auto="true">usurped</normalised> the Title of Universal,)<lb/>
I say, no longer before Him then his next<lb/>
immediate Predecessor Pope Gregory the Great,<lb/>
(for I reckon Sabinian was but a <normalised orig="Cypher" auto="true">Cipher</normalised>,)<lb/>
the horrible Pride of succeeding Popes was<lb/>
stigmariz'd by a Prolepsis; by way (not of<lb/>
Prophecy, but) of Anticipation. For Gregory<lb/>
writing to Mauritius the then reigning <normalised orig="Emperour" auto="true">Emperor</normalised><lb/>
(and that in very many Epistles,)<lb/>
touching the name of Universal, which the<lb/>
Bishop of <normalised orig="Constantinople" auto="true">Constantine</normalised> had vainly taken unto<lb/>
himself, calls it a wicked and profane and blasphemous<lb/>
Title; a Title importing, that the times <lb/>
of Antichrist were at hand; (little thinking that<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="20">D2</fw>
                  <pb n="24"/>
                  <lb/>
Pope Boniface would presently after his decease<lb/>
usurp the same, and prove the Pope to<lb/>
be Antichrist by the Confession of a Pope.) He<lb/>
farther disputed against the Title by an Argument<lb/>
leading ad absurdum; That if any one<lb/>
Bishop were Universal, there would by consequence <lb/>
be a failing of the Universal Church,<lb/>
upon the failing of such a Bishop. An Argument,<lb/>
                  ad homines, not easily to be <normalised orig="answer'd" auto="true">answered</normalised>,<lb/>
whatsoever Infirmity it may labour with in<lb/>
it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>. And such an Argument is That, which<lb/>
we bring against the Pope's pretended Headship. <lb/>
For if the Pope is the Head of the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised><lb/>
Church, then the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church must<lb/>
be the Body of the Pope; because the Head and<lb/>
the Body are the Relative and Correlative; and<lb/>
being such, they are convertible in obliqun: And<lb/>
then it follows unavoidably, That when<lb/>
there is no Pope at all, (which is very often,)<lb/>
the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> then no Head; and<lb/>
when there are many Popes at once, (which<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been sometimes the case,) then the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised><lb/>
Church must have at once many Heads;<lb/>
and when the Pope is Heretical, (as by the<lb/>
confession of the Papists he now and then is,)<lb/>
the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> such a Head as makes<lb/>
her deserve to be beheaded. That Popes have<lb/>
                  <pb n="25"/>
                  <lb/>
been <normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised> and Heathens too, not only by<lb/>
denying the <normalised orig="Godhead" auto="true">Godhood</normalised> of the Son, and by lifting<lb/>
him up above the other two Persons, but even<lb/>
by sacrificing to Idols, and a <normalised orig="totall" auto="true">total</normalised> <normalised orig="Apostacy" auto="true">Apostasy</normalised> from<lb/>
the Faith, is (a thing so clear in the writings<lb/>
of Platma and Onuphrius, that <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised>)<lb/>
the Confession of the most zealous and<lb/>
partial Asserters of their Supremacy. I know<lb/>
that Stella, and those of the Spanish Inqusition,<lb/>
do at once <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> this, and yet adhere<lb/>
to their Position, That (with his<lb/>
<normalised orig="Colledge" auto="true">College</normalised> of Cardinals) the Pope cannot <normalised orig="erre" auto="true">err</normalised>,<lb/>
and is the Head of the Church. But St. Hilary of<lb/>
Poictiers was so offended at Pope Liberius his<lb/>
espousing the Arian <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised>, that he <normalised orig="affirm'd" auto="true">affirmed</normalised><lb/>
the true Church to have been then <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> in<lb/>
France. Ex eo inter nos tantum Communio Dominica<lb/>

withal, who have been Flatterers of the Pope<lb/>
or the Court of Rome.<lb/>
To conclude this first Instance in the fewest<lb/>

at large (what I have time <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> to hint) the<lb/>
many Liberties and Exemptions of the Gallican<lb/>
Church, and the published Confessions of Popish <lb/>
writers, for more then a thousand years together,<lb/>

Right of Kings, put together by Goldastus in<lb/>
three great Volumes; he will not be able to<lb/>

                  <lb/>
deny, (let his present <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised> be what it <lb/>

Prosperous <normalised orig="Vsurpation" auto="true">Usurpation</normalised>, and <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> this lying against<lb/>
it, that <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 19.8"><normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> not so from the beginning.</quote>
                  <lb/>
Secondly <normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> true that for <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> Ages,<lb/>
the Church of Rome <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> pretended to be infallible;<lb/>

                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 19.8">But from the beginning it was not so.</quote> For, (besides<lb/>
that Infallibility is one of God's peculiar<lb/>

That <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised> is Error in point of Faith, and that<lb/>

that Rome it self was the Nest in which<lb/>

that the Tenet of Infallibility upon Earth had<lb/>
been sufficiently prevented by the <normalised orig="Heresiese" auto="false">Heresies</normalised>, of<lb/>

by Papias, who was Disciple of St. John,<lb/>
but (for ought I yet learn) without the<lb/>

and Pope Innocent the third,) and for six hundred<lb/>
years together, (if Maldonate the Jesuit<lb/>

to have been necessary to Infants, as well<lb/>
as to men of the ripest Age: and yet (as Maldonate<lb/>
<normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised> at the very same time,) it was so<lb/>
plain and so <normalised orig="grosse" auto="true">gross</normalised> and Error, that notwithstanding<lb/>

were 113. Bishops,) though not at all unto a<lb/>
Trans, but rather a Consubstantiation. Which<lb/>

Writers: Aquinas and Lyra do both confess<lb/>

                  <lb/>
For Priests were permitted to have wives, both<lb/>
in the Old and New Testament; (as Maximilian<lb/>
the Second did rightly urge against the Pope:)<lb/>
And the blessed Apostles (many of them) were<lb/>
married men: for so I gather from Eusebius out<lb/>
of Clemens Alexandrinus: and from the Letter<lb/>
of Maximilian, who did not want the Advice<lb/>
of the <normalised orig="learnedst" auto="true">learned</normalised> persons in all his Empire; and<lb/>
from 1 Cor. 9. 5. where St Paul asserts his liberty<lb/>
to carry a Wife along with him, as well as<lb/>
Gephas. And <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> the Doctrine of that Apostle,<lb/>
that a Bishop may be an Husband, although he<lb/>
may not be the Husband of more then one Wife.<lb/>
(1 Tim. 3. 2. Tit. 1. 6.) Besides, the Marriage of the<lb/>

8. I shall conclude with that Instance<lb/>
to which our Saviour in my Text does<lb/>
more peculiarly allude; I mean the Liberty<lb/>
of Divorce betwixt Man and Wife, for many<lb/>
more Causes then the Cause of Fornication. For<lb/>
so I find it is decreed by the Church of Rome,<lb/>
with an Anathema to all that shall contradict<lb/>
it. <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 19.8">But from the Beginning it was not so.</quote> For <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised><lb/>

more, then the opening of a way to rebel against <lb/>
him. For besides that in the Canon of<lb/>
the Council at Trent, a Divorce quoad<lb/>
ob multas Causas was decreed to be just in<lb/>
the Church of Rome, although our Lord had<lb/>
twice <normalised orig="confin'd" auto="true">confined</normalised> it to the Sole Cause of Fornication,<lb/>
(Matth. 5. 32. &amp; 19. 9.) And besides<lb/>
that the word Totun was constantly <normalised orig="reteined" auto="true">retained</normalised>.<lb/>
in four Editions, (particularly in That, which<lb/>
had the care and command of Pope Paul the<lb/>
Fifth,) Let it be granted that the council did<lb/>
mean no more, then a <normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> Sequestration from<lb/>

ever had,) it would be opposite (even so) to<lb/>
                  <pb n="34"/>
                  <lb/>
the Law of Christ. For he who <normalised orig="putteth" auto="true">puts</normalised> away his<lb/>

Nay, Chemnitius saith farther; That the<lb/>

he content himself to say, or affirm it only,<lb/>
but by a confluence of Scriptures does make it<lb/>
good, That against the Command of our<lb/>
blessed Saviour (in the verse but one before<lb/>
my Text,) That which God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="joyned" auto="true">joined</normalised> together,<lb/>
the men of Rome do put asunder. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
By these and many more Corruptions in <lb/>
point of Practice and Doctrine too, which<lb/>
were no more then Deviations from what had<lb/>
been from the Beginning, and which the<lb/>

We have the published Complaints of<lb/>

John of Hus, and Jerome of Prague,<lb/>
Chancellor Gerson, and Erasmus, and the Archbishop<lb/>
of Spalato. Ludovicus Vives, and <normalised orig="Cassander" auto="true">Cassandra</normalised>,<lb/>
who are known to have died in the same<lb/>
Communion, did yet impartially complain of some<lb/>
Corruptions. Vives of their Feasts at the<lb/>
Oratories of Martyrs, as being too much of kin<lb/>
unto the Gentiles Parentalia, which in the<lb/>
judgment of Tertullian made up a species of<lb/>
Idolatry. And <normalised orig="Cassander" auto="true">Cassandra</normalised> confesses plainly,<lb/>
that the Peoples Adoration paid to Images and<lb/>
Statues, was equal to the worst of the ancient<lb/>
Heathen. So the buying and selling of Papal<lb/>
Indulgences and Pardons (<normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> a little thing to<lb/>
say of Preferments too) was both <normalised orig="confest" auto="true">confessed</normalised> and<lb/>
<normalised orig="inveigh'd" auto="true">inveighed</normalised> against by Popish Bishops in Thuanus.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Now if with all their Corruptions in point of <lb/>
Practice, which alone cannot <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> a People's <lb/>
Separation from any Church, (though the Cathari<lb/>
and the Donatists were heretofore of that<lb/>
opinion,) we compare their Corruptions of<lb/>
Doctrine too, and that in matter of Faith, (as<lb/>

on Fundamentals; it will appear that That door<lb/>
which was <normalised orig="open'd" auto="true">opened</normalised> by us in our first Reformers, <lb/>
was not at all to introduce, but to let out Schism.<lb/>
For the schism must needs be Theirs who give<lb/>
the Cause of the Separation, not Theirs who<lb/>
do but separate when Cause is given. Else S. Paul<lb/>
had been to blame, in that he said to his Corinthians,<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 6.17">Come <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> out from among them, and be<lb/>
<normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> separate.</quote> (2 Cor. 6. 17.) The <normalised orig="actuall" auto="true">actual</normalised> Departure<lb/>
indeed was Ours, but Theirs the causal;<lb/>
(as our immortal Arch-Bishop does fitly<lb/>
word it.) we left them indeed when they<lb/>
thrust us out; (as they cannot but go whom<lb/>
the Devil drives;) But in propriety of speech,<lb/>
we left their Errors, rather then Them. Or if<lb/>
a Secession was made from them, <normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> in the<lb/>
very same measure that they had made one<lb/>
from Christ. (Whereas they, by their Hostilities<lb/>
and their Excommunications, departed properly<lb/>
from us, not from any Errors detected in us.<lb/>
And the <normalised orig="wo" auto="true">woe</normalised> is to <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 18.7">them by whom the offence <normalised orig="cometh" auto="true">comes</normalised></quote>, <lb/>
(Matth. 18. 7.) not to them to whom <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised><lb/>
given. If when England was in a Flame by<lb/>
Fire sent out of Italy, we did not <normalised orig="abstein" auto="false">abstain</normalised> from<lb/>
the quenching of it, until water might be drawn<lb/>
from the River Tiber; it was because our own<lb/>
Ocean, could not only do it sooner, but better<lb/>
too; that is to say (without a Figure,)<lb/>
                  <pb n="37"/>
                  <lb/>
It did appear by the Concession of the most<lb/>
learned Popish Writers, that particular Nations<lb/>
had still a power to purge themselves from<lb/>
their corruptions, as well in the Church, as in<lb/>
the State, without leave had from the See of <lb/>
Rome; and that <normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> commonly put in<lb/>
practice above a thousand years since. It did<lb/>
appear that the Kings of England (at least as<lb/>
much as those of Sicily,) were ever held to be<lb/>
                  NoValue and that by the Romanists themselves;<lb/>
until by gaining from Henry the First, the<lb/>
Investiture of Bishops; from Henry the Second,<lb/>
an Exemption of the Clergy from Secular Courts,<lb/>
and from <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> King John, an unworthy Submission<lb/>
to <normalised orig="forreign" auto="true">foreign</normalised> Power; the Popes became<lb/>
strong enough to call their strength the Law of<lb/>
Justice. And yet their <normalised orig="Incroachments" auto="true">Encroachments</normalised> were still<lb/>
<normalised orig="oppos'd" auto="true">opposed</normalised>, by the most pious and the most learned<lb/>
in every Age. Concerning which it were<lb/>

                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> to give a satisfactory account, if it were<lb/>
comely for a Sermon to exceed the limits of an<lb/>
hour. In a word, it did appear from the<lb/>
Code and Novels of Justinian, from the<lb/>
                  NoValue set out by the <normalised orig="Emperour" auto="true">Emperor</normalised> Zeno, from<lb/>
the practice of Charles the Great, (which<lb/>
may be judged by the Capitulars sent abroad<lb/>
in his Name,) from the designs and endeavours<lb/>
of two late Emperors, Ferdinand the First,<lb/>
and Maximilian the Second, from all the commended<lb/>
Kings of Judah, from the most pious<lb/>
Christian <normalised orig="Emperours" auto="true">Emperors</normalised> as far as from Constantine <lb/>
the Great, and from many Kings of<lb/>
England in Popish times too; that the work of<lb/>
Reformation <normalised orig="belong'd" auto="true">belonged</normalised> especially to them in<lb/>
their several Kingdoms. And this is certain;<lb/>
that neither Prescription on the Pope's side, nor<lb/>
Discontinuance on the Kings, could add a Right<lb/>
unto the one, or any way lessen it in the other.<lb/>
For it implies a contradiction, that what is<lb/>
wrong should grow right, by being prosperous<lb/>
for a longer or shorter season.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Had the Pope been contented with his<lb/>
Primacy of Order, and not ambitiously affected<lb/>
                  <pb n="39"/>
                  <lb/>
a Supremacy of Power, and over all other<lb/>
Churches besides his own; we never had cast<lb/>
off a Yoke which had never been put upon our<lb/>
Necks: And so <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> plain that the Usurper did<lb/>
make the Schism. If Sacrilege anywhere, or<lb/>
Rebellion, did help reform Superstition; That<lb/>
was the Fault of the Reformers, not at all of<lb/>
the Reformation; nor of all Reformers neither.<lb/>
For the most that was done by some, was to<lb/>
write after the Copy which had been set them<lb/>
in my Text, by the Blessed Reformer of all<lb/>
the World; which was so to reform, as not to<lb/>
innovate, and to accommodate their Religion<lb/>
to what they found in the Beginning.<lb/>
Nay, if I may speak an Important Truth,<lb/>
(which being unpassionately <normalised orig="consider'd" auto="true">considered</normalised>, and<lb/>
universally laid to heart, might possibly<lb/>
tend to the Peace of Christendom;) seeing it<lb/>
was not so much the Church as the Court of<lb/>
Rome, which proudly trod upon Crowns and<lb/>
Scepters, and made Decrees with a non obstante<lb/>
to Apostolical Constitutions, or whatsoever<lb/>
had been enacted by any Authority whatsoever,<lb/>
(the Commandments of Christ being not excepted;)<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="36">F 2</fw>
                  <pb n="40"/>
                  <lb/>
we originally departed with higher Degrees<lb/>
of Indignation, from the Insolent Court, then<lb/>
Church of Rome. Nor protested we so much<lb/>
against the Church, (though against the<lb/>
Church too,) as against the Cruel Edict first<lb/>
made at Worms, and after cruelly reinforced<lb/>
at Spire and Ratisbone, for the confirming of<lb/>
those Corruptions from which the Church<lb/>
was to be <normalised orig="cleans'd" auto="true">cleansed</normalised>. To the former we <normalised orig="declar'd" auto="true">declared</normalised><lb/>
a Vatinian Hatred; but to the latter of the<lb/>
two, we have the Charity to wish for a Reconcilement. <lb/>
That we who differ upon the way<lb/>
in which we are walking towards Jerusalem,<lb/>
may so look back on the Beginning from<lb/>
whence at first we set out, (and from which<lb/>
our Accusers have <normalised orig="foulely" auto="true">foully</normalised> <normalised orig="swerv'd" auto="true">swerved</normalised>,) as to agree<lb/>
in our Arrival at the same Journey's end.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
But God forbid that our Love to the Peace<lb/>
without, should ever tempt us to a loss of the<lb/>
Peace within us. God forbid we should return<lb/>
with the Dog to his vomit, or with the Sow in the<lb/>
Hebrew Proverb (which is cited by S. Peter<lb/>
in his Epistle,) to her wallowing in the mire.<lb/>
When I wish for a Reconcilement, I do not<lb/>
mean by our Compliance with any the least of<lb/>
their Defilements, but by their Harmony with us<lb/>
in our being Clean.<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="37">36</fw>

On this Condition and Supposal; Our<lb/>
Church is open to receive the bitterest Enemies<lb/>
of our Church. Our Arms are open to embrace<lb/>
them, with Love, and Honour. Our Hearts<lb/>
and Souls are wide open in <normalised orig="servent" auto="true">servant</normalised> Prayers and<lb/>
Supplications to the God of Purity and of Peace,<lb/>
that (in his own good time) he will bind up<lb/>
the Breaches, and wipe off the stains, and raise<lb/>
up the lapsed Reputation, of his divided, defiled,<lb/>
disgraced Spouse; And all for the Glory, as well<lb/>
as Merits, of the ever blessed Bridegroom of all<lb/>
our Souls,<lb/>
To whom, with the Father, in the Unity of<lb/>
the Spirit, be ascribed by us, and by all the<lb/>

Blessing, and Glory, and Honour, and Power,<lb/>

forwards for evermore.<lb/>
