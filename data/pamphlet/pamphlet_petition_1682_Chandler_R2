Most gracious and dread <normalised orig="Soveraign" auto="true">Sovereign</normalised>, <lb/>
HAving made a most diligent inquiry <lb/>
into the state of the Church<lb/>
of God, militant upon Earth, I <lb/>
do find that it is not limited to <lb/>
any one Country or Nation, as the Donatists <lb/>
held; who fondly imagined the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> <lb/>

Jurisdiction, as the Roman <normalised orig="Catholicks" auto="true">Catholics</normalised> pretend, <lb/>

Damnation, who are not subject to their <lb/>

                  <lb/>
Bishop; vainly pretending to be truly <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> <lb/>
or Universal; as we do believe in our <lb/>
holy Creed. The Apostles preached not to <lb/>
one Country or Nation only, but to the <lb/>
whole World, according to our Lords Command; <lb/>
Go <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 28.19">teach all Nations, <normalised orig="baptizing" auto="true">baptising</normalised> them in <lb/>
the Name of the Father, and the Son, and <lb/>

                  <lb/>
I shall speak something of this persecuted <lb/>
Episcopal Church of England, whom the <lb/>
Lord, by his Providence, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> made Your <lb/>
Majesty Overseer: This Church, which was <lb/>
first planted by Joseph of Arimathea, some <lb/>
years before Rome, according to the purest <lb/>
way, as he had it from Christ and his Apostles, <lb/>
the great Bishop of our Souls; and so <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> continued a true Church, through <lb/>
much Persecution by the Heathen, and by <lb/>
the common Enemy the Papists, and by <lb/>
the Dissenters. As Gamaliel told the Jews; <lb/>
take heed, if it be of God <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> cannot overthrow <lb/>
it, lest you be fighters against God: <lb/>
No doubt this Church of England is of God, <lb/>
and cannot be overthrown. You have <lb/>
heard of the Persecution in Queen <normalised orig="Maries" auto="true">Mary's</normalised> <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
days, how she burnt twelve Bishops and <lb/>
Doctors, who sealed it with their Blood in <lb/>
the Fire, and Charles the First, who sealed <lb/>
it with his Royal Blood also; the Blood of <lb/>
the Martyrs is the Seed and Seal of a true <lb/>
Church. <lb/>
We most humbly thank Your Majesty, <lb/>
that Your Majesty <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> taken such care for <lb/>
this persecuted Church, which without doubt <lb/>
God prizes as the Apple of his Eye, in preserving <lb/>
it from all these Eminent dangers. <lb/>
And we most humbly thank Your Majesty, <lb/>
that Your most Royal Majesty <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
been pleased to put those good Laws in Execution, <lb/>
against those Enemies of the Church <lb/>
of England, that many of them have received <lb/>
Justice according to the merit of their Cause. <lb/>
The Lord bless Your Majesty, for taking such <lb/>
special care over both Church and State, <lb/>
for the good of us your unworthy Subjects, <lb/>
not doubting but Your Majesty will have <lb/>
the same care, so long as Breath shall remain <lb/>
in Your Royal Majesty, which the Lord of <lb/>
his Mercy grant for many Years to come, <lb/>
that we may receive the Benefit, and give <lb/>

God the Glory: And all this we beg for <lb/>

                  <lb/>
A word to his Royal Highness the Duke <lb/>
of York, under Grace and Favour. O Royal <lb/>
James! live for ever; Son to one of the best <lb/>
Kings that ever reigned; though David were <lb/>
a Man after Gods own Heart, and Solomon <lb/>
was a wise Man, yet Your Royal Father had <lb/>
less Errors than any of them. O Royal <lb/>
James, Heir to the Crown of England, after <lb/>
Your Royal Brothers Decease; as the case <lb/>
now stands, the Lord bless Your Lives with <lb/>
all blessings Spiritual and Temporal; and if <lb/>
ever Providence <normalised orig="ordereth" auto="true">orders</normalised> it so that You be <lb/>
Crowned King of England, and of the Dominions <lb/>
thereunto belonging, that you may <lb/>
come to it in peace, and not swim to it in <lb/>
Blood, for then it will prove to you a Curse, <lb/>
and not a Blessing. <lb/>
The Lord grant that you may maintain <lb/>
the true Government both in Church and <lb/>
State, as it now <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised>, as Your Royal Brother <lb/>
<normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> at this time, and your Royal Father <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(7)">(6)</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
of ever blessed memory <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> done, and <lb/>
as your Royal Grandfather King James <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
done; especially this Episcopal Church of <lb/>
England, which Your Royal Grandfather told <lb/>
Your Royal Father, he having studied to find <lb/>
the true Church of God, he was very well satisfied <lb/>
that the Church of England was the nearest to <lb/>
the Primitive Church planted by the Apostles. <lb/>
I shall add something more concerning <lb/>
the common Enemy the Papists, and Nonconformists. <lb/>
Our Saviour Christ saith, The time shall <lb/>
come, when they that kill you shall think <lb/>
they do God good Service: So did the Dissenters <lb/>
when they killed one of the best <lb/>
Kings that ever reigned; and so would the <lb/>
Papists, if they could have killed our King <lb/>
that now is; you see how they <normalised orig="tollerated" auto="true">tolerated</normalised> <lb/>
Murder, Treason, Perjury, and Rebellion; <lb/>
and he that could have killed Gods Vicegerent, <lb/>
should have done God good Service; <lb/>
yea, it was thought he should have <lb/>
been Sainted for his good Service: Yea, this <lb/>
temporal Man of Sin might as well have <lb/>
Sainted the Spiritual Man of Sin, the Devil, <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(8)">(7)</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
as to have Sainted these Priests and Jesuits, <lb/>
whom Satan had put into their Hearts <lb/>
to do his will; let this temporal Man of <lb/>
sin pretend what he will, yet this wicked Plot, <lb/>
to kill our <normalised orig="Soveraign" auto="true">Sovereign</normalised> Lord the King, came <lb/>
from the Devil, who is the original of all <lb/>
sin; for they reckoned to have sacrificed His <lb/>
Royal Body to God, for the Honour of <lb/>
their Church; when God tells them to obey <lb/>
is better than Sacrifice; that is, thou <lb/>
shalt do no Murder, and Rebellion is as <lb/>
the sin of Witchcraft.  <lb/>
Our Saviour Christ saith, I have chosen <lb/>
twelve, and one of them was a Devil; but <lb/>
what shall we call these Priests and Jesuits <lb/>
sent by the Man of sin, to kill Gods Vicegerent, <lb/>
the King? We may call them, as the <lb/>
Devil said their Name is, Legion, for they <lb/>
are many. Judas betrayed his Lord and <lb/>
Master for thirty pieces of Silver, but these <lb/>
Bloody Priests were to murder their Lord <lb/>
and Master for a bigger sum. Judas, when <lb/>
he had betrayed Christ, repented, and said, <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 27.4">I have sinned, in that I have betrayed innocent <lb/>
Blood</quote>; but these Men were so far from repenting, <lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
that they would not confess upon <lb/>
their <normalised orig="Tryal" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, though it were proved by two <lb/>
of the Kings Witnesses. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
You see then, Judas, for all he was counted <lb/>
a Devil, yet <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> more of a Christian <lb/>
in repenting, and in laying down his Money <lb/>
again, than those Jesuitical Devils, which <lb/>
would not confess the Fact of their Devilish <lb/>
Designs, though it was proved against them. <lb/>
The Wise Man saith; He that <normalised orig="covereth" auto="true">covers</normalised> his <lb/>
Sin shall not prosper, but he that <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised> and <lb/>
<normalised orig="forsaketh" auto="true">forsakes</normalised> his Sin shall find Mercy: Yea, when <lb/>
the Man of Sin heard of the good success <lb/>
of this wicked Plot going on so well, the <lb/>
Conclave of Hell sang te Deum, and the Man <lb/>
of Sin gave them his Blessing; you see for <lb/>
all they sung to God for Joy, and the Man <lb/>
of Sin gave them his Blessing; their <normalised orig="myrth" auto="true">mirth</normalised> <lb/>
was turned into sadness, and their blessing <lb/>
into a Curse upon them, as <normalised orig="TYBURN" auto="false">TIBORN</normalised> will <lb/>
witness, and many Spectators that beheld <lb/>
them. O my Beloved, take special notice, <lb/>
that this Plot was not from God, but of <lb/>
themselves, with the help of Satan, and came <lb/>
                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>
to nothing, as Gamaliel saith: I beseech you <lb/>
all good People that fear God, to take special <lb/>
notice of the Death of Sir Edmundbury <lb/>
Godfrey, which discovers more of inhumanity <lb/>
in their Religion, than any other of their <lb/>
wicked devices; if all the Devils in Hell had <lb/>
been let loose to their assistance, they could <lb/>
not have done more than these wicked Men <lb/>
did; they enticed him with flattering and <lb/>
lying words; as St. Paul saith; they told him <lb/>
if he would go along with them, they would <lb/>
<normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> him more of that wicked Conclave; and <lb/>
he being a Justice of the Peace, he might <lb/>
apprehend them: this honest Justice being <lb/>
willing to serve the King, according to his <lb/>
Oath, went with them, and they had him into <lb/>
a place, where they secured him from the <lb/>
help of all his Friends; there, as I may say, <lb/>
they opened Hell Gates, and let out the Devils, <lb/>
who fell upon him, and wickedly murdered <lb/>
him, he being without any comfort, <lb/>
but the mercy of Christ Jesus upon his <lb/>
Soul. <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(11)">(10)</fw>

O all you <normalised orig="Emperours" auto="true">Emperors</normalised>, Kings, Princes, and <lb/>
Dukes, whom God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> ordained as his Vicegerents <lb/>
to execute his will upon Earth, take care <lb/>
you come not near the man of Sin, nor adhere <lb/>
to his deceivable bloody Doctrine, who <lb/>
allows his Priests to colour their Coats with <lb/>
the blood of Kings and Princes, and to wash <lb/>
their Altars with the blood of Gods Saints, <lb/>
and garnish their Sepulchres with the blood <lb/>
of Gods Elect; as our Saviour saith; and <lb/>
will not God avenge the blood of his Elect, <lb/>
that cry to him day and night? yea, he will <lb/>
avenge them speedily. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
You see this Scripture fulfilled quickly after <lb/>
the death of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey,  <lb/>
how God did avenge his Blood upon his <lb/>
Murderers, witness <normalised orig="TYBURN" auto="false">TIBORN</normalised>, and many <lb/>
that beheld them. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
All the Massacres, both in France, and other <lb/>
places, the Chronicles speak of, in murdering <lb/>
many hundred of poor innocent Protestants, <lb/>
was done by that bloody Church <lb/>
of Rome. <lb/>

All you <normalised orig="Emperours" auto="true">Emperors</normalised>, Kings, and Dukes, <lb/>
whom God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> ordered to execute his <lb/>
Will upon Earth, have a care that you do <lb/>
not oblige your selves to the Man of sin, <lb/>
by swearing Allegiance, or Canonical obedience; <lb/>
for then he makes you under the <lb/>
Man of Sin and Satan, his Vassals and Slaves, <lb/>
that when he calls his Councils, you must <lb/>
agree to his unlawful Decrees, which if you <lb/>
do not, he will put you into the state of <lb/>
Damnation, as he <normalised orig="thinketh" auto="true">thinks</normalised>.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
We see how this Church of England <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>

witness the twelve Doctors and Bishops <lb/>
in Queen <normalised orig="Maries" auto="true">Mary's</normalised> days, who sealed it by <lb/>
Blood and Fire; and Charles the First, of ever <lb/>
blessed memory, sealed it with his Royal <lb/>
Blood also, who without doubt is now a <lb/>
Saint in Heaven; which except we could expect <lb/>
a better place of happiness than ever was <lb/>

Jesus Christ, who <normalised orig="dyed" auto="true">died</normalised> for the <normalised orig="Priviledge" auto="true">Privilege</normalised> of this <lb/>

will their poor Subjects love their Royal Majesty <lb/>
above measure, in taking such care of this <lb/>
true Church of God, wherein contains all our <lb/>
happiness, both of Soul and Body; then will <lb/>
God love us, when we love him and his Vicegerent; <lb/>
for God is Love, and in him is no hatred; <lb/>
then will he dwell in us, and we in him, <lb/>
then will God bless us with blessings both temporal <lb/>

both of Soul and Body, consists. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
The honour of a King is to have the love of <lb/>

Subjects, but a Godly and a pious King; which <lb/>
the Lord grant to us such a measure of grace, <lb/>

One thing more I shall not forget to put His <lb/>
Majesties Subjects in mind of, That if ever <lb/>
His Majesty should call a Parliament, that they <lb/>
<normalised orig="chuse" auto="true">choose</normalised> no Dissenters; for if God do not bless <lb/>
them to agree in matters of Religion, he will <lb/>
not bless them when they come to sit upon matters <lb/>
of State. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
In the Fifth of the Galatians, it is said, <quote type="biblical" ana="Gal 5.19-21">The <lb/>
Works of the Flesh are these, Adultery, Fornication, <lb/>
Uncleanness, Lasciviousness, Witchcraft, Hatred, <lb/>
Variance, Emulation, Wrath, Strife, <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised>, <lb/>
Sedition, Envying, Murder, Drunkenness,</quote> which do <lb/>
appear to be some of the sins of the Church of <lb/>
Rome; and that they that do such things shall <lb/>
not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven: <quote type="biblical" ana="Gal 5.22-23">But the <lb/>

A word in answer to the Presbyterians, whom <lb/>
a Person of our Neighbourhood told me, that <lb/>
they did attest they had no hand in the <lb/>
Death of King Charles the First: Which I <lb/>
wish from my Heart that it were true, which I <lb/>
fear is not, because the Scots sold him for certain <lb/>
hundreds of thousand pounds; because <lb/>
that blessed King <normalised orig="spake" auto="true">spoke</normalised> in his little Book, called <lb/>
his Meditation, that he was sorry he was sold for <lb/>
more than his Saviour. Without doubt they <lb/>
sold him to the other Dissenters, which at last <lb/>
Crucified him. If it were a sin in Judas for selling <lb/>
and betraying of his Lord and Master, I <lb/>
fear it was a sin in them for betraying and selling <lb/>
of their Lord and Master the King. Judas <lb/>
had some remorse in him, and seemed to repent <lb/>
in, throwing down the Money, and saying, <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 27.4">I have sinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent <lb/>
Blood</quote>; and so I hope will these repent from the <lb/>
bottom of their Hearts, that their Souls may <lb/>
be saved in the day of the Lord; the which I <lb/>
beseech the Lord Jesus Christ to grant unto <lb/>
them through his Grace and Mercy, and that <lb/>
they may return to us again from whence they <lb/>
went out; and that they may renounce that <lb/>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
wicked Covenant, if they have taken it; that <lb/>
they together with us, and we with them, may <lb/>
serve God together in love, that this Church <lb/>
militant may fit us for the Church triumphant, <lb/>
where we may all meet together to sing Halilujah <lb/>
to the great God that reigns for ever; where <lb/>
there is no division nor <normalised orig="dissention" auto="true">dissension</normalised>, but all love <lb/>
and unity, which the Lord of his Mercy grant. <lb/>
