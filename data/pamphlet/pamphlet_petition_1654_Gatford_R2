THE MOST HONOURABLE <lb/>

Most Honourable, and <lb/>
truly honoured, <lb/>
BE pleased (I most humbly beseech you) <lb/>
to receive by the hands of another, <lb/>
what my present infirmities of body, <lb/>
and poverty of condition, will not <lb/>
permit me to present unto your Honours by mine <lb/>
own. The following Petition, and certain Quæres <lb/>
annexed thereto; both occasioned by the late <lb/>
Ordinance for the ejecting of scandalous, ignorant, <lb/>
and insufficient Ministers and School-masters. <lb/>
An Ordinance deserving your strictest examination, <lb/>
as being suggested to his <normalised orig="Highnesse" auto="true">Highness</normalised> <lb/>
by some grand, but close underminers of the <lb/>
Protestant Religion, for the utter extirpation of <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Ministery" auto="true">Ministry</normalised> thereof out of this Nation, and <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
therefore already taken (as I am informed) into <lb/>
your most pious consideration, as a work most beseeming <lb/>
you and your known zeal and affection to <lb/>
the said Religion. And if the said Petition, and <lb/>
Quæres may contribute ought, though never so little, <lb/>
to that great and glorious work, I shall give <lb/>
God all the glory of it; as I shall never cease to <lb/>
supplicate him for his assisting you therein, and <lb/>
crowning your endeavours with an happy and <lb/>
honourable <normalised orig="successe" auto="true">success</normalised>. I have caused both the Petition <lb/>
and Quæres to be Printed, and taken the best <lb/>
order I could, at this distance with the Stationer, <lb/>
to whose care I committed the Printing of them, <lb/>
that your <choice ana="typeset-error">

selves in your retirements, as well as <normalised orig="joyntly" auto="true">jointly</normalised> in <lb/>
your Assembly (if you see cause) peruse and <lb/>
scan every part and clause thereof. And if after <lb/>
such a perusal, your Honours shall <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> (as I <lb/>
trust you will) nothing therein either repugnant <lb/>
or prejudicial to truth, and the zealous and prudential <lb/>
propugning thereof, or unbeseeming the <lb/>
propugner, or unworthy of your Honours appearing <lb/>
for; I humbly <normalised orig="begge" auto="true">beg</normalised> your further recommending <lb/>
them (if you shall think fit) to a <lb/>
more <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> view, either of his <normalised orig="Highnesse" auto="true">Highness</normalised> or <lb/>

                  <lb/>
any other, with what advantage your better <lb/>
Judgements, and more inflamed zeal to Gods <lb/>
glory, and the true Reformed Religion shall <lb/>
prompt you to. But if they obtain no other <normalised orig="favor" auto="true">favour</normalised> <lb/>
but the being read by you, I shall repute it no small <lb/>
<normalised orig="recompence" auto="true">recompense</normalised>, as well as honour to have such <lb/>
witnesses of my being really studious, and cordially <lb/>
desirous to defend and maintain, to the <lb/>
utmost of my weak power and ability, the said <lb/>
true Reformed Protestant Religion established in <lb/>
the Church of England, against all the enemies <lb/>
and oppugners thereof; as also against whatsoever <lb/>
<normalised orig="scandalls" auto="true">scandals</normalised>, reproaches, or aspersions they <lb/>
can cast on it. And that as readily and willingly <lb/>
now in these times of frenzy and <normalised orig="madnesse" auto="true">madness</normalised> on the <lb/>
one hand, as heretofore in those of imprudence <lb/>
and incogitancy on the other. And perhaps the <lb/>
known adversaries of our Religion (whose <lb/>
heads have been and still are very <normalised orig="busie" auto="true">busy</normalised> in all <lb/>
the designs and contrivances against it, though <lb/>
they have and <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> make use of others hands to <lb/>
act by) may lose a great part of their present <normalised orig="designe" auto="true">design</normalised>, <lb/>
if they be not wholly frustrated, by this <lb/>
single appearance of one poor stripling of the <lb/>
Church of England; it being known to them <lb/>
and to the world, that (notwithstanding the fall <lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
of so many thousand able and eminent professors <lb/>
and repugners of the same Religion, by their <lb/>
Jesuitical treacheries and conspiracies) there <lb/>
are yet whole Armies left of the same faith and <lb/>
courage, though they have not so <normalised orig="publiquely" auto="true">publicly</normalised> <lb/>
declared themselves, nor indeed might without <lb/>
incurring some censure, which they are desirous <lb/>
to avoid. Howsoever, if that stripling be but <lb/>
encouraged with your approbation (as he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
reason from former mercies and deliverances to <lb/>
hope for Gods assistance) he shall willingly hazard <lb/>
himself in the defence of his Religion; <lb/>
and, upon reasonable warning, will be ready <lb/>
with his Shepherds Scrip, and Pastoral Instruments, <lb/>
(though he be <normalised orig="sequestred" auto="true">sequestered</normalised> from his flock) <lb/>
to encounter with any Philistine, to whom your <lb/>
Honours shall send or call forth. <lb/>

An Ordinance for the ejecting of Scandalous, <lb/>

of Perjury, Adultery, Fornication, <lb/>
<normalised orig="Drunkennesse" auto="true">Drunkenness</normalised>, and other abominable <lb/>

thoroughly Orthodox or faithfully laborious, <lb/>
how devoutly pious, and eminently religious <lb/>

<normalised orig="craveth" auto="true">craves</normalised> leave to offer these few particulars <lb/>
to your most serious and pious consideration. <lb/>
First, <normalised orig="Wether" auto="true">Whether</normalised> the joining of the Book of <lb/>
Common-Prayer, and Ale-houses in their suppressing, <lb/>
and the reputing and accounting <lb/>
the <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> reading or using it amongst <lb/>
such horrid crimes before mentioned, and <lb/>
the adjudging him that so <normalised orig="readeth" auto="true">reads</normalised> or <normalised orig="useth" auto="true">uses</normalised> <lb/>
it, to be therefore so scandalous, as to deserve <lb/>
to be ejected out of his Cure or Charge, <lb/>
be not (to say the least of it) very injurious <lb/>
and prejudicial to the true Reformed Protestant <lb/>
Religion it self, and highly <normalised orig="dishonorable" auto="true">dishonourable</normalised> <lb/>
both to it and to the true Professors <lb/>
thereof, as also much <normalised orig="advantagious" auto="true">advantageous</normalised> to the <lb/>
enemies of both, as well in their now more <lb/>
then ordinarily endeavoured, and more <lb/>
then wontedly prevailing seducements and <lb/>
temptations, for the perverting and corrupting <lb/>
many weak brethren, as otherwise, when <lb/>
it cannot be <normalised orig="denyed" auto="true">denied</normalised>, but that the said Book <lb/>
was at first composed by most pious, and religious, <lb/>
as well as Learned and Orthodox<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">(a)</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
men, eminent for their <normalised orig="wisdome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised> and prudence <lb/>
in assisting the Reformation of Religion, <lb/>
and renowned for their fidelity and <lb/>
constancy in sealing their profession with <lb/>
their <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>: And <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been since revised, <lb/>
and farther approved and established by all <lb/>
our pious Protestant Princes, with the advice <lb/>
and consent of their most Judicious and <lb/>
Religious Parliaments; And contains in it <lb/>
the form and matter of the <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> worship <lb/>
of God by Prayer, and the form and <lb/>
manner of the <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> dispensing the holy <lb/>
Sacraments, and other necessary <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> <lb/>
observances, constantly practised and observed <lb/>
by the Protestants here in England, ever <lb/>
since the Reformation, and no ways repugnant <lb/>
in any essential part thereof to the <lb/>
<normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> form of Prayer, and Administration <lb/>
of the Sacraments, used in other Reformed <lb/>
Churches: So that, if that way and <lb/>
manner of the <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> worship of God by <lb/>
Prayer, and of the <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> dispensing or <lb/>
<normalised orig="administring" auto="true">administering</normalised> the Sacraments, which <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="bin" auto="true">been</normalised> <lb/>
the only constant and approved way here <lb/>
in the Church of England, be such as deserves <lb/>
not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> utterly to be abolished and suppressed, <lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
but to be joined in the abolishing <lb/>
and suppressing it, with those sinks of sin, <lb/>
and nurseries of vice, common Ale-houses, <lb/>
and to have the using that way and manner <lb/>
reputed amongst such horrid crimes as by <lb/>
the said Ordinance ‘<normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> reputed, and to be <lb/>
adjudged so scandalous, as that they who <lb/>
use it ought to be deemed and censured as <lb/>
unfit &amp; unworthy to officiate in the Church; <lb/>
and for that cause alone to be ejected and <lb/>
displaced: It will thereupon easily be inferred <lb/>
and concluded, that the Church of <lb/>
England (the acknowledged Bulwark and <lb/>
<normalised orig="Fortresse" auto="true">Fortress</normalised>, as well as asyle and refuge of all <lb/>
the Protestants in <normalised orig="Christendome" auto="true">Christendom</normalised>) <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> hitherto <lb/>
foully and <normalised orig="grosly" auto="true">grossly</normalised>, yea, criminously <lb/>
and scandalously erred in two main Fundamentals <lb/>
of Religion, and discriminating <lb/>
notes of a true Church, viz. the true worshipping <lb/>
of God, and the right and lawful <lb/>
administration of the Sacraments. And whether <lb/>
the granting or supposing this, be not <lb/>
very injurious and prejudicial to the true <lb/>
Reformed Protestant Religion it self, and <lb/>
highly dishonourable both to it and to the <lb/>
true Professors thereof, &amp;c. as is before <normalised orig="alledged" auto="true">alleged</normalised>, <lb/>
                  <lb/>

                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
is humbly submitted to your Judgements. <lb/>
Secondly, for the vindicating of the true <lb/>
Reformed Protestant Religion, and the <lb/>
professors thereof, from this foul, but most <lb/>
unjust scandal and aspersion, and from the <lb/>
injury, prejudice and <normalised orig="dammage" auto="true">damage</normalised>, that it and <lb/>
they may suffer thereby; Your humble Petitioner <lb/>
further <normalised orig="prayeth" auto="true">prays</normalised>, that his <normalised orig="Highnesse" auto="true">Highness</normalised> <lb/>
the Lord Protector, may be so fairly and <lb/>
observantly treated with, and advised by <lb/>
your Honours, his now greatest Council, <lb/>
concerning that particular, that without <lb/>
the least reflection of diminution upon his <lb/>
Honour and <normalised orig="Wisdome" auto="true">Wisdom</normalised>, (so far as is possible) <lb/>
his own opinion, or rather sudden <lb/>
conception upon others suggestions, concerning <lb/>
the Book of Common-Prayer, may <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> <lb/>
taken off, &amp; changed into better thoughts; <lb/>
and so the honour of that Book (so far at <lb/>
least, as concerns the honour of God, himself, <lb/>
and the true Reformed Protestant Religion) <lb/>
be preserved, which is no more then <lb/>
the Apostles themselves did in the abolishing <lb/>
of Jewish Rites and Ceremonies, how <lb/>
inconsistent <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised> with the Christian Profession, <lb/>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
and practise, and may much more <lb/>
be indulged to the reverend and religious <lb/>
worship of many thousands and ten thousands <lb/>
eminently renowned Christians. <lb/>
And for the same ends, your Petitioner <lb/>
in the third place, <normalised orig="offereth" auto="true">offers</normalised> to your <normalised orig="Honors" auto="true">Honours</normalised> <lb/>
this humble motion and earnest supplication, <lb/>
That you would be pleased (with the <lb/>
consent of his <normalised orig="Highnesse" auto="true">Highness</normalised> first obtained) to <lb/>
publish a decree or command, That all persons <lb/>
of what religion or profession <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised>, <lb/>
that have ought to object or except against <lb/>
set forms of <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> Prayer, and administration <lb/>
of the Sacraments in general, or against <lb/>
the Book of Common-Prayer in particular, <lb/>
do (by some few of their own religion <lb/>
and profession, chosen by them for that purpose, <lb/>
for the avoidng of tumults and confusion) <lb/>
within such a time give in to your <lb/>
Honours, either written or printed, all or <lb/>
the chief of the reasons &amp; grounds of those <lb/>
their objections and exceptions. And that <lb/>
your Petitioner, (though very weak and unworthy <lb/>
to appear in so great a cause) together <lb/>
with some few other of those many <lb/>
that are of his judgement, may, upon sufficient <lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
notice thereof given to them, and some  <lb/>
small charges, by reason of his and their <lb/>
known poverty, allowed them, be admitted <lb/>
to return answer to those objections and <lb/>
exceptions; and then have some further time <lb/>
assigned them to clear and make good to <lb/>
his <normalised orig="Highnesse" auto="true">Highness</normalised> and to your Honours, these <lb/>
three Assertions. <lb/>
I. That Set Forms of <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> Prayer, <lb/>
and dispensing of the Sacraments, are more <lb/>
agreeable to and consistent with the precepts <lb/>
and rules of Prayer, and dispensing the <lb/>
Sacraments contained in sacred Scripture, <lb/>
then ex tempore Prayers and Arbitrary modes <lb/>
of dispensing these Ordinances are. <lb/>
II. That it is requisite and necessary for <lb/>
every settled Church in every Nation to <lb/>
have (as anciently and lately they had) <lb/>
known Set-Forms both of <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> Prayers, <lb/>
and of <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> dispensation of the <lb/>
Sacraments, that so errors in both may be <lb/>
the better avoided, and the uncharitable <lb/>
judging of each other prevented, and peace <lb/>
and truth preserved. <lb/>
III. That the Book of Common-Prayer, <lb/>
and administration of the Sacraments formerly <lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
established and used here in England, <lb/>
is absolutely the best Form and freest from <lb/>
all just exceptions in all <normalised orig="essentiall" auto="true">essential</normalised> points <lb/>
and practises of Religion, that ever yet saw <lb/>
light in the Christian world, and none of <lb/>
the weakest Forts, that the Church of England <lb/>
had against Popery, and other errors, <lb/>
and heresies. And therefore may by your <lb/>
Honours mediation to his <normalised orig="Highnesse" auto="true">Highness</normalised>, and <lb/>
with his and your joint approbation and <lb/>
confirmation, be still continued in this <lb/>
Church (at least in those Congregations <lb/>
that shall accept and desire it) without the <lb/>
scandal of any, or prejudice to those that <lb/>
shall use it. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
And for this your justice, and zeal for the <lb/>
honour of God, and the true Reformed <lb/>
Protestant Religion, your Petitioner <lb/>
with many thousands shall <lb/>
faithfully and devoutly pray, &amp;c. <lb/>
