A<lb/>
SERMON,<lb/>
PREACHED<lb/>
At the opening the Wednesday Lecture in<lb/>
All-Saints Church in Maldon.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
Acts, Chap. 24. Verse 14.<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Acts 24.14">But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which<lb/>
they call <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised>, so worship I the God of my <lb/>
Fathers</quote>.<lb/>
IN the way to my Text, I judge it a reasonable tribute of <lb/>
our gratitude to our Diocesan, to observe, how those blessed<lb/>
Effects, and Influences of his paternal care and watchfulness,<lb/>
which are conspicuous in all places of his Jurisdiction,<lb/>
are in the most sensible manner made apparent to you,<lb/>
the Inhabitants of this remote, and almost forgotten corner of <lb/>
the Kingdom; and that in the occasion of our present meeting,<lb/>
wherein you have restored to you a most laudable Privilege,<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="2">B</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
which you have long wanted, your Weekly Lecture:<lb/>
In which you must needs acknowledge your engagements to<lb/>
your Bishop, who <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> made himself a debtor to many Brethren<lb/>
for your sakes: Nor is the Benefaction its self more worthy of <lb/>
your Gratitude, than the piety of his Lordships intention in this<lb/>
Lecture, may be commanding of your Thankfulness: Our Bishops<lb/>
Hopes and Counsels, and Prayers are, not only that you<lb/>
may have the gracious Arguments of Virtue, Patience, Righteousness,<lb/>
and <normalised orig="Holyness" auto="true">Holiness</normalised>, without which, <quote type="biblical" ana="Heb 12.14">No Man shall see the <lb/>
Lord</quote>, unfolded, and recommended to your Practice in the most<lb/>
<normalised orig="perswasive" auto="true">persuasive</normalised> Applications: but also, that you may continue in all<lb/>
soundness of Doctrine, and become armed against the arts, and<lb/>
surprises of false Teachers, who do either obtrude their own Traditions,<lb/>
for the Commandments of God, or attempt to withdraw<lb/>
the Affections of Men from our most excellent Church<lb/>
by false and unwarrantable misinterpretations of her Doctrines.<lb/>
I say our most Excellent Church, which is loaded by Rome, with<lb/>
the imputations of <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised>, because the endeavours to <normalised orig="shrowd" auto="true">shroud</normalised><lb/>
her Members from the taint of Rome's Defilements: And has<lb/>
been reviled by another sort of mistaken Christians, as being<lb/>
her self Popish, because she labours to preserve the Holy Services<lb/>
of God clean, from the <normalised orig="unhallow'd" auto="true">unhallowed</normalised> violence of Man's Profaneness:<lb/>
Now there cannot be a greater Service done to the Church<lb/>
of Christ, than when his precious Depositum is kept unviolated,<lb/>
or to the <choice ana="illegible">

                     <corr>Edification</corr>

                  </choice>) intention in this Lecture<lb/>
which I am to open, I have made choice of this passage of<lb/>
St. Paul, who here answers the impeachment of the Jews, who<lb/>
had centured his Labours in Christ, his professing, and propagating<lb/>
the Christian Religion, (just as our Adversaries of the Church<lb/>
of Rome do all our holy Ministrations, and Services in the support<lb/>
of the Faith, and truth of the Blessed Jesus) as a work of<lb/>
<normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised>, with this Confession, <quote type="biblical" ana="Acts 24.14">But this I confess unto thee, that<lb/>
                     <pb n="2"/>
                     <lb/>
after the way that they call <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised>, so worship I the God of my<lb/>
Fathers.</quote> That which I shall endeavour at present, shall be the <lb/>
vindication of the Doctrines and Measures of our Church, as<lb/>
to some Matters of her Faith and Practice, which are quarrelled<lb/>
at by our Roman Adversaries; which, in the most insolent Pomp.<lb/>
and disdain, are exploded by them as Spots, and Deformities in<lb/>
our Reformation. First, then, That wherewith they think<lb/>
they shake us most, is this, that we are of a new Religion,<lb/>
a novel and up-start Church, not able to make out a continuance<lb/>
for two of sixteen Centuries.<lb/>
This I take to be the most gainful plea of the Crafts-men<lb/>
of their Diana, that by which she most fatally allures many<lb/>
into the Labyrinth of her Delusions: Certainly as to her Doctrines,<lb/>
the <normalised orig="Monstresities" auto="false">Monstrosities</normalised> of Transubstantiation, Purgatory, of <lb/>
the Sacrifice of the Mass, and Prayers in a strange Language;<lb/>
these can have no appearances so beautiful and tempting, as to<lb/>
prove Charming in themselves, and captivate our Souls <normalised orig="englighten'd" auto="false">englightened</normalised><lb/>
by the wisdom of the Gospel: But when they are told they embrace<lb/>
a new Religion, a Religion not heard of in the Christian<lb/>
World till these last two Hundred Years; this may possibly startle<lb/>
ignorant Men, and justly requires our Consideration: In answering<lb/>
therefore this Objection, I doubt not to expose the vanity,<lb/>
and disappoint the impressions of such light pretences, and<lb/>
manifest them to be no other but Noise and Cant. First, Then,<lb/>
if by a new Church, they mean a Church introducing a new<lb/>
Scheme of Faith and Belief; methinks that main part of old<lb/>
essential Verities, wherein they and we agree, together with <lb/>
our explicit belief of all the known Doctrines of the Scriptures, <lb/>
and our implicit belief of all things therein contained, may in <lb/>
great measure declare the Antiquity of ours; especially since we<lb/>
retain all that Faith, and religiously adhere to all those Creeds,<lb/>
which the third General Council held at Ephesus, adjudged to <lb/>
be so material and comprehensive, as positively to forbid the <lb/>
imposition or addition of any other, if that was the Old Faith<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="4">B2</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
which was professed by the Primitive Fathers of that Council,<lb/>
how can ours now be denominated a new one, who have neither<lb/>
diminished nor added to the Articles of their Belief? The<lb/>
Creeds confirmed, and authorized in that Council, were that of<lb/>
the Apostles, and that of Nice, and therefore methinks the<lb/>
Faith founded on them may with some face pretend to Antiquity.<lb/>
Again, if by a new Church, they mean a National Church<lb/>
of but late Strength and Establishment; we deny not the present<lb/>
Church of England to be a new Church in such a sense; but<lb/>
then we answer withal, that such a new Church may be said,<lb/>
without a Paradox, to contain as Old a Religion as the ancientest<lb/>
foundation of Christ, though not for the Age of its Establishment,<lb/>
yet for the Antiquity of its Truths and Doctrines,<lb/>
which only (properly speaking) can Entitle any National Church<lb/>
a part of the ancient Church of Christ: And this is the highest<lb/>
mark of Antiquity our Church pretends to assume, that<lb/>
she now professes that very Faith which our Saviour taught, <lb/>
which his Holy Apostles <normalised orig="profess'd" auto="true">professed</normalised>, and propagated in the first<lb/>
Ages of Christianity. And let Men pretend what they will,<lb/>
the only Demonstration and Test of any particular Churches<lb/>
Antiquity (as it is a true or a corrupted part of the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised><lb/>
Church of Christ) must be the Antiquity of her Doctrines and<lb/>
Principles, by reason as no Christian Church can be ancienter<lb/>
than Christ, the Author and Finisher of our Faith: So again, <lb/>
no particular Church, professing his ancient Faith and Truths,<lb/>
can be said to introduce, or embrace a Religion younger than<lb/>
that of Christ, because it then professes that very truth of <lb/>
Christ, which has been professed by his Faithful in all Ages: <lb/>
So that though the Church of England may be later than the <lb/>
Church of Rome, in such respects as these; either, because<lb/>
our Conversion to the Faith might possibly have been after<lb/>
theirs; or again, because our particular establishment, as it <lb/>
now stands, was enacted many Ages since the first settlement<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="5">4</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
of a Christian Church at Rome: Yet our Religion now, may be<lb/>
ancienter still, than their's at present; if they are now changed, <lb/>
and degenerated (as <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> demonstrable they are) from that<lb/>
Christian Purity, which anciently denominated them an uncorrupted<lb/>
part of the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church; and we now faithfully<lb/>
adhere with all Uprigthness and Integrity (which we are ready<lb/>
to make appear we do) to that Faith of Christ which was once<lb/>
delivered to the Saints; and as by many other Churches, so<lb/>
anciently <normalised orig="maintain'd" auto="true">maintained</normalised> by the Church at Rome: For, as their new<lb/>
corruptions, and additional definitions of Faith must fall short<lb/>
of those Ages wherein Christianity flourished with all Truth<lb/>
and Purity; and those can be no other than the Days of <lb/>
Christ, and his Apostles; so the old truths retained and professed<lb/>
by us, must have been then most triumphant and prevailing.<lb/>
And therefore that which has puzzled so many weak<lb/>
and unlearned People of our Communion, to wit, the question<lb/>
about the Age of our Religion, and our Church, may easily<lb/>
be resolved if they distinguish the Antiquity of Seat and Place<lb/>
(which is nothing to the business) from the Antiquity of Truths<lb/>
and Doctrines; and this distinction must be allowed good even<lb/>
by our Adversaries themselves, if they consider, that the dispute<lb/>
now is not about the Antiquity of particular Sees and <lb/>
national Constitutions, but the Antiquity of Faith and Religion<lb/>
its self, which I hope may be the same in a Church of Yesterday's<lb/>
Conversion, as it was in Antioch, which had the honour<lb/>
to give the first Name to Christians.<lb/>
Did the Church of Rome at any time esteem her own Antiquity<lb/>
lessened, upon such a Consideration as this, that St. Peter<lb/>
erected his Apostolical Seat first at Antioch, before ever he<lb/>
had arrived at Rome? Or will she acknowledge a deference due<lb/>
to that Church in point of Faith and Purity, because she had<lb/>
the happiness to be Christened before her? I doubt the Mother<lb/>
and Mistress of all Churches, as she delights to stile her<lb/>
self, <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> never stoop to such a Condescension: If my Faith<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="6">5</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
be found, and perfect now, can it be believed the more new,<lb/>
and up-start, because not professed by my Fore-fathers, who knew<lb/>
not the Truths? Or does my late Conversion if good and upright<lb/>
diminish, or derogate from the Antiquity of Truth its <lb/>
self? The Antiquity of all other things is calculated from their<lb/>
Original, and beginning in the World, and why the same<lb/>
rule won't do in Faith and Religion I understand not. Indeed,<lb/>
if any particular Church <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> make out a <normalised orig="continu'd" auto="true">continued</normalised> Succession<lb/>
in all circumstances of Doctrine and Discipline, from the times<lb/>
of the Apostles, unto this very day, this <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> no doubt be<lb/>
an incomparable Argument both of her Antiquity, and of<lb/>
God's especial Goodness and Providence over her: But the<lb/>
present Roman Church can no more make out such a Succession<lb/>
than the present Church of England; and if she <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised>, still<lb/>
such a Succession is not to be <normalised orig="esteem'd" auto="true">esteemed</normalised> the only mark of Truth<lb/>
and Antiquity: And this I think cannot be more clearly illustrated<lb/>
than from Matter of Fact, to which, we may appeal<lb/>
in this case; for instance, there can be no Question, but the<lb/>
ancient Faith of Christ is now professed by the true Faithful of <lb/>
Christ, and shall continue to be so professed till the Day of Judgment;<lb/>
and yet there is now no particular Church of the Faithful<lb/>
that can make out such a Succession, nor any one Church<lb/>
endowed with an assurance of continuing indefectibly in that<lb/>
very State in which she is now, till the Day of Judgment.<lb/>
I know the Church of Rome <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> fain have us believe her<lb/>
inspired with these infallible Accomplishments, but she must<lb/>
produce a better Scheme of her Perfections, than what we <lb/>
meet in her Trent Definitions; or she will never <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> us, <lb/>
that she is any more like the Church <normalised orig="Establish'd" auto="true">Established</normalised> at Rome by <lb/>
St. Peter, than St. Peter himself was like the most changed<lb/>
and <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>b*cksliding</sic>
                     <corr>backsliding</corr>
                  </choice> Apostle: For as to her Magnificent Stile in<lb/>
writing her self the Church <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised>, this must appear rather<lb/>
a Character of Ornament and <normalised orig="Shew" auto="true">Show</normalised>, than any certain signification<lb/>
of her necessary continuance in Truth and Purity. For,<lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
were not the <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised> Sees as liable to relapse, and degenerate, <lb/>
as any founded by their Successors? Where is the glory<lb/>
of Antioch, Ephesus, and Alexandria, which the Apostles themselves<lb/>
planted and watered with the Dew of Heaven, which<lb/>
those Heavenly Shepherds <normalised orig="nourish'd" auto="true">nourished</normalised> with the blessed Food of <lb/>
Evangelical Righteousness? And notwithstanding all the applauses<lb/>
with which the present Romanists exalt themselves; I <lb/>
doubt not, but were St. Peter to arise this moment from the <lb/>
Dead, and visit the Conclave, or inspect the Councils of Rome,<lb/>
but he <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> be very much put to it, where to find Faith on <lb/>
Earth. <lb/>
I say therefore, her being founded by an Apostle (if we grant<lb/>
thus much) can no more Entitle her indefectible in the Faith, <lb/>
than it has the Churches of Antioch, Ephesus, and Alexandria, <lb/>
which have either altogether failed, and forsaken the Name of <lb/>
Christ; or are (at least according to their own Roman <normalised orig="Tenents" auto="true">Tenants</normalised>)<lb/>
quite cut off for Schism or <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised> from the Communion of<lb/>
what they call the true Church; let her <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> when, and<lb/>
where, God has anointed her with this <normalised orig="Oyl" auto="true">Oil</normalised> of Perfection above<lb/>
her Fellows: But now then, if an <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised> Church may thus<lb/>
recoil, and become impure, (nay, since Christianity shall<lb/>
not fail) why must not some Churches be most pure, which<lb/>
yet are not Apostolical, I mean taught and instructed by the<lb/>
lively voice of the Apostles? If this be <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> arguing, what may<lb/>
we think of all the Churches Converted, and founded many<lb/>
Ages since the days of the Apostles? Or, if this be a good Inference,<lb/>
what Objection can it be against any particular Church<lb/>
which is found, and upright in all her Doctrines, that she has<lb/>
not continued for ever, that she is yet but of a very late Birth<lb/>
and Duration? If her Doctrines are as Old as the Scriptures,<lb/>
can the Religion of such a Church fall short of the Age of the<lb/>
Gospel? If her holy Principles flourished in the ancientest Creeds<lb/>
and Councils, can she reasonably be <normalised orig="Reproach'd" auto="true">Reproached</normalised> for an Innovation<lb/>
of Two Hundred Years ago? This is the very case of<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="8">7</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
the Church of England, and for the truth of it, we appeal to<lb/>
the Scriptures, to the ancientest Creeds, and Councils. Indeed,<lb/>
the Church of Rome makes a great noise and show with the flourish<lb/>
of her Succession; but if she means a Succession in purity<lb/>
of Doctrines, we may easily convince her of Vanity and Tattle;<lb/>
if she means a Succession in the outward circumstances, and appearances<lb/>
of a Church, such as consists in true Pastors, Bishops,<lb/>
and the like; I answer, that there may be such a visible<lb/>
Succession, and yet that Church that enjoys it in many respects may<lb/>
be very corrupt and unwarrantable; and this I think is sufficiently<lb/>
<normalised orig="acknowledg'd" auto="true">acknowledged</normalised> by the Church of Rome her self, which does<lb/>
so far acknowledge the Succession of the Greek Church, as to<lb/>
receive those Ordained by her, into her Communion, with allowance<lb/>
of Orders received before; and yet whoever considers<lb/>
the terms in which the Eastern Church now stands, with<lb/>
that at Rome, must see little reason to conclude much of its<lb/>
Perfection, from the Argument of Succession; indeed, there<lb/>
cannot be a true Church without true Pastors and Bishops, but<lb/>
there may be true Pastors and Bishops, i.e. Pastors, and Bishops<lb/>
rightly called, and truly ordained, without a true Church in other<lb/>
respects: Such Succession will indeed prove the Antiquity<lb/>
of the Seat and Place, and justly denominate it a part of the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church of Christ; but it can be no convincing Demonstration<lb/>
of the purity of its Faith and Doctrines: And therefore<lb/>
it must follow, that, even from an erroneous Church, may<lb/>
be derived a true <normalised orig="Ministery" auto="true">Ministry</normalised> and Ordination; but, yet it can be<lb/>
no greater Argument, that such a particular Church, namely,<lb/>
as the Church of Rome, is a pure Church now, because an other,<lb/>
to wit the Church of England, who is really so, owes her<lb/>
Orders or first Episcopal imposition to hers; than it can be, that<lb/>
because such a particular Man, for his own personal Virtue and<lb/>
Integrity, shall certainly go to Heaven, therefore he also shall do<lb/>
so, who made him a Christian: And this I the gladlier mention,<lb/>
because it plainly answers that <normalised orig="Sophistical" auto="true">Sophisticated</normalised> Induction of the Romanists,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="9">8</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
which infer that, because we say our Church derives<lb/>
her Orders from her; therefore by proving our selves to be a<lb/>
true Church, we must necessarily conclude their's to be so,<lb/>
which is the same, as if a Man in declaring his Opinion of<lb/>
their being Orthodox in some points and particulars, <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> be<lb/>
concluded positively to maintain them to be most regular in all<lb/>
others. A more rational Inference from what has been said in<lb/>
this case of Succession, must certainly be this, that such a Local<lb/>
Succession of Pastors, and a settled Establishment from the days<lb/>
of the Apostles to this time, is not essential to the constitution<lb/>
of a true Church; but rather on the other side, whatever<lb/>
Church <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a lawful Ministry, and a right Profession of found<lb/>
Doctrine (let her Succession be never so inconsiderable, though<lb/>
not exceeding two years) must have an equal Right and Title<lb/>
to a Membership in the ancient Body of Christ, as any particular<lb/>
Church of the most <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>v*nerable</sic>
                     <corr>venerable</corr>
                  </choice> Succession: And the reason<lb/>
of the thing is very plain, for, if a Church has a true Ministry,<lb/>
and a right belief, now what signifies it how long she has <normalised orig="enjoy'd" auto="true">enjoyed</normalised><lb/>
it; she can then want no means to bring Souls to Heaven,<lb/>
and what advantage can the ancientest Constitution in the<lb/>
World obtain above her: The Seat where the Religion is fixed<lb/>
may be new, but the Religion <normalised orig="Establish'd" auto="true">Established</normalised>, as Old as Truth it<lb/>
self: And thus I hope the Churches which were the earliest<lb/>
planted in the World, were as true Churches the first day after<lb/>
their Plantation, as when they had survived various Centuries:<lb/>
So that it must be impertinent in our Adversaries to require us<lb/>
to produce a Succession of Protestant Bishops, so long as there<lb/>
<normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> be no reason any Bishops <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> be called Protestant; i.e.<lb/>
Such Bishops, who protest against Innovations and Corruptions<lb/>
in the Religion of Christ, till they had defiled God's heavenly<lb/>
Truths with their Traditionary Pollutions; or again, so long as<lb/>
we prove our <choice ana="illegible">

they are Corruptions introduced by them, which we disavow,<lb/>
and protest against: Let them prove us defective in any one<lb/>
essential point of a true Church, and we will yet thankfully receive<lb/>
it, but this their own fruitless endeavour towards it, may<lb/>
evince they cannot, and therefore to talk of Novelty and Innovations,<lb/>
where the Truths are as ancient as the Gospel, and<lb/>
the Apostles, must argue great Folly in them that urge it, but<lb/>
more inconsideration in us <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> we regard it. As we are able<lb/>
to <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> our cause from all their foulest Imputations, so shall<lb/>
they never be able to prove our Religion a Novelty, though<lb/>
its Establishment were but of Queen Elizabeth; for it is the<lb/>

                  </choice> of true Faith only, that we contend for, which can<lb/>
never be obscured by the latest Profession, because what was<lb/>
truth in the Apostles time must be so now; and that Church,<lb/>
which cleaves <normalised orig="stedfastly" auto="true">steadfastly</normalised> to that, (be its Succession never so<lb/>
late) must be both <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> and <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised> in the purest<lb/>
meaning.<lb/>
After all this stir of Novelty and Antiquity, I see no other<lb/>
difference in our case, and that of the Romanists but this, that<lb/>
our Religion is apparently conspicuous in the best and most<lb/>
Apostolical Centuries; and their's manifest enough in the flourishing<lb/>
Days of Ignorance and Superstition, when Scriptures<lb/>
were banished, and the least appearance of such Truth, as seemed<lb/>
to thwart the progress of an aspiring Monarchy, was silenced<lb/>
and disabled: That which seems so much to take with inconsiderate <lb/>
Men, to wit, such Queries as this, Had not God his<lb/>
true Church in these days of Blindness and Ignorance, which<lb/>
you Protestants allude to, if so, Then which <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> be this true<lb/>
Church, but that at Rome, may easily be removed if they observe<lb/>
First, That a local and visible Establishment, such as<lb/>
can be pointed to (though we have many such to refer to in<lb/>
the Eastern parts of Christendom, even in the blindest Ages,<lb/>
besides that at Rome) is not essential to the proving of a true<lb/>
Church, because the true Church of Christ was most illustrious<lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
before it had enjoyed any Local Establishment whatever. Secondly,<lb/>
If we consider, that though there were in those times<lb/>
true Christians, yet it cannot be imagined that they <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> have<lb/>
<normalised orig="appear'd" auto="true">appeared</normalised> forward to make Discoveries of themselves, in such<lb/>
Seasons, when they <normalised orig="experienc'd" auto="true">experienced</normalised> the sharpest Eyes and heaviest<lb/>
Hands ready to destroy them: So that though we must believe<lb/>
God had always a true Church, yet we stand not <choice ana="illegible">

                     <corr>necessitated</corr>

                  <lb/>
directly to know what numerical and individual People made<lb/>
up that true Church, much less to confess it to have been the<lb/>
present Establishment at Rome; no, we can no more be <normalised orig="oblig'd" auto="true">obliged</normalised><lb/>
to such a Confession as this, than to acknowledge, that the visible<lb/>
company of the Jews made up the true Church of God:<lb/>
than, when they were even <normalised orig="swallow'd" auto="true">swallowed</normalised> up of Idolatry, and<lb/>
none but the All-seeing Eye of God able to discover the 7000<lb/>
Knees which had never bowed to Baal; it is no Tergiversation<lb/>
therefore; it is no Shuffling, I say (though we can't point to it's<lb/>
individual Members) to assert, That God had even then a true<lb/>
Church, because he has <normalised orig="expresly" auto="true">expressly</normalised> told us, he will have a true<lb/>
Church for ever; but it must be a most irrational consequence<lb/>
to conclude, that it was the Roman, when it was the Roman<lb/>
alone, from whence arose all those misty Tempests and Darkness,<lb/>
which had obscured the Truth, nay, which had most<lb/>
grievously then <normalised orig="oppress'd" auto="true">oppressed</normalised> and over-born her: If we are not<lb/>
now able to name who those good Christians were, that then<lb/>
made up the true Church; we may thank their Furnaces, Inquisitions,<lb/>
and Expurgatory <normalised orig="Subtilties" auto="true">Subtleties</normalised>, which affrighted them<lb/>
from the Light, and still took care to stifle the least occasions<lb/>
of their manifestations. We confess, God had always his<lb/>
true Church, and this is agreeable to his Word, but we acknowledge<lb/>
not that it was the Church of Rome, for this reason,<lb/>
because she was then, as she is now, most contradictory to<lb/>
the Truths of his Word.<lb/>
                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>
And thus I proceed to another Principle of our Church, impeached<lb/>
of <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised> by that of Rome, and that is our ways<lb/>
and methods of finding out the Truth: Now these are no other<lb/>
than what depend upon these two divine Principles, Scripture<lb/>
and Reason, which, as they are the immediate Gifts of God,<lb/>
flowing from the Excellency and Perfections of his own blessed<lb/>
Spirit, so methinks they may not improperly be <normalised orig="imploy'd" auto="true">employed</normalised> in<lb/>
his Divine Service: The Religious Man, in Scripture, is frequently<lb/>
                  <choice ana="print-error">

                  </choice> the Wife and the Understanding Man; and<lb/>
Wisdom, and Religion are generally used to denote one and<lb/>
the same thing, but how there can be the greatest Wisdom<lb/>
and Understanding where there must not be the least use or<lb/>
pretences to Reason, I leave to these Despisers of Reason to illustrate.<lb/>
The Wise Man tells us, A blind Sacrifice is an abomination<lb/>
to the Lord, and we often meet the Holy Ghost in the<lb/>
Scriptures, lashing at the Sacrifice of Fools, both which are <lb/>
demonstratively comprehended in that rebuke of our Saviour<lb/>
against the People of Samaria, saying, Te know not what <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised><lb/>
Worship; and now what can all these Passages suggest to us<lb/>
but this, that whosoever will pay a fit and suitable Worship<lb/>
to God, ought <normalised orig="throughly" auto="true">thoroughly</normalised> to know and understand the Nature<lb/>
and Excellency of the Divine Majesty, as far as he has been<lb/>
pleased to reveal himself; and then as one <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> think, nothing<lb/>
can more effectually instruct us in this Celestial Knowledge,<lb/>
than the very Writings and express Revelations of God<lb/>
himself; so it seems to me next door to a contradiction, for<lb/>
any Man to aver, that the most infallible way to come to a<lb/>
right Knowledge and Understanding of God, is to set aside<lb/>
our Reason, without which, <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> impossible to know or understand<lb/>
at all; or again, to renounce the Scriptures which<lb/>
are the only Books in the World, which his infallible Spirit<lb/>
has left us for our surer guidance and direction to that blessed<lb/>
Knowledge. <lb/>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
Perhaps, it may be suggested here, that the Mysteries and<lb/>
sublime Articles of our Religion, such as the Incarnation, the<lb/>
Trinity, and the Resurrection, which all infinitely transcend<lb/>
the highest Capacities of our Reason, depend not on the use<lb/>
of our Reason, but Faith, which is of those things which are<lb/>
invisible, even to the most piercing Eye of Man's Reason;<lb/>
so that we must leave our Reason in the way to our <normalised orig="embracements" auto="true">embraces</normalised><lb/>
of them, but this no way weakens the force of our<lb/>
Argument: For these Mysteries surpass indeed the comprehension<lb/>
of our Reason, yet the authority upon which we receive<lb/>
them into our Creed, lies open to our Reason, such as<lb/>
is the voice of the Scriptures, and the example of the purest<lb/>
Ages of the Church of Christ; which Reason recommends<lb/>
to us as the surest guides, to direct us in all Matters of Religion:<lb/>
And though indeed Reason cannot demonstrate to us<lb/>
the ineffable ways and explications of these Truths, yet Reason<lb/>
furnishes us with this Demonstration, that they ought to <lb/>
be received for the Truths of Christ; upon this account,<lb/>
because whatever is proposed to our belief upon such infallible<lb/>
Evidences as the Revelation of God's Word, and the uninterrupted<lb/>
Authority of his Primitive Church in all Ages, ought in <lb/>
reason to be believed as true.<lb/>
I acknowledge, were not these Articles of our Creed manifestly<lb/>
contained either in the express Words, or in the necessary<lb/>
conclusions of Scripture, or in the explications of the <lb/>
purest Ages of our Religion, the belief of them <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> be irrational,<lb/>
and these unwarrantably crowded upon the belief of a<lb/>
Christian: And therefore, even in those very Articles, which exceed<lb/>
our Reason, it is still Reason which must <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> our Faith:<lb/>
What, is our Reason given us for no other end, than to consult<lb/>
for the ease and satisfaction of our Bodies, or must that<lb/>
most sublime faculty of our Souls be no ways <choice ana="print-error">

                  <lb/>
or has he <normalised orig="express'd" auto="true">expressed</normalised> his intention to reach only the Learned<lb/>
and the Wise? Did not our Lord once make this the most<lb/>
expressive Argument, that the Messiah was come, viz. The<lb/>
poor have the Gospel Preached unto them? And must it not seem<lb/>
very strange, that Matters <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> be so inverted since he is<lb/>
gone, and this very Gospel left to us in Writing, that it is<lb/>
to be inspected now only by Doctors and Philosophers? Though<lb/>
the Poor have the Gospel still Preached unto them; yet the use<lb/>
of the Scriptures may well be <normalised orig="registred" auto="true">registered</normalised> to make up those defects<lb/>
and imperfections which our Preaching now abounds <lb/>
with, in respect of those more powerful and efficacious Institutions<lb/>
of Christ and his Apostles.<lb/>
I know none of us who are able to Convert Three Thousand<lb/>
with a Sermon; nor indeed, can we pretend to enforce<lb/>
any thing worthy of belief in you that hear us, but what<lb/>
we our selves fetch from that Fountain of heavenly Wisdom,<lb/>
which is the written Word of God: And then, why every<lb/>
Man may not as well Read, as hear the Gospel read to him;<lb/>
I leave to that blessed Spirit to determine, which <normalised orig="exhorteth" auto="true">exhorts</normalised> all<lb/>
Men to search the Scriptures. No doubt, as God has given<lb/>
us Reason to make us capable of Understanding, and Glorifying<lb/>
his Divine Majesty, so has he given us his Scriptures also, <lb/>
on purpose to exalt and englighten our Reason, and convince<lb/>
us all of the reasonableness of our Religious Services; and I<lb/>
confess, I see not how that Man can be able to pay his reasonable<lb/>
Service to God, who has taken up a belief in him<lb/>
without Reason; for let the Religion professed by such a Man<lb/>
be never so Holy and Pure, and true in its self, still in respect<lb/>
of such a Professor, this must be <normalised orig="own'd" auto="true">owned</normalised> rather to Chance and<lb/>
Fortune, than such a choice and wisdom as may affirm with <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Bless'd" auto="true">Blessed</normalised> Jesus, <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 4.22">We know what we Worship</quote>: For without Knowledge,<lb/>
there can be no Belief, and without Belief, no true<lb/>
coming unto God: But further, what reasonable Satisfaction<lb/>
can this be to any Man, to encourage him in his Perseverance<lb/>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
in his Religion in times of <normalised orig="Tryals" auto="true">Trials</normalised> and Temptations; to consider,<lb/>
he has taken up his Religion by Chance, and though<lb/>
he knows not why, yet still he is to be sure that he is in the<lb/>
right. <lb/>
But can any thing here touch the Proselytes of Rome, who, <lb/>
without troubling Scripture or Reason for the confirmations<lb/>
of their Evidence, tell us, they enjoy a far more infallible<lb/>
Rock, and certainty of their Faith, to wit, the Voice and<lb/>
Testimony of the Church. In truth, if we search into this<lb/>
Rock, it will appear no other than that Sandy Foundation,<lb/>
which was the choice of the foolish Builder: Let us reason the<lb/>
Case with some Roman Votary: Does thy Church, <normalised orig="sayest" auto="true">say</normalised> thou,<lb/>
tell thee thy Faith is true, then let me ask thee how thou<lb/>
<normalised orig="knowest" auto="true">know</normalised> that the Church which tells thee so is true her self;<lb/>
doest thou appeal to the Marks and Notes of a true Church,<lb/>
then I demand again, how dost thou know what peculiar<lb/>
Marks and Notes are the Marks and Notes of the true Church?<lb/>
Or again, how is it become certain to thee, that all these<lb/>
peculiar Marks and Notes do particularly fit and agree with<lb/>
thy particular Church in all respects? He that gets over these<lb/>
Questions without Scripture and Reason, must be Master of <lb/>
more than a Jesuitical flight and artifice; for this must be to<lb/>
judge of Notes without Judgment, to pronounce a conclusion<lb/>
without Premises; for where the conclusion is the result of <lb/>
Premises, there must needs be reasoning: Indeed, this can be <lb/>
no other, than to reply, Why she is true, because she is true:<lb/>
And yet I dare boldly affirm, they shall never be able to get<lb/>
further in the certainty of Faith, who shall first reject the<lb/>
Scriptures as to ambiguous and unintelligible; and then renounce<lb/>
their Reason as a thing dangerous, and reducing all to<lb/>
a private Spirit. But they are not brought to a stand yet,<lb/>
they have behind a glorious reserve, they will still tell us they<lb/>
have Councils and Fathers on their side; but to express the<lb/>
weakness of this hold, how many Volumes of <normalised orig="Learn'd" auto="true">Learned</normalised> Protestants<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="16">15</fw>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
are there extant, which remain so many monuments<lb/>
of the groundless vanity of their Plea from Fathers? and if<lb/>
the four first general Councils may be <normalised orig="allow'd" auto="true">allowed</normalised> worthy of the<lb/>
name of Councils, we <normalised orig="defie" auto="true">defy</normalised> the most Artificial Crafts men of <lb/>
them all to produce thence but one line which may appear<lb/>
serviceable to the cause of Popery.<lb/>
But to leave this Contest with the Learned, must it not be ridiculous<lb/>
in any unlearned Man to renounce the Scriptures, which were<lb/>
written on purpose for his Instruction in Religion, and which<lb/>
he may of himself be able both to read and understand, as to<lb/>
all matters of belief and practice, and betake himself to pleas<lb/>
from Fathers and Councils, when he is not able so much as<lb/>
to tell the Letters of that Language in which those Fathers and<lb/>
Councils were written, when he can be able to judge neither<lb/>
when those Fathers writ, nor yet what one Opinion they<lb/>
have left behind them: must there not be a much more rational <lb/>
satisfaction from such a plain Text of Scripture as this,<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 26.27">Drink <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> all of this</quote>, to invite us to receive the Cup, than a<lb/>

which the <normalised orig="unlearn'd" auto="true">unlearned</normalised> are able neither to disprove nor comprehend,<lb/>

that I can perceive between the two Churches here is this;<lb/>
The one, to wit, the Papist, Reasons from the Testimonies<lb/>
of fallible Men; but the other, namely, the Protestant, from <lb/>
the assurances of the infallible Dictates of God's Holy Spirit.<lb/>
That which here determines the Belief in both, is no doubt<lb/>
one and the same thing, viz. Man's private Judgment, which<lb/>
influences the one to believe so and so, and the other to believe<lb/>
thus and thus, because it appears most reasonable to<lb/>
them to believe so: And I appeal to any one of that Church,<lb/>
whether he <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> thus absolutely give up his Faith to the<lb/>
Church, did he not think he had great reason so to do; and<lb/>
then again, whether that Man which owns thus much, does<lb/>
not in great measure acknowledge himself a Judge of the<lb/>
Principles of his Religion; let them talk what they will,<lb/>
the Papist judges for himself as well as the Protestant; for<lb/>
if we are said to judge, when we declare to believe the<lb/>
Scriptures upon the authority of an Universal Tradition, may<lb/>
not they be said to judge, when they declare they believe<lb/>
in the Church, upon the single authority of her own<lb/>
assertion?<lb/>
If they please, they may deny what both they and we<lb/>
do practice; and indeed, what is not only undeniable, but<lb/>
what the very Voice and Commandment of God has <normalised orig="enjoyn'd" auto="true">enjoined</normalised><lb/>
us to perform; in one place, directing us to try all<lb/>
things, and hold fast that which is good; in another place,<lb/>
believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they<lb/>
be of God or no: Again, be <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> ready to render a reason<lb/>
of the hope that is in you, nay, lastly, we have the express<lb/>
approbation of our Saviour himself, telling us, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mk 7.14">If the <lb/>

I say again, these Texts must refer to the <normalised orig="tryals" auto="true">trials</normalised> of Religion,<lb/>
and therefore we may bid much good may do them<lb/>
with their implicit Faith, which is as much as to declare<lb/>
as to my Religion, I believe what I know not, and I know<lb/>
not what I must believe; which is to approve the Spirits<lb/>
without trying; and to conclude them to be of God, without<lb/>
so much as enquiring what kind of Spirits they are of <lb/>

Doctrines, which <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> impossible they <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> render a Reason<lb/>

of which he professes purely an implicit Belief, nay, perhaps<lb/>
which he understands not that he does believe, till the<lb/>

this is such a kind of Faith, which Christ himself detested to <lb/>
impose; for we may observe, that he never recommended any<lb/>
thing to the belief of the Jews, but what he still confirmed<lb/>
with such Tokens as might convince the meanest Spectators<lb/>
of its Truth; nay, we find he taught his Disciples many <lb/>

Faith, or such a groundless Belief as obliges us not only<lb/>
to abandon our Reason with all the strongest <choice ana="illegible">

of our Senses, but also to renounce the helps even of the <lb/>
inspired Writings of that blessed Comforter, which was<lb/>
sent on purpose to lead us into all Truth: Since Christ himself<lb/>
was pleased thus meekly to condescend in the giving <lb/>
satisfaction to our Infirmities, what kind of relation can that <lb/>
Church bear to him, which disdains a submission to an Examination,<lb/>
either by Reason, or the blessed Rule of God's<lb/>
own Word: I am sure it must be a shrewd sign, that that <lb/>
Church, which makes this refusal, is <normalised orig="reconcileable" auto="true">reconcilable</normalised> neither<lb/>
to Reason nor Scripture; for were she agreeable to either,<lb/>
why <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> she so imperiously decline a <normalised orig="tryal" auto="true">trial</normalised> by the two <lb/>
most Godlike Principles we are enriched with, which certainly<lb/>
Scripture and Reason may be acknowledged to be; neither<lb/>
can it be any great disgrace to the purest Church to <lb/>
be made appear conformable to them. I confess, I can't but<lb/>
admire the <normalised orig="subtilty" auto="true">subtlety</normalised> of the Church of Rome, in usurping<lb/>
thus an Authority above all Examination, since her Definitions<lb/>
of Faith are such, as far transcend the Explications either<lb/>
of Scripture or Reason, the clearest measures which God<lb/>
has left us to examine by: Is it not much the wisest way to <lb/>
put off such Commodities by the Gross, which we are satisfied<lb/>
won't bear a particular inspection? Is there not much<lb/>
greater security to such a Cause in an implicit Faith, which<lb/>
swallows down all at a lump, than such an explicit one as<lb/>
may be curious and inquisitive, and desire the satisfaction of <lb/>
Sense and Reason; I see no false step here on their Churches<lb/>

side, in point of Carnal Prudence and Worldly Policy, but<lb/>
methinks that must be an unintelligible Devotion indeed,<lb/>
which does thus contentedly ensnare his Soul for a Pig in a <lb/>
Poke, for what he is neither to scruple, nor yet to understand.<lb/>
And thus you see upon what contradictory and <normalised orig="irreconcileable" auto="true">irreconcilable</normalised> <lb/>
positions the Church of England and the Church<lb/>
of Rome are founded at present: that they are as far from<lb/>
one another as Scripture and no Scripture, Reason and no<lb/>
Reason, Antiquity and Innovations, Truth and <normalised orig="Falshoods" auto="true">Falsehoods</normalised>;<lb/>
and as the Churches stand at variance, so have the faithful<lb/>
Members of our Church upon all occasions and opportunities<lb/>
<normalised orig="appear'd" auto="true">appeared</normalised> in defiance of Rome's Corruptions; it is not<lb/>
many years since most of us beheld, and all of us heard<lb/>
with what steadiness and Devotion, with what Resignation<lb/>
to the will of God, and disdain to the pollutions of Men, <lb/>
the Members of our Church, like so many Illustrious Confessors<lb/>
withstood the attempts and <normalised orig="sollicitations" auto="true">solicitations</normalised>, the <normalised orig="threatnings" auto="true">threatenings</normalised><lb/>
and invitations of the <normalised orig="Whorish" auto="true">Whoorish</normalised> Woman: Withstood<lb/>
them, I say, even then, when many of the Members of our<lb/>
separate Congregations, who had before <normalised orig="shew'd" auto="true">showed</normalised> themselves<lb/>
most <normalised orig="uneasie" auto="true">uneasy</normalised> in their fears of Popery, gave life and boldness<lb/>
to her growing hopes, by their unseasonable Addresses<lb/>
and Compliances. I speak not this with a desire to make advantages<lb/>
of the weakness, or by way of insult over the <lb/>
inconstancy of our fellow Christians now in Charity.<lb/>
I <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> my self they were rather <normalised orig="outreach'd" auto="false">outreached</normalised> by the <lb/>
policies, than <normalised orig="debauch'd" auto="true">debauched</normalised> by the principles of Rome, and there<lb/>
is nothing we ought all more heartily to pray for, or more religiously<lb/>
endeavour than a mutual forgetfulness of all infirmities:<lb/>
but I speak it with hopes, that as such Protestants<lb/>
must acknowledge their error in siding with Popery then;<lb/>
so they will blush when they upbraid our Church as a <lb/>
Daughter of Babylon now: if Men <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> but credit their<lb/>
own eyes, or give place to the arguments presented to their<lb/>

own understandings, we need not appeal to other than our<lb/>
adversaries themselves, whether they can still believe our divine<lb/>
service to be (what some people do ignorantly miscall <lb/>
it) Popery in English, who remember the toleration and liberty<lb/>
given to every Soul, to run as far out of our Church<lb/>
and the found of its divine service as they pleased, managed<lb/>
by the artifice set on foot, and <normalised orig="carry'd" auto="true">carried</normalised> on by the influence<lb/>
of the Papists: if the way to Rome lies through a Communion <lb/>
with our Church as such Men dream, how come the Romanists<lb/>
(who are no strangers to their own interests) to seduce<lb/>
Men out of our Communion as the readiest road to<lb/>
Popery; had they seen with some <normalised orig="Mens" auto="true">Men's</normalised> eyes amongst us, and<lb/>
found any thing in our Communion which looks kind and<lb/>
serviceable to the cause of their own superstitions, <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> not<lb/>
to be believed they <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> so <normalised orig="publickly" auto="true">publicly</normalised> have tempted all Men<lb/>
out of our Communion, with the alluring promises of the<lb/>
royal favour; I take that liberty and toleration then given<lb/>
by the Papistry, to be so manifest an argument and declaration,<lb/>
of that opposition which our Church, in every particular <lb/>
of its constitution bears to Popery, which, as every eye<lb/>
might discern it, so every well-meaning Man ought to be<lb/>
convinced by it, and retract his censures. The Papists knew<lb/>
well enough there <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> be no enlarging their own, without<lb/>
first thining our Churches, that the Mass Book <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised><lb/>
make no advances, whilst the Common-Prayer stood in reputation;<lb/>
that the only probability they <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> have of making<lb/>
any Proselytes must be to get Men as far out of the<lb/>
bosom of our Church as possible.<lb/>
Methinks the pretences of some in separation from us, <choice ana="illegible">

reproach our service for Popish, and the practices of the Papists<lb/>
who were for drawing all Men out of our Communion<lb/>
as a bar to Popery, are very hard to be reconciled. The<lb/>
Conclusion from such considerations must be this, Either the<lb/>
Papists understand not what makes up the Popish Religion,<lb/>
                  <pb n="21"/>
                  <lb/>
or the divine service of our Church, which they appeared so<lb/>
eager to suppress and disgrace, can be no friend to Popery.<lb/>
No, be not deceived my Beloved, the infamous names and<lb/>
characters, such as <normalised orig="Schismaticks" auto="true">Schismatics</normalised>, <normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised>, and the like, which<lb/>
they fasten upon us, and wherewith they attempt to blacken<lb/>
the brightest services of all our holy ministrations; the continual<lb/>
succession of Plots, Stratagems, and Intrigues, which<lb/>
from Age to Age we have heard and seen formed by Papists<lb/>
against our holy <normalised orig="reform'd" auto="true">reformed</normalised> Church, from the very first appearance<lb/>
of its establishment, are and have been Arguments<lb/>
sufficient to convince all Generations, of the irreconcilable<lb/>
distance between the Doctrines of Rome, and the principles<lb/>
of the Church of England: It must be astonishing therefore<lb/>
to consider, what Sport and Pastime Rome makes of us after<lb/>
all: when she still so far intoxicates our heads by her<lb/>
snares of Division, wherewith she <normalised orig="lyes" auto="true">lies</normalised> in wait to deceive,<lb/>
and shatters all the foundations of our wisdom and understanding,<lb/>
by those winds of Doctrines which she has raised<lb/>
and let loose amongst us, that we turn the wrath and disaffection<lb/>
we profess to Popery, against that Church which<lb/>
has in so many, in such illustrious instances manifested her<lb/>
self the noblest <normalised orig="bulwork" auto="true">bulwark</normalised> against Popery, which we may<lb/>
with modesty express to be the only terror and envy of the<lb/>
Papists. Is not this the most formidable master-piece of<lb/>
those deluders, to work up a <normalised orig="profess'd" auto="true">professed</normalised> enemy to such a<lb/>
thoughtless zeal of indignation, as to make him fall foul upon<lb/>
his friends, and under the pretence of wounding his enemy,<lb/>
give the mortal stroke to his own strongest defence,<lb/>
which must be the accomplishment of all those (<normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> they<lb/>
ever have their end, which God forbid) who labour to overthrow<lb/>
the Church of England (whom Rome has ever treated<lb/>
as her most deadly foe) in order to the reforming Religion<lb/>
in such a manner wherein it may remain out of all danger<lb/>
of Popery; this is such an undertaking wherein I am<lb/>

The most weak and feeble Animals are seldom to be caught<lb/>
twice in the same <normalised orig="Ginns" auto="true">Gins</normalised>, neither will the silliest of Creatures<lb/>

common proverbial Observation among us, that even the<lb/>
burnt Child dreads the Fire? and shall we with our singed<lb/>
Fingers catch at those flames of Disunion, wherewith our<lb/>
Adversaries have so often reduced us to the most terrible Extremities,<lb/>
wherewith in the last Age they had well nigh consumed<lb/>
both us and our Religion? When we have so fatally<lb/>
smarted under the Sting and Poison, shall we still hug and<lb/>
cherish the Viper that breeds it? O no, let not us who really<lb/>
wish well to the true Israel of God, who have experienced,<lb/>
and must be abundantly sensible of the Uncleanness and<lb/>
Abominations lodged in the inworks of Babylon; let not us,<lb/>
I say, <normalised orig="fortifie" auto="true">fortify</normalised> her Walls by the works of our Hands, let us<lb/>
not protest against her Pollutions, and at the same time do<lb/>
the Drudgeries of her Tyranny; exclaim against her Superstitions,<lb/>
and pull down the Holy Temple of God's Truth,<lb/>
carry the name of Protestants and Reformists, and apply<lb/>
all our Parts, and Wisdom, and Counsels in the undermining<lb/>

his Brethren, and forgiving to his Enemies, more devoted to<lb/>
God, and inseparable from the Services of his Church, than<lb/>
