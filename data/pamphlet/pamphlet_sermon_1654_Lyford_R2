THese two things, The Truths of Christ, and<lb/>
Peace among Brethren, ought to be precious<lb/>
to every Son of the Church. <normalised orig="'Twas" auto="true">It was</normalised> a blessed<lb/>
time when the multitude of Believers were of<lb/>
one heart, and one <normalised orig="Soule" auto="true">Soul</normalised>, when they held Communion<lb/>
in Doctrine and Fellowship, in breaking<lb/>
of Bread and Prayers, they heard together, they received<lb/>
together, they prayed together; and according to this primitive<lb/>
<normalised orig="Patterne" auto="true">Pattern</normalised>, all good Christians should endeavour to walk,<lb/>
and those Churches are happy which hold that blessed knot of<lb/>
Truth and Love: Contrary whereunto are those two reigning<lb/>
evils among us at this day, viz. <normalised orig="Wantonnesse" auto="true">Wantonness</normalised> of Spirit, and Pride<lb/>
of Spirit; Through the <normalised orig="wantonnesse" auto="true">wantonness</normalised> of <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> spirits craving an<lb/>
absolute liberty in matters of God, the sacred Truths of God<lb/>
are corrupted and vilified; And through the Pride of <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised><lb/>
spirits on the other hand, imposing matters of Opinion and<lb/>
Worship under <normalised orig="temporall" auto="true">temporal</normalised> penalties, the Quiet of <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised><lb/>
Consciences, and Unity among Brethren is exceedingly disturbed<lb/>
and <normalised orig="unsetled" auto="true">unsettled</normalised>. There is much <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> in both <normalised orig="extreams" auto="true">extremes</normalised>, either<lb/>
that all things should be tolerated, or Nothing; that Nothing<lb/>
should be restrained, or that All things should be imposed, and<lb/>
rigidly enforced under <normalised orig="temporall" auto="true">temporal</normalised> inflictions; the one leads to<lb/>
<normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised> and <normalised orig="Atheisme" auto="true">Atheism</normalised>, the other to <choice ana="print-error">

my ensuing discourse, unto which ends I shall endeavour to<lb/>

thee o King, they serve not thy Gods, nor worship the Golden<lb/>

farther time for consultation; And whereas you threaten us<lb/>

is not worth the dying for. And if our God see cause by this<lb/>

In which Conference note two remarkable Acts,<lb/>
1. One of the King, <normalised orig="enjoyning" auto="true">enjoining</normalised> an Act of Worship upon men<lb/>
of a different judgement, and those, <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> Captives, under the<lb/>
sharpest <normalised orig="penaltie" auto="true">penalty</normalised>.<lb/>
2. The other of the poor vanquished Captives, their <normalised orig="refusall" auto="true">refusal</normalised>,<lb/>
<normalised orig="chusing" auto="true">choosing</normalised> rather to suffer, than to sin against God, resolving in<lb/>
the way of <normalised orig="Dutie" auto="true">Duty</normalised> to trust God with their lives, <notvariant>ver</notvariant>. 16,<lb/>
17, 18.<lb/>
Sundry particulars are observable, but I shall reduce the<lb/>
whole into 2. Doctrines.<lb/>
1. Though the <normalised orig="civill" auto="true">civil</normalised> power <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> much to do in matters of Religion,<lb/>
yet it may not <normalised orig="compell" auto="true">compel</normalised>, or enforce under <normalised orig="temporall" auto="true">temporal</normalised><lb/>
penalties to an Act of Worship, either in it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised>, or <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised><lb/>
in the judgement of him upon whom it is imposed: [Nebuchadnezzar <lb/>
sets up an Image, requires a Worship to it <choice ana="typeset-error">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr>under</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
pain of death: This was ill in him, and the like is ill in any man<lb/>
else.]<lb/>
D. 2. From their Answ. is this, To cleave to Gods will and ways<lb/>
against all humane dread and terror, out of a confident <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised><lb/>
that God is Lord of our lives, able to deliver, and in an<lb/>
humble resignation to his <normalised orig="wisdome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised> whether he will deliver or<lb/>
not in such a strait, is a strength of spirit to be endeavoured<lb/>
after by all that <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised> God and would keep a good conscience:<lb/>
Thus did these three men.<lb/>
I begin with the first Doctrine: Though the <normalised orig="Civill" auto="true">Civil</normalised> Power, &amp;c.<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
This Truth is evidenced by the Repentance of Nebuchadnezzar,<lb/>
v. 28. Blessed be God that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> changed the Kings word: By<lb/>
this Retraction he condemns his former <normalised orig="crueltie" auto="true">cruelty</normalised>. Note that<lb/>
passage of <normalised orig="Pauls" auto="true">Paul's</normalised> Repentance recorded, Acts 26. 11. <quote type="biblical" ana="Acts 26.11">I punished<lb/>
them oft in every Synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme</quote>:<lb/>
It was a great <normalised orig="weaknesse" auto="true">weakness</normalised> in them to blaspheme, but it was a<lb/>
great <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised> in Paul to <normalised orig="compell" auto="true">compel</normalised> them; and thus much<lb/>
S. Paul <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised>, that it is an Act of Persecution to<lb/>
<normalised orig="compell" auto="true">compel</normalised> poor Christians to deny what they believed concerning<lb/>
Jesus Christ. <lb/>
Obj. It may be said, S. Paul sinned because he compelled to that<lb/>
which was evil (as here Nebuchadn. did) else he needed not to repent<lb/>
of what he had done.<lb/>
Sol. 1. That which he did, was not <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> in the judgement of<lb/>
Authority; for verse 10. Saint Paul had a Commission so to do.<lb/>
2. Nor was it <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> in the judgement of his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> Conscience,<lb/>
for he verily thought, that he ought to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> many things against<lb/>
the name of Jesus, <notvariant>ver</notvariant>. 9. The <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> of his acting therefore<lb/>
did not lie only in the Object whereunto he compelled,<lb/>
but in the very act of compelling Christians to go against their<lb/>
<normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> Consciences.<lb/>
3. To put the <normalised orig="sinfulnesse" auto="true">sinfulness</normalised> of compelling upon the Object, is<lb/>
altogether unsatisfactory, for the question will still <normalised orig="recurre" auto="false">recur</normalised>, who<lb/>
shall judge of the right? Is not every Power judge of its <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised><lb/>
right? They that think it just to <normalised orig="compell" auto="true">compel</normalised> others to <normalised orig="yeild" auto="true">yield</normalised> to an<lb/>
unknown truth, or duty, will think it hard to be compelled to a<lb/>
like unknown duty by a contrary Power; And yet Error in Power,<lb/>
thinks it <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> as much right to a forcible imposition, as<lb/>
Truth <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> when it is in Power.<lb/>
Sol. 4. Note from this Confession of S. Paul two things,<lb/>
1. That an erring Conscience does not excuse in case of misactings;<lb/>
<normalised orig="Perswasion" auto="true">Persuasion</normalised> of Conscience is not the ground, nor<lb/>
prime rule of <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> actings, (for the Conscience it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> must<lb/>
be regulated, else it will be a false <normalised orig="witnesse" auto="true">witness</normalised> of God. As Conscience<lb/>
is set between God and us, so it must speak from God<lb/>
to us, not from Satan, or any Spirit delusion.) Saint Paul<lb/>
verily thought he ought to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> many things contrary to the <lb/>
Name of Jesus, yet was he not thereby excused; he did it not<lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
in malice, but his erring conscience put him upon that action,<lb/>
which was damnable.<lb/>
2. Note, that the plea of authority is not a sufficient discharge<lb/>
before God, for Paul had Commission for what <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised><lb/>
did. But he and his Commission were wicked, and I believe<lb/>
that many are and may be damned for their misactings, though<lb/>
they have authority for what they do, yea, though they be also<lb/>
in conscience <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> that they do nothing but what is good,<lb/>
as the <normalised orig="Jewes" auto="true">Jews</normalised> that crucified Christ, and they of whom Christ<lb/>
<normalised orig="speakes" auto="true">speaks</normalised> Joh. 13. 3. He that kills you, will <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> they do God good<lb/>
service: Paul had been damned for his persecuting, <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised><lb/>
had repented, though he did it ignorantly.<lb/>
Thus for the <normalised orig="proofe" auto="true">proof</normalised> in <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised>, There be two Branches of<lb/>
our Doctrine. 1. That the <normalised orig="Civill" auto="true">Civil</normalised> Magistrate may do much in<lb/>
matters of Religion. 2. Yet not this, viz. to impose under <normalised orig="temporall" auto="true">temporal</normalised><lb/>
penalties; There be two extremes, some <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> the Magistrate <lb/>
has nothing to do in matters of Religion; others, that<lb/>
he may do what <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> lift. Some <normalised orig="claime" auto="true">claim</normalised> an absolute <normalised orig="freedome" auto="true">freedom</normalised><lb/>
from all <normalised orig="Civill" auto="true">Civil</normalised> Power, as being for matter of Faith and Worship<lb/>
under Christ your King alone. Others challenge to the<lb/>
Magistrate a Power of imposing the <normalised orig="publikely" auto="true">publicly</normalised> owned and established<lb/>
Religion: The one is too loose, the other too rigid.<lb/>
The right or wrong apprehending and executing of this<lb/>
<normalised orig="practicall" auto="true">practical</normalised> point is of great good, or great <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised> to the<lb/>
Church of Christ: therefore for distinct proceeding, I shall<lb/>
endeavour to resolve these two Questions (1. What the <normalised orig="Civill" auto="true">Civil</normalised><lb/>
Magistrate has to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> in matters of Religion, (2. What he may<lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">

To the former, it is very much that the <normalised orig="Civill" auto="true">Civil</normalised> Magistrate <lb/>
may and ought to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> for Christ; for though the Magistrates<lb/>
be not Christs Officers of his Mediatory <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised>, as the Ministers<lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Gospell" auto="true">Gospel</normalised> are; The <normalised orig="Civill" auto="true">Civil</normalised> Power is a <normalised orig="Beame" auto="true">Beam</normalised> of Gods<lb/>

this Unction it is, that Magistrates are bound to serve<lb/>
Christ, as Magistrates, that is, use their <normalised orig="civill" auto="true">civil</normalised> power to serve<lb/>
Christs <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised>: The administration of <normalised orig="Civill" auto="true">Civil</normalised> Justice is not<lb/>
sufficient to give them the title of nursing Fathers (for so<lb/>
much the Turk at this day <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <normalised orig="yeild" auto="true">yield</normalised> them, and yet he is no<lb/>

used for the Churches <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> good. 1 Tim. 2. 2. The Object<lb/>

Paul <normalised orig="willeth" auto="true">wills</normalised> us to pray for Kings, and all that are in authority."<lb/>
Here's the quod sit, that the Magistrate may do much:<lb/>
how much that is, will <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> in these <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> Conclusions.<lb/>
1. For propagation of Religion and truth of Jesus Christ;<lb/>
It is his duty to take care that the <normalised orig="Gospell" auto="true">Gospel</normalised> be preached to all<lb/>
the people committed to his charge and governance, thus Jehosaphat <lb/>
sent Princes and Priests to teach in all the Cities of<lb/>
Judah. 2 Chron. 17. 8. 9. It is a most fond device to make a distinction<lb/>
between the Kings of Judah, and Christian Princes,<lb/>
for what the one did by virtue of their Office, the same, the<lb/>
other ought to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>, by virtue of the same Office, if there be no<lb/>
particular exception or limitation; God <normalised orig="enjoynes" auto="true">enjoins</normalised> our obedience<lb/>
to Christian Magistrates as well as unto them, Rom. 13. 1. <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 13.1">Let every <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> be subject</quote>, &amp;c. And the Scripture <normalised orig="enjoyning" auto="true">enjoining</normalised><lb/>
the duty of the subject, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> establish the authority of the Christian<lb/>
Magistrate (for they are Relatives.)<lb/>
2. For protection, and supporation: It is the Magistrates<lb/>
duty to protect Gods Truth, worship, and service in the exercise<lb/>
thereof against all violence and affronts. And for this purpose<lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
he is to take care for the maintenance and countenance<lb/>
of Ministers who are to give attendance to that <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised>, thus<lb/>
Hezekiah <normalised orig="spake" auto="true">spoke</normalised> comfortably unto all the Levits that taught<lb/>
the good knowledge of God. 2 Chron. 30. 22. He did also appoint<lb/>
the people to Minister sustenance unto them. 2 Chron. 31. <lb/>
4. He appointed his own portion. Moreover he commanded<lb/>
the people to give the portion of the Priests that they might<lb/>
be encouraged in the Law of the Lord, and they brought in<lb/>
abundance, the first fruits of <normalised orig="Corne" auto="true">Corn</normalised>, Wine and <normalised orig="Oile" auto="true">Oil</normalised>, and of all<lb/>
increase of the Field, and the tithe of all things brought they<lb/>
in abundantly. <normalised orig="Vers" auto="true">Verse</normalised>. 5. The like we read of good Nehemiah,<lb/>
Neh. 13. 10, 11, 12. See the place. <lb/>
3. For Reformation and Restraint of things which be destructive<lb/>
to what he is bound to <normalised orig="maintaine" auto="true">maintain</normalised> and propagate. And<lb/>
here the Magistrates duty is to <normalised orig="restraine" auto="true">restrain</normalised> <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> evils.<lb/>
1. The Practise of Idolatry, of this there can be little doubt:<lb/>
Jehosaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah were great Reformers, Josiah<lb/>
put down the Idolatrous Priests whom the Kings of Judah had<lb/>
set up to <normalised orig="burne" auto="true">burn</normalised> increase, &amp;c. (the like did Hezekiah. 2 Chro. 31.<lb/>
1.) yet Note by the way, that though those Priests which had<lb/>
served in the high places were degraded from doing the office<lb/>
of Priests at Gods Altar any more, yet they did <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> the Bread<lb/>
of their God among their Brethren, 2 Kin. 23. 9. And this was<lb/>
according to the Law. Levit. 21. <notvariant>Ver</notvariant>. 21, 22. <quote type="biblical" ana="Lev 21.21">No man that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised><lb/>

<normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> beg &amp;c. This I particularly observe, because though some of<lb/>
our Ministers might deserve to be put from their Office, as unfavory<lb/>
Salt, yet they must not be made vagabonds on the earth,<lb/>
nor their <normalised orig="Wifes" auto="true">Wives</normalised> and Children beggars: The Reformers under<lb/>
the N. Testament should follow the rule &amp; example of those reformers,<lb/>
in the O. Testament, and this is required of them, Eze.<lb/>
44. 11, 13, 14. At the purging of the new Churches <normalised orig="Ministery" auto="true">Ministry</normalised><lb/>
(there figured under Ezekiels Temple) those that had defiled<lb/>
themselves with false worship, were to be degraded from<lb/>
the dignity and office of a Priest, to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> the most servile and<lb/>
meanest offices about the Temple, yet they should have whereon<lb/>
                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>
to live and subsist: This I <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> and <normalised orig="presse" auto="true">press</normalised> the rather, because<lb/>
as there is a desire in some here present, that the <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised><lb/>
of Reformation should <normalised orig="proceede" auto="true">proceed</normalised> and be carried on in a way<lb/>
of <normalised orig="righteousnesse" auto="true">righteousness</normalised> and mercy, so there may be fulfilling<lb/>
of the same to roll away our (that I say not, your) reproach.<lb/>
A second thing to be restrained, is the <normalised orig="actuall" auto="true">actual</normalised> preaching and<lb/>
spreading of <normalised orig="hereticall" auto="true">heretical</normalised> and poisonous Doctrines: I lay <choice ana="illegible">

                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>
such dangerous opinions shall be published to the seducing<lb/>
and infecting of his people, then Christ will not have Jezebel,<lb/>
the pretended inspired <normalised orig="Prophetesse" auto="true">Prophetess</normalised>, nor any other of like condition,<lb/>
suffered to seduce his servants. Rev. 2. 14. It is <normalised orig="cleere" auto="true">clear</normalised>,<lb/>

                     <corr>restrained</corr>
                  </choice>, and in case such false Teachers disregard<lb/>
the censures of the Church, then the Magistrate is in this<lb/>
to serve Christ, and I <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> he may take those words of Paul<lb/>
for his warrant, Gal. 5. 12. Note 1. <normalised orig="Hee" auto="true">He</normalised> <normalised orig="speakes" auto="true">speaks</normalised> there of false<lb/>
Apostles who had poisoned that Church with some Jewish<lb/>
Doctrines. 2. He calls them troublers of the Church. 3. That<lb/>
such troublers ought to be cut off, else Paul would never have<lb/>
<normalised orig="wisht" auto="true">wished</normalised> it: I <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> not understand it of a cutting off of their Lives<lb/>
or Estates, but a restraint of their practice, that they might<lb/>
no longer trouble the Church with their pernicious Doctrines;<lb/>
And the restraint upon them must be so <normalised orig="effectuall" auto="true">effectual</normalised>, that they<lb/>
may be as if they were dead, for as long as they persist in their<lb/>
troublesome teaching, they are not cut off. 4. And when the<lb/>
Church has gon as far as it can, and <normalised orig="prevailes" auto="true">prevails</normalised> nothing, then<lb/>
<normalised orig="Pauls" auto="true">Paul's</normalised> wish calls for the Magistrates <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> to <normalised orig="restraine" auto="true">restrain</normalised> them, as<lb/>
<normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> workers in an high degree, and troublers of the Churches<lb/>
peace, which the Magistrate is bound to preserve. But that<lb/>
place, Zach. 13. 2, 3, 5. comes more home to our purpose, <quote type="biblical" ana="Zech 13.2">I<lb/>
will</quote> (saith the Lord) <quote type="biblical" ana="Zech 13.2-3">cause the Prophets and the <normalised orig="uncleane" auto="true">unclean</normalised><lb/>

                     <lb/>
in the Name of the Lord</quote>, &amp;c. This is a <normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised> prophecy of the<lb/>
times of the <normalised orig="Gospell" auto="true">Gospel</normalised>: wherein note, 1. That by the Spirit of<lb/>
God, there is foreshewed a singular <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> that should happen<lb/>
in the Christian Churches, viz. men shall <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised> themselves for<lb/>
Prophets which are none, (for they shall <normalised orig="weare" auto="true">wear</normalised> the Prophets<lb/>
garment to deceive.) 2. Those Prophets are Teachers of <normalised orig="falshood" auto="true">falsehood</normalised>.<lb/>
3. This <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> is to be purged away, and these men brought<lb/>
to shame by the Christian Magistrate: at the instance and<lb/>
complaint of their dearest friends, his Father and Mother shall<lb/>
thrust him through when he <normalised orig="prophecieth" auto="true">prophecies</normalised>, not with their own<lb/>
hands, but according to the Law, <normalised orig="Deut" auto="true">Deuteronomy</normalised>. 13. 9. They shall bring<lb/>
him to the Magistrate to be punished. 4. And this shall be the<lb/>
fruit of the Magistrate dealing with them, viz. they shall be<lb/>
ashamed of their vision, and their <normalised orig="prophecyings" auto="false">prophesying</normalised> <notvariant>Ver</notvariant>. 4. 5. and<lb/>
shall <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised>, I am no Prohpet, &amp;c. <lb/>
And there is a reason, as Mr. Burroughs thinks, why their best<lb/>
friends should withstand them in this their way. 1. Because it<lb/>
is abhorring to nature to suffer that God, whom wee honour,<lb/>
to be blasphemed. 2. And to see our Wives, Children and<lb/>
dearest friends to be seduced into <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised>, which wee <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> will<lb/>
<normalised orig="undoe" auto="true">undo</normalised> their <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised> to eternity, and not be able to <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> them;<lb/>
no way left to help our selves or them, <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> we can <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised><lb/>
the seducer to desist, or akse them why they do so, and <normalised orig="intreate" auto="true">entreat</normalised><lb/>
them to forbear.<lb/>
A third sort to be restrained are makers of Sects and Divisions<lb/>
among the people, because this is directly opposite to the<lb/>
Magistrates proper end, viz. <normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> Peace, and Quiet: The setting<lb/>
up of divisions, Church against Church, Ordinance against<lb/>
Ordinance, does in its <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> nature tend to the disturbance<lb/>
of <normalised orig="publik" auto="false">public</normalised> peace and humane society; See the danger of<lb/>
it, Gal. 5. 15. <quote type="biblical" ana="Gal 5.15">If <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> bite and devour one another, Take heed<lb/>
<normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> be not consumed one of another</quote>; if the Church of Christ<lb/>
which should be as a City at unity within it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, shall nourish<lb/>

                     <corr>Sects</corr>
                  </choice> and Divisions, there will be<lb/>
biting and devouring one of another, and the Churches divisions<lb/>
do prove the Churches consumptions.<lb/>
A fourth sort to be restrained by the Magistrate are vicious<lb/>
livers, to the <normalised orig="scandall" auto="true">scandal</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Gospell" auto="true">Gospel</normalised>: Though the loving<lb/>

                  <lb/>
of vice be worse than living in vice, yet the Magistrate cannot<lb/>
take notice of the affection, but of the action, to <normalised orig="restraine" auto="true">restrain</normalised><lb/>
open sins, yea, though they be not peace-disturbing enormities;<lb/>
For the Magistrates power is not limited to preservation of<lb/>
Peace and Justice <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, as its adequate Object, but is extended<lb/>
to other <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> <normalised orig="workes" auto="true">works</normalised> and open enormities: "As for example,<lb/>
he is to <normalised orig="restraine" auto="true">restrain</normalised> the polluting of the Sabbath by buying<lb/>

swearing comes within his compass, though the <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> peace<lb/>
be not thereby disturbed: It is very much, you see, that the <normalised orig="civill" auto="true">civil</normalised><lb/>
power has to do in the things of God. But against the<lb/>
Magistrates restraining power, 3. things are objected,<lb/>
1 <notvariant>Ob</notvariant>. May the Magistrate <normalised orig="restraine" auto="true">restrain</normalised> me of that liberty which<lb/>
Christ <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> purchased? <lb/>
Sol. No: but Christ has not purchased a liberty for you to be<lb/>
an Idolater, or an <normalised orig="Heretick" auto="true">Heretic</normalised>, or a maker of Sects, or a vicious<lb/>
Liver: Christ has not purchased a liberty for Arrius to deny<lb/>
his <normalised orig="Godhead" auto="true">Godhood</normalised>, nor for a Papist to worship the creature, nor<lb/>
for <normalised orig="Husbandmen" auto="true">Husbandman</normalised> and keepers of <normalised orig="cattell" auto="true">cattle</normalised>, to be Prophets, nor<lb/>
for any man to endanger the salvation of others; Christ has<lb/>
not purchased a liberty for every man to hold what <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> lift;<lb/>
Nor to serve God in his own way, for then some should be<lb/>
authorized by Christ to blaspheme God, and to serve God by<lb/>
sinning against him. Therefore this restraint is just, and not<lb/>
against christian liberty. <lb/>
2. <notvariant>Ob</notvariant>. But as good have no Religion, as no liberty to practise<lb/>

Faith, One <normalised orig="Baptisme" auto="true">Baptism</normalised>, One Lord over all and in all. 2. Ministers<lb/>

come; we are not Ministers so to one Congregation, as that<lb/>
we cannot exercise <normalised orig="ministeriall" auto="true">ministerial</normalised> Acts in another Congregation.<lb/>
3. The Members also of the Church are all baptised into that one<lb/>

Members one of another. 4. Lastly, All the Members by <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> <lb/>

they have a right in him, if where Paul and Apollos <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised><lb/>

Sol. That Act frees your Purses from Penalties indeed, but<lb/>
not your Consciences from Sin: Moses allowed a Bill of Divorcement,<lb/>
if any had put away his Wife and married another,<lb/>
without giving such a Bill, it had been death: But now though<lb/>
that Law did exempt the party from punishment, yet not from<lb/>
<normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>, and so our Saviour told the Pharisees, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 19.8">from the Beginning <lb/>
it was not so.</quote> Thus our Statute of Usury, allowing 8. percent.<lb/>

But if the Question be, Is it <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised> before God? We tell you,<lb/>
Nay: So in this case, you will not <normalised orig="sanctifie" auto="true">sanctify</normalised> the Sabbath in the<lb/>
<normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> Assemblies, if the Question be, Is this separation punishable?<lb/>
That Act tells you, Nay: But if the Question be,<lb/>
Is the Sabbath duly sanctified, and do men sin in forsaking the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Assemblyes" auto="true">Assemblies</normalised>? We tell you, Yea: The Magistrate remits only the<lb/>

powers may <normalised orig="mittigate" auto="true">mitigate</normalised> penalties, but they cannot make <normalised orig="Sinne" auto="true">Sin</normalised> to<lb/>

restraining power vindicated. <lb/>
4. There is yet one thing more belonging to the Christian Magistrate,<lb/>
and that is a Power to regulate and order Circumstances<lb/>
for the managing of an Ordinance, which in their <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised><lb/>
nature are necessary, yet left undetermined in Scripture: as for<lb/>
example, It is necessary in the <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised>, that some place for <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised><lb/>
Worship be chosen, that some <normalised orig="houres" auto="true">hours</normalised> be appointed, that<lb/>
the Minister use some Garments or other, &amp;c. seeing in such<lb/>
things there must be some way or other used, and yet none is<lb/>
limited in Scripture, therefore the Magistrate may order this<lb/>
<normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> of 9. and 3. from <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> meeting, rather than sun-rising<lb/>
or Midnight; and for the Place, the Church rather than<lb/>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
a <normalised orig="Taverne" auto="true">Tavern</normalised>: and for Habit, a black Gown rather than a white<lb/>
Cloak: the reason is, because that Circumstance, which I may<lb/>
<normalised orig="chuse" auto="true">choose</normalised> to my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, being free so to do, there being no institution<lb/>
of Christ in the thing, the same may the <normalised orig="civill" auto="true">civil</normalised> power ordain to <lb/>

Thus you have seen, that it is much that the Magistrate has<lb/>
to do in the things of God. 1. For Propagation: 2. For <choice ana="illegible">

and vicious living. 4. And for <normalised orig="setling" auto="true">settling</normalised> outward order among<lb/>
his people.<lb/>
Now follows the second branch of our Doctrine, viz. what the<lb/>
Magistrate may not do in matters of Religion. And here let the<lb/>
question be, whether the <normalised orig="civill" auto="true">civil</normalised> power may impose an act of worship,<lb/>
and force men by <normalised orig="temporall" auto="true">temporal</normalised> penalties to act against the convictions<lb/>
of their own conscience (as here Nebu. did the 3. Children?) Neg.<lb/>
For answer 2. are to be premised. 1. This question is not rightly<lb/>
resolved by distinguishing between an act of worship <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised><lb/>
&amp; <normalised orig="unlawfull" auto="true">unlawful</normalised>, as if a true Religion might be imposed, not a false;<lb/>
for every act of worship is supposed to be good in the judgement<lb/>
of the imposer, and <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> in the judgement of the refuser:<lb/>
and they whose hap it is to live under contrary commands, and<lb/>
contrary Religions, must either have a <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> conscience, or a miserable<lb/>
life; a <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> conscience, if he can take in all points of the<lb/>
compass, or else a miserable life under such change of penalties.<lb/>
2. I grant, that the Magistrate may <normalised orig="compell" auto="true">compel</normalised> such as do hold<lb/>
the faith, &amp; own the worship (yet neglect the same out of an <normalised orig="atheisticall" auto="true">atheistical</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="profanenes" auto="false">profaneness</normalised> and irreligiousness,) to present themselves<lb/>
to every such acknowledged act of Gods worship, as Asa did,<lb/>
2 Chron. 15. 13. that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of their<lb/>
Fathers should be put to death, &amp;c. Here Asa made compulsive<lb/>
Laws about Religion, and let the case be alike, the Christian Magistrate<lb/>
may <normalised orig="compell" auto="true">compel</normalised>, that is, to a confessed, known duty, because<lb/>
in such compulsion, the Magistrate does not pinch upon the<lb/>
conscience of the party, but upon his disorderly outward man,<lb/>
forcing him to the practise of a duty, which in his own conscience<lb/>
and practice, he <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised> to be a duty.<lb/>
These things premised, to the question as it is proposed, I answer,<lb/>
that the Magistrate may propose, but not impose; Instruct;<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(14)">C</fw>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
but not destroy men of a different judgement and way;<lb/>
he may <normalised orig="restraine" auto="true">restrain</normalised> any false way (which is contrary to that which<lb/>
he takes himself bound to maintain.) But not force to a positive<lb/>
acting against the convictions of their own conscience, he may<lb/>
not set up an Image and a <normalised orig="Fornace" auto="true">Furnace</normalised>, he may not say, bow, or <lb/>
<normalised orig="burne" auto="true">burn</normalised>.<lb/>
Reas. 1. Because then a false worship may be imposed, as well as<lb/>
the true, and the godly men undone, by refusing a false worship,<lb/>
as well as <normalised orig="carnall" auto="true">carnal</normalised> people by not observing the true: John Hass,<lb/>
                  nobis catholicis fuit h≈ìreticus, said Bellarmine, and was therefore<lb/>
burned alive at Constance: <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> what reasons one side gives<lb/>

other side to punish them <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> for the like <normalised orig="refusall" auto="true">refusal</normalised>; the same<lb/>
argument was used against Paul at Philippi, Acts 16.21. [viz.<lb/>

                  <lb/>
Gods] which Paul himself at first had used, when he persecuted<lb/>
the Christians. <lb/>
Reas. 2. It is against the nature of faith and worship to be<lb/>
forced: suaderi, non cogi vult fides: Quis imponet mihi necessititem <lb/>
aut credendi quod nolim, aut quod velim, non credendi? I<lb/>
cannot believe against my will, neither can I disbelieve at my<lb/>
pleasure, much <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> at the will and pleasure of another. So for<lb/>
worship, God is not pleased with a forced worship, God is to<lb/>
be served with a perfect heart, and a willing <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>, and whatsoever<lb/>
we <normalised orig="performe" auto="true">perform</normalised> against our will, or with an ill will, grudgingly,<lb/>
or with an unbelieving heart, not being <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> of<lb/>
the <normalised orig="lawfulnesse" auto="true">lawfulness</normalised> thereof, it is sin; It is like the cutting off a<lb/>
Dogs neck.<lb/>
3. Reas. To impose an act of worship under bodily punishments,<lb/>
to come with an Image and a <normalised orig="Fornace" auto="true">Furnace</normalised>, is properly that<lb/>
which we call <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> tyranny over the conscience, for seeing<lb/>
man cannot punish the conscience directly, by an immediate<lb/>
<normalised orig="stroak" auto="true">stroke</normalised> [God alone can wound and heale the conscience:] <lb/>
therefore all the force and punishment done upon the conscience<lb/>
by men, must be by the body: This is properly to force<lb/>
and <normalised orig="Tyrannize" auto="false">Tyrannise</normalised> over the conscience, when men are brought<lb/>
to this <normalised orig="straite" auto="true">strait</normalised>, that either the bodily estate must perish to save<lb/>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
the conscience whole: or else the conscience must be wounded to<lb/>
save the body, &amp; the estate whole: This is a Lording over <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised><lb/>
conscience: This was the sad condition of our Fathers that lived<lb/>
under the lash of Hen. 8. his six knotted whip, I <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised>, the six<lb/>
Articles; He came with an Image and a <normalised orig="Fornace" auto="true">Furnace</normalised>, if the Papists<lb/>
refused to acknowledge his supremacy, they must be hanged for<lb/>
Traitors. To the Protestants he came with transubstantiation,<lb/>
and a Faggot, if they refused to bow to that breaden <normalised orig="Idoll" auto="true">Idol</normalised>,<lb/>
they must be burnt for <normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised>.<lb/>
Thus some Bishops requiring subscription too rigidly to all<lb/>
the ceremonies, and silencing the Non-conformists [though<lb/>
men otherwise of quiet spirits, and <normalised orig="usefull" auto="true">useful</normalised> gifts] were deemed to<lb/>
exercise a <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> tyranny over <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> consciences, because they<lb/>
came with an image and a <normalised orig="fornace" auto="true">furnace</normalised>, subscription, or deprivation.<lb/>
The like things done by other men in other changes of times,<lb/>
is really the same sin, though the men and names be changed:<lb/>
Hereupon Mr. Burroughs <normalised orig="breakes" auto="true">breaks</normalised> out into this prayer, God<lb/>
grant we never meddle with any thing answerable to that tyranny,<lb/>
and exhorts thus, the tables may <normalised orig="turne" auto="true">turn</normalised> one day, wherein<lb/>
the sufferers shall have the greatest ease, and the inflicters the<lb/>
sorest <normalised orig="burthen" auto="true">burden</normalised>, but God forbid that their brethren should lay it<lb/>
upon them, though it were put into their power to do it.<lb/>
Reas. 4. Thus to enforce an act of Religion is against the prime<lb/>
dictate of nature, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 7.12">All things whatsoever <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> would that men should<lb/>
do to you</quote>, do you the same to them, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 7.12">for this is the Law</quote> of nature,<lb/>
and of God by his Prophets. It is a strange thing to consider<lb/>
how <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> spirits and minds do alter with their condition, so as<lb/>
to <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> the same things just or unjust, according as it comes<lb/>
to their <normalised orig="turnes" auto="true">turns</normalised> to be up, or down, to be above, or beneath: men<lb/>
would not think it equitable to be so dealt with, as they <normalised orig="deale" auto="true">deal</normalised><lb/>
now with others: He that sends out <normalised orig="groanes" auto="true">groans</normalised> for liberty, if <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised><lb/>
shall make others <normalised orig="groane" auto="true">groan</normalised> for lack of the same, though the thing<lb/>
imposed be perhaps just and righteous, yet his act of imposing<lb/>
is most unrighteous, because he sins against the light of nature,<lb/>

                  <lb/>
even because he commands it, that is, for his own Authorities<lb/>
sake, Gods Commands are good, because commanded by<lb/>
him: But <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> commands are subject to examination, and<lb/>

And in such case of non-obedience, the reverence<lb/>

to their worship in an active Obedience, (as here these three<lb/>
children did.)<lb/>
Use. I end with <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> short Admonitions and Cautions to <lb/>
the party that does dissent, and craves not to be imposed upon,<lb/>
nor forced by <normalised orig="temporall" auto="true">temporal</normalised> punishments to act against the convictions <lb/>
of his own conscience, let him precisely observe these<lb/>
<normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> Rules.<lb/>
Caution 1. Take heed, beware how thou dare pretend conscience<lb/>
for thy non-obedience, when it is something else, as<lb/>
perhaps Pride, Affectation of applause, Humour, <normalised orig="Selfe" auto="true">Self</normalised> interest,<lb/>
&amp;c. Do not dare so to abuse thy conscience, as to make it a<lb/>
<normalised orig="baude" auto="true">bawd</normalised> to thy lust, for then humour will be conscience, Pride and<lb/>
<normalised orig="Schisme" auto="true">Schism</normalised> will be conscience, filthy lucre and <normalised orig="vaine-glory" auto="false">vainglory</normalised> will be<lb/>
conscience, <normalised orig="Selfe-ends" auto="false">Self-ends</normalised> and Self-interest will be conscience;<lb/>
And so that <normalised orig="pretious" auto="true">precious</normalised> sparkle of Divine Majesty set up in thy<lb/>
breast to <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> thee in awe of <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>, shall be made a <normalised orig="cloake" auto="true">cloak</normalised> for<lb/>
<normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>, to <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised> with the more liberty and security. As it is<lb/>
a great <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised> to act against the standing indictment of our<lb/>
own conscience, so it is a singular abuse of the omnipotent,<lb/>
holy, sin-revenging God, to plead conscience for the doing,<lb/>
or not-doing of this or that, when as there is nothing <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> than<lb/>
conscience in the <normalised orig="busines" auto="true">business</normalised>; -- Such a man <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised> with a protection,<lb/>
He has gotten his conscience, yea, God <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> to be<lb/>
the <normalised orig="protectour" auto="true">protector</normalised> of his <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised>; And such men, if they can<lb/>
be discovered, deserve to be twice punished, once for their<lb/>
fault, another time for their holy pretence. <normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> a great<lb/>
<normalised orig="boldnesse" auto="true">boldness</normalised> to make conscience a Sanctuary for any disorder.<lb/>
2. Let the dissenting party, though he cannot <normalised orig="conforme" auto="true">conform</normalised> to<lb/>
the Injunctions of Authority in some point of opinion or worship,<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(18)">C 3</fw>
                  <pb n="18"/>
                  <lb/>
yet carry <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> so innocently, peaceably and unoffensively<lb/>
in other respects, that the Magistrate may <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised><lb/>
thee, and have cause to say, I have no occasion or matter against<lb/>
him, save in the Law of his God, (as it was said of Daniel,<lb/>
Dan. 6. 5.)<lb/>
3 For the manner of <normalised orig="refusall" auto="true">refusal</normalised>, be <normalised orig="carefull" auto="true">careful</normalised> to carry it in an<lb/>
humble, quiet, <normalised orig="Selfe-denying" auto="false">Self-denying</normalised> way; do not <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised> it out with<lb/>
railing, or Pride, or Turbulence of spirit factiously or seditiously:<lb/>
<normalised orig="Hee" auto="true">He</normalised> that does dissent from the <normalised orig="publikly" auto="true">publicly</normalised> owned and<lb/>
<normalised orig="establisht" auto="true">established</normalised> way, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> great reason to be humble and jealous of<lb/>
his own <normalised orig="weaknesse" auto="true">weakness</normalised>. When a man by reason of his conscience<lb/>
dissents from the <normalised orig="civill" auto="true">civil</normalised> power, if he can enjoy his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> inward<lb/>
peace and outward quiet, he should discover a very ill spirit to<lb/>
<normalised orig="poure" auto="true">pour</normalised> contempt and <normalised orig="scorne" auto="true">scorn</normalised> upon the truths of God <normalised orig="publikly" auto="true">publicly</normalised><lb/>
preached, or to cast dirt upon the <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> which he opposed, or<lb/>
<normalised orig="contemne" auto="true">contemn</normalised> and <normalised orig="vilifie" auto="true">vilify</normalised> those that differ from him.<lb/>
4. Be sure, practically to put a difference between non-obedience,<lb/>
and disobedience or Rebellion; if thou be required any<lb/>
thing which is contrary to thy judgement, sit <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> with a<lb/>
modest non-obedience, But let not thy spirit be carried out to<lb/>
<normalised orig="rebell" auto="true">rebel</normalised>, or to setting up of Image against Image, worship against<lb/>
worship, Assembly against Assembly, in a visible opposition to <lb/>
the <normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised>. <lb/>
<notvariant>Ob</notvariant>. And if thy case be such as that of Peter and James, Acts<lb/>
4. 18. They were commanded <quote type="biblical" ana="Acts 4.18">not to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> at all, nor to teach in<lb/>
the Name of Jesus</quote>, yet they did <notvariant>Ver</notvariant>. 19. because God had commanded <lb/>
them to preach in his Name.<lb/>
Sol. Then remember thou art under a double bond of conscience <lb/>
at the same time, one from God, who commands thee<lb/>
to preach; Another from men, who command thee not to<lb/>
Preach; But here in this case, thy conscience is discharged.<lb/>
1. Unto God by doing what he commands thee, and 2. To the<lb/>
Magistrate by submitting to his power in suffering, And so thy<lb/>
duty to God, and thy reverence due to authority are both preserved.<lb/>
And thus I am brought to my second Doctrine.<lb/>
Quest. In case of injurious impositions, what is a Christian <lb/>
to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>?<lb/>

6. The Church will enjoy more truth in Power and Purity,<lb/>
