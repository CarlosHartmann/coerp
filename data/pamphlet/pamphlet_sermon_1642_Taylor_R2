the fifth Chapter of the <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> of <notvariant>Tobias</notvariant>, and part of the sixteenth <lb/>
verse.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
So they went forth both and departed, and the dog of the young<lb/>
man went with them. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
BEfore I enter upon my Text, Beloved, it<lb/>
is correspondent, meet, necessario and<lb/>
convenient, that I do <normalised orig="unveile" auto="false">unveil</normalised>, lay open,<lb/>
describe, discover, and manifest unto<lb/>
you, some reasons why, wherefore, upon<lb/>
what causes, grounds, or reasons, this<lb/>
Dog is mentioned in my Text.<lb/>
This portion that I shall administer<lb/>
unto you at this time, I have divided into six parts; first, the<lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
time when this Dog lived; secondly, whose Dog <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was;<lb/>
thirdly, whither he went; fourthly, what <normalised orig="fashion'd" auto="true">fashioned</normalised> or kind <lb/>
of Dog <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was; <normalised orig="fifthly" auto="false">fiftly</normalised>, his demeanour and carriage; and<lb/>
lastly, his name: Of all these in order, as 3 <normalised orig="houres" auto="true">hours</normalised> short<lb/>
time, and your long patience will permit.<lb/>
First, the time that this Dog lived, was about the death of<lb/>
Zenacherib, that blasphemous King of Assyria, as it is in the<lb/>
first of Tobit, and the one and twentieth verse, where is mention<lb/>
made, that after he was <normalised orig="slaine" auto="true">slain</normalised>, Sarchedonus his son <normalised orig="raigned" auto="true">reigned</normalised><lb/>
after him. It was then a wicked time, full of oppression, <lb/>
<normalised orig="crueltie" auto="true">cruelty</normalised>, and <normalised orig="idolatrie" auto="true">idolatry</normalised>: and at this time lived honest,<lb/>
old, hospitable <notvariant>Tobias</notvariant>, who being oppressed by tyranny, went<lb/>
into Media, and left ten <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic><normalised orig="Tallent" auto="true">Talent</normalised>*</sic>
                     <corr><normalised orig="Tallents" auto="true">Talents</normalised></corr>
                  </choice> of silver in safe custody with<lb/>
his kinsman Gabael, who dwelt in a <normalised orig="citie" auto="true">city</normalised> called Rages in<lb/>
Media, as you shall find it in the first Chapter and fourteenth<lb/>
verse. Beloved, Toby was of the Tribe of Nepthalim, who<lb/>
were idolatrous, and offered to an Heifer they called Ball,<lb/>
Chap. 1. 5. in Galilee, and dwelt in a <normalised orig="citie" auto="true">city</normalised> called Thisbe<lb/>
there, from whence <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was carried captive into Assyria by<lb/>
Salmanazer, as you shall have it in the first and second verses.<lb/>
Now it <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised> that Toby, after much trouble went<lb/>
home <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, Chap. 2. and <normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>. 1. This was the time wherein<lb/>
this Dog lived. I will presently proceed, and go forward,<lb/>
or <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> further, as your patience may permit.<lb/>
About this time old <notvariant>Tobias</notvariant> was stricken blind, and in some<lb/>
want of his ten <normalised orig="Tallents" auto="true">Talents</normalised> of silver, which <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> left so far off in<lb/>
Media with Gabael, for which he determined to send his son<lb/>
(young <notvariant>Tobias</notvariant>) but he was in great care to have a Guide with<lb/>
him in so long a journey, and to help him to bring so great a<lb/>
charge as ten <normalised orig="Tallents" auto="true">Talents</normalised> back with him (which is, <normalised orig="Ile" auto="true">Isle</normalised> warrant<lb/>
you, 40 pounds of our money, or thereabouts) and in the third<lb/>
Chapter and the nineteenth verse, the Angel Raphael came in<lb/>
the shape of a man, whom old <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>Tobiab</sic>
                     <corr><notvariant>Tobias</notvariant></corr>
                  </choice> hired for a groat a day<lb/>
to go with his son out and home as it is in the 5 of Tobit and<lb/>
14 verse. And thus much shall suffice for the time when the <lb/>
Dog lived.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(4)">A2</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
So they went forth both, and departed, and the dog of the <lb/>
young man went with them.<lb/>
Some simple observations might be gathered out of the first<lb/>
word of my Text, So; but it is a matter of So, so, and therefore<lb/>
I will <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> it over so; yet (Beloved) as wee are men<lb/>
all made of one mold, one proportion and shape, our <normalised orig="sences" auto="true">senses</normalised><lb/>
all alike, So it is not <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised> that one man should have any<lb/>
power or <normalised orig="authoritie" auto="true">authority</normalised> over another so as they have; but every<lb/>
man ought to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> a rule and guide to <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, So that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised><lb/>
should not need to be ruled so, and guided so by other men;<lb/>
for many men desire <normalised orig="soveraigntie" auto="true">sovereignty</normalised>, <normalised orig="superioritie" auto="true">superiority</normalised>, <normalised orig="dignitie" auto="true">dignity</normalised>, promotion,<lb/>
advancement, <normalised orig="preheminence" auto="true">pre-eminence</normalised>, domination, sway (or<lb/>
call it what you please) but the truth is (my Brethren) that as<lb/>
we are all made alike, So wee should equally rule alike, and <lb/>
live in such a <normalised orig="communitie" auto="true">community</normalised>, that all things should be in common,<lb/>
So that mine is thine, and thine is mine, <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> it what it<lb/>
will, either wife, children, goods, or lands, &amp;c. So that<lb/>
none shall command, nor any one obey: and so much shall<lb/>
suffice to be spoken of the word So. So they went forth.<lb/>
They, what They ? The word is not in the singular number,<lb/>
He or she went forth, but They, which <normalised orig="argueth" auto="true">argues</normalised> the <normalised orig="pluralitie" auto="true">plurality</normalised><lb/>
of They that went forth; now who <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>where</sic>
                     <corr>were</corr>
                  </choice> this <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>t*ey</sic>
                     <corr>they</corr>
                  </choice>?<lb/>
This they were no other than the <normalised orig="Angell" auto="true">Angel</normalised> Raphael, who was<lb/>
hired for a groat a day by old Tobit (as is before specified in <lb/>
the first <normalised orig="leafe" auto="true">leaf</normalised> and seventeenth page) and the other who was <lb/>
one of the same they (without whom they could not have<lb/>
<normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> they) was young <notvariant>Tobias</notvariant> the son of old <notvariant>Tobias</notvariant>, who having<lb/>
taken leave of his father, went to fetch the ten <normalised orig="Tallents" auto="true">Talents</normalised><lb/>
of silver from Gabael at Rages in Media. So they went forth<lb/>
and departed, and the dog of the young man went with them. So<lb/>
they went.<lb/>
It is to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> noted, that if they had not <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> sent, they<lb/>
would not have went: Beloved, this is an instruction of <normalised orig="reproofe" auto="true">reproof</normalised><lb/>
to such as will do nothing but what they are bidden,<lb/>
nor go any whither except they be sent or commanded; but<lb/>
those that are industrious will <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> <normalised orig="busie" auto="true">busy</normalised> in some <lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
thing, though they have no thanks for their <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised>, it is no <lb/>
matter for that, So they went, they were sent in a <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised> errand,<lb/>
but that is no rule to us, that we should stay till wee be<lb/>
sent; for when should I have been sent to preach? I think<lb/>
never. Therefore as many zealous Trades-men before <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised>,<lb/>
went and thrust themselves into this holy Calling, without <lb/>
being sent; so I having tried trade after trade, hard Iron and<lb/>
<normalised orig="Steele" auto="true">Steel</normalised>, and soft Books and Ballads, have now fallen upon the<lb/>
only common trade of trades to preach, and indeed my <normalised orig="zeale" auto="true">zeal</normalised><lb/>
was so hot that I had no <normalised orig="leasure" auto="true">leisure</normalised> to stay till I was sent forth:<lb/>
but I as they (the rest of my brethren) so went forth. So they<lb/>
went forth both.<lb/>
Both <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <normalised orig="signifie" auto="true">signify</normalised> two, <normalised orig="twaine" auto="true">twain</normalised>, a couple, a <normalised orig="paire" auto="true">pair</normalised>, a <normalised orig="duplicitie" auto="false">duplicity</normalised>,<lb/>
or the <normalised orig="Plurall" auto="true">Plural</normalised> Number, They went forth both. The Dog<lb/>
is not yet specified, for then it might have been said, that three<lb/>
went forth both at once; but they went forth and departed.<lb/>
This word and standing betwixt forth and departed, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a <lb/>
<normalised orig="mysticall" auto="true">mystical</normalised> sense, that a man may <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> forth and not depart, that<lb/>
he may also depart and not <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> forth, And that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> may both <lb/>
<normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> forth and depart, and likewise he may neither depart or<lb/>
<normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> forth. I went forth and departed from one calling to another,<lb/>
I went forth and departed from an Iron-monger to be<lb/>
a Book-seller, and I thank the whole Company of Stationers<lb/>
they took my kind intrusion into their <normalised orig="Societie" auto="true">Society</normalised> with more<lb/>
respect than it becomes <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> to make boast of; but lately I <lb/>
went forth and departed from that Function, and am Theologically<lb/>
qualified, and if that <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> not thrive with me, I can<lb/>
<normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised> to the Book-sellers trade <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, with as much leave<lb/>
and love as I had before. And thus much shall suffice, <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised>,<lb/>
or be enough, or sufficient for the explanation, manifestation, <lb/>
or declaration, for your edification of this part of my Text,<lb/>
So they went forth both and departed.<lb/>
And the dog of the young man went with them.<lb/>
This word And (Beloved) I have somewhat spoken of <lb/>
before, yet there is observation worthy to be noted, which is,<lb/>
that this (And) is never placed in the end, last word or<lb/>

afterwards, as it is in my Text, And the Dog of the young man<lb/>
went with them.<lb/>
The Dog (my Brethren) was the Dog of the young man,<lb/>
which by interpretation was the young mans dog, now the<lb/>
young man was young <notvariant>Tobias</notvariant>, and old <notvariant>Tobias</notvariant> being his father,<lb/>
(out of question) young <notvariant>Tobias</notvariant> was his son, and the <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised><lb/>
owner and master of the Dog. There is not any mention<lb/>
made, that this Dog was commanded, or called to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> with<lb/>
his Master; no sure, he was a loving and a willing Dog, to <lb/>
attend <choice ana="illegible">

                     <corr>Dog</corr>
                  </choice> was a Dog of extraordinary note,<lb/>
for he is mentioned for his diligent attendance <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> in the<lb/>
eleventh Chapter and fourth verse, in these words, And the <lb/>
Dog followed them.<lb/>
In my text it is said that the Dog went with them, and here<lb/>
it is said that the Dog followed them; in both places there is <lb/>
much <normalised orig="dutie" auto="true">duty</normalised> <normalised orig="exprest" auto="true">expressed</normalised>: In the first here is to be noted Toby, Tobies<lb/>
Dog, and Tobies Dogs <normalised orig="taile" auto="true">tail</normalised>: In the second, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> went <lb/>
with them when they went from home: and in the latter,<lb/>
he followed them at their <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised> back. It is said <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> followed, <lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> went not saucily before his Master. I will not<lb/>
question what age this Dog was of, or whether <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was<lb/>
<normalised orig="whelp'd" auto="false">whelped</normalised> in the Dogs <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, or out of the Dogs <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, or in <lb/>
the Cats nights; for there is no Dogs nights, though<lb/>
the learned write of the beginning of the <normalised orig="Dog-dayes" auto="false">Dog-days</normalised>, and of<lb/>
the ending of them also: but surely this was a wise Dog,<lb/>
not a wag wanton, or a foolish <normalised orig="Puppie-dog" auto="false">Puppy-dog</normalised>, but he was a sage<lb/>
and a wise Dog, and my reason is, because he followed them,<lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
attended upon them, waited upon them, and did not stir<lb/>

way prove or find, that he was gelt or <normalised orig="libb'd" auto="false">libbed</normalised>, as I may <normalised orig="terme" auto="true">term</normalised><lb/>
it, which made this Dog the more observant and <normalised orig="dutifull" auto="true">dutiful</normalised>;<lb/>
but whether <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was or no, I am confident <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was a <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised><lb/>
mannerly Dog, for he did not run before and yelp, and baule,<lb/>
Waw, waw, waw, no, he went forth with them mildly, gently,<lb/>

There are divers opinions amongst the Learned concerning<lb/>
this Dog; Quabo the American in his third Book, fol.<lb/>
900 of his Dogmatists ; and Nimpshag the Gymnosophist,<lb/>
both these <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> agree, that this Dog was no <normalised orig="Bob-tail'd" auto="false">Bob-tailed</normalised> Tyke,<lb/>
Trun <normalised orig="le-tail'd" auto="false">le-tailed</normalised> Tyke, Wee Tyke, or Muckle Tyke (as you<lb/>
call Dogs in Scotland.) Surely my opinion is, that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was<lb/>
no Hound (though all Dogs are called Hounds in Germany,<lb/>
and for one man to call another Hounds-foot, it is dangerous<lb/>
to be spoken.) <notvariant>Tobias</notvariant> was no Hunter, therefore it cannot be<lb/>
gathered that it was a Buck-hound, Blood-hound, Otterhound,<lb/>
Goose-hound, Grey-hound, Fox-hound, or any kind <lb/>
of <choice ana="illegible">

was neither Land, or Water <normalised orig="Spaniell" auto="true">Spaniel</normalised> ; neither was <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> a <lb/>

                  <lb/>
Anna was stricken in <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>, and therefore they had no delight<lb/>
to play with Whelps or Puppies (my Brothers) of that<lb/>
or the like Litter; nor was it a Shogh from Ireland, or an <lb/>
Island Cur; for those are Dogs of small delight to ancient<lb/>
people, and young <notvariant>Tobias</notvariant> was unmarried, therefore <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had <lb/>
no wife to play with a Dog. I cannot think this Dog to be a<lb/>
<normalised orig="Mungrell" auto="true">Mongrel</normalised>, because he was not variable, but kind and constant<lb/>
to his Master. Nor was it a <normalised orig="Mastiffe" auto="true">Mastiff</normalised>, a Bull-dog, or a <normalised orig="Beare-dog" auto="false">bear-dog</normalised>,<lb/>
for such sports are for such as can see, for young people,<lb/>
for <normalised orig="Beare-wards" auto="false">Bear-wards</normalised>, Butchers, and such grave Athenians, and<lb/>
not for old blind folks. In <normalised orig="summe" auto="true">sum</normalised>, this Dog is manifestly<lb/>
and <normalised orig="authentiquely" auto="false">authentically</normalised> supposed to be a Whippet, or <normalised orig="prettie" auto="true">pretty</normalised> handsome<lb/>

this Dog would give warning and bark before he bit. From<lb/>
which <normalised orig="vertues" auto="true">virtues</normalised> of this <normalised orig="Apocryphall" auto="true">Apocryphal</normalised> Dog, many worthy instructions<lb/>
might be gleaned and gathered: but (Beloved)<lb/>
