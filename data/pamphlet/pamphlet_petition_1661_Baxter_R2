THe special Providence of God, and His <choice ana="illegible">

                     <corr>Majesties</corr>

                  <lb/>
tender regard of the Peace and <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>Con*ciences</sic>
                     <corr>Consciences</corr>
                  </choice> of His <lb/>
Subjects, and his desire of their Concord in the <lb/>
things of God, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> put into our hands this opportunity<lb/>
of speaking to you as humble Petitioners, <lb/>
as well as Commissioners, on the behalf of these yet troubled and <lb/>
unhealed Churches, and of many thousand souls that are dear to <lb/>
Christ; on whose behalf, we are pressed in spirit in the <normalised orig="sence" auto="true">sense</normalised> of our <lb/>
duty, most earnestly to beseech you, as you tender the peace and <lb/>
prosperity of these Churches, the comfort of His Majesty in the <lb/>
union of His Subjects, and the peace of your souls in the great day <lb/>
of your accounts, that laying by all former and present exasperating <lb/>
and alienating differences, you will not now deny us your <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>cons*n*</sic>
                     <corr>consent</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
and assistance to those means that shall be proved honest and <lb/>
cheap, and <normalised orig="needfull" auto="true">needful</normalised> to those great, desirable ends, for which we all <lb/>
<normalised orig="professe" auto="true">profess</normalised> to have our offices, and our lives. <lb/>
The things which we humbly beg of you are these: <lb/>
1. That you will grant what we have here proposed and craved <lb/>
of you in our Preface; Even your charitable interpretation, acceptance <lb/>
of, and consent unto the alterations and additions to the Liturgy <lb/>
now tendered unto you, that being inserted, as we have expressed, <lb/>
it [may be left to the Ministers choyce to use one or other <lb/>
at his discretion] upon His Majesties approbation, according to his <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="2">A2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
gracious Declaration concerning Ecclesiastical Affairs. And that <lb/>
(seeing we cannot obtain the form of Episcopal Government, described <lb/>
by the late Reverend Primate of Ireland, and approved by <lb/>
many Episcopal Divines) we may at least enjoy those benefits of <lb/>
Reformation in Discipline, and that freedom from Subscription, <lb/>
Oaths and Ceremonies, which are granted in the said Declaration, <lb/>
by the means of your charitable Mediation and Request. <lb/>
2. Seeing some hundreds of able, holy, <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> Ministers are <lb/>
of late cast out, and not only very many of their Families in great <lb/>
<normalised orig="distresse" auto="true">distress</normalised>, but (which is of far greater moment) abundance of Congregations <lb/>
in England, Ireland and Wales, are overspread with lamentable <lb/>
ignorance, and are destitute of able, <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> Teachers: <lb/>
And seeing too many that are insufficient, negligent or scandalous, <lb/>
are over the Flocks (not meaning this as an accusation of any that <lb/>
are not guilty, nor a dishonourable Reflection on any party, much <lb/>
<normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> on the whole Church) we take this opportunity earnestly to <lb/>
beseech you, that you will contribute your endeavours to the Removal <lb/>
of those that are the shame and burdens of the Churches; <lb/>
and to the <normalised orig="Restauration" auto="true">Restoration</normalised> of such as may be an honour and blessing to <lb/>
them. And to that end, that it be not imputed to them as their <lb/>
unpardonable Crime, that they were born in an Age and Country <lb/>
which required Ordination by Parochial Pastors, without Diocesans: <lb/>
And that Re-ordination (whether absolute or hypothetical) <lb/>
be not made necessary to the future exercise of their Ministry. But <lb/>
that an Universal <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>Confi*mation</sic>
                     <corr>Confirmation</corr>
                  </choice> may be granted of those ordained <lb/>
as aforesaid, they being still responsible for any personal insufficiency <lb/>
or crime. Were these two granted (the Confirmation of the <lb/>
Grants in His Majesties Declaration, with the liberty of the Reformed <lb/>
Liturgy offered you, and the restoring of able, <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> Ministers <lb/>
to a capacity to be serviceable in the Church of God, without <lb/>
forcing them against their Consciences to be Re-ordained) how <lb/>
great would be the benefits to this unworthy Nation? How glad <lb/>
would you make the peoples hearts? how <normalised orig="thankfull" auto="true">thankful</normalised> should we be <lb/>
(for the cause of Christ, and the souls of men) to those that grant <lb/>
them, and procure them; being conscious that we seek not great <lb/>
things for our selves, or for our Brethren; that we are ambitious <lb/>
of no greater wealth or honour, than our daily bread, with such <lb/>
freedom and advantage for the labours of our Ministry, as may most <lb/>
conduce to the success, the increase of holiness and peace we shall <lb/>
take the boldness to second these Requests, with many of our Reasons, <lb/>
which we think should prevail for your consent, <normalised orig="chusing" auto="true">choosing</normalised> rather <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
to incur whatsoever censures or offence may by any be taken <lb/>
against our necessary freedom of expression, than to be silent at such <lb/>
a time as this, when thousands of the servants of the Lord, that are <lb/>
either deprived of their <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> Teachers or in fears of losing <lb/>
them, together with the freedom of their Consciences in Gods <lb/>
worship, do cry day and night to Heaven for help, and would cry <lb/>
also in your ears with more importunate Requests, if they had but <lb/>
the opportunity as now we have. <lb/>
And 1. We beseech you bear with us while we remember you, <lb/>
that you are Pastors of the flock of Christ, who are bound to feed <lb/>
them, and to preach in season, and out of season, and to be laborious <lb/>
in the Word and Doctrine; but are not bound to hinder all <lb/>
others from this blessed work, that dare not use a <normalised orig="Crosse" auto="true">Cross</normalised> or Surplice, <lb/>
or worship God in a form which they judge disorderly, defective, <lb/>
or corrupt, when they have better to offer him (Mal.1.13,14.) <lb/>
Is it not for matter and phrase at least as agreeable to the holy <lb/>
Scriptures? If so, we beseech you suffer us to use it, who seek nothing <lb/>
by it, but to worship God as near as we can, according to <lb/>
his will, who is jealous in the matters of his worship. If indeed <lb/>
yours have more of strength, and ours of weakness, yet let not Fathers <lb/>
cast the children from the house of God, because they are sick <lb/>
or weak, and need the more compassion; let not our Physicians resolve <lb/>
their Patients shall all be famished, or cast off, whose temperature <lb/>
and appetites cannot agree to feed on the same dish, with <lb/>
the same preparation and sauce. He that thrice charged Peter as he <lb/>
loved him, to feed his Lambs and Sheep, did never think of charging <lb/>
him to deny them food, or turn them out of his fold, or forbid <lb/>
all others to feed them unless they could digest such forms <lb/>
and ceremonies, and superscriptions as ours. <lb/>
2. May we presume to mind you, that the Lord of the Harvest <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> commanded us to pray that more Labourers may be sent into <lb/>
the Harvest. (For still proportionably <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 9.37">the Harvest is great and <lb/>
the Labourers are few</quote>) Mat. 9. 37. And that the Lord <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not <lb/>
furnished them with his gifts in vain, nor lighted these Candles to <lb/>
put under a Bushel, but to be set on a Candlestick, that they may <lb/>
give light to all that are in the house, Mat. 5. 15. And that there <lb/>
are few Nations under the heavens of God, as far as we can learn,<lb/>
that have more able, holy, <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised>, laborious and truly peaceable <lb/>
Preachers of the Gospel (proportionably) than those are that are <lb/>
now cast out in England, and are like in England, Scotland, and <lb/>
Ireland, to be cast out, if the old Conformity be urged. This <lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="witnesse" auto="true">witness</normalised> is true, which in Judgement we bear, and must record against <lb/>
all the reproaches of uncharitableness, which the justifier of <lb/>
the Righteous at his day will effectually confute. We therefore beseech <lb/>
you, that when thousands of souls are ready to famish for <lb/>
want of the bread of Life, and thousands more are grieved for the <lb/>
Ejection of their <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> Guides, the Labourers may not be kept <lb/>
out, upon the account of such Forms or Ceremonies, or Re-ordination; <lb/>
at least till you have <normalised orig="enow" auto="true">enough</normalised> as fit as they to supply their <lb/>
places, and then we shall never Petition you for them more. <lb/>
3. And we beseech you consider when you should promote the <lb/>
joy and thankfulness of His Majesties Subjects for his happy <normalised orig="Restauration" auto="true">Restoration</normalised>, <lb/>
whether it be equal and seasonable to bring upon so many <lb/>
of them so great calamities as the change of able, <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> Ministers, <lb/>
for such as they cannot comfortably commit the conduct of <lb/>
their souls to, and the depriving them of the Liberty of the <normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised> <lb/>
Worship; calamities far greater than the <normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> loss of all their <lb/>
worldly substance can amount to: In a day of Common Joy to <lb/>
bring this <normalised orig="causelesly" auto="true">causelessly</normalised> on so many of His Majesties Subjects, and to <lb/>
force them to <normalised orig="lye" auto="true">lie</normalised> down in heart-breaking sorrows, as being almost <lb/>
as far undone, as Man can do it; this is not a due requital of the <lb/>
Lord for so great deliverances: Especially considering, that if it <lb/>
were never so certain, that it is the sin of the Ministers that dare <lb/>
not be Re-ordained, or conform; its hard that so many thousand <lb/>
innocent people should suffer even in their souls for the faults of <lb/>
others. <lb/>
4. And if we thought it would not be mis-interpreted, we <lb/>
would here remember you, how great and considerable a part of <lb/>
the three Nations they are, that must either incur these sufferings, <lb/>
or condole them that undergo them; and how great a grief it will <lb/>
be to His Majesty, to see his grieved Subjects; and how great a joy <lb/>
it will be to him, to have their hearty thanks and prayers, and see <lb/>
them live in prosperity, peace and comfort under his most happy<lb/>
Government. <lb/>
5. And we may plead the nature of their cause, to move you to <lb/>
compassionate your poor afflicted Brethren in their sufferings. It is, <lb/>
in your own account, but for refusing Conformity to things indifferent, <lb/>
or at the <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>m*st</sic>
                     <corr>most</corr>
                  </choice>, of no necessity to salvation. It is in their account <lb/>
for the sake of Christ, because they dare not consent to that <lb/>
which they judge to be an usurpation of his Kingly power, and an<lb/>
accusation of his Laws as insufficient, and because they dare not be <lb/>
guilty of addition to, or diminution of his Worship, or of worshipping <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
him after any other Law, than that by which they must be<lb/>
judged, or such as is merely subordinate to that. Suppose they <lb/>
be mistaken in thinking the things to be so displeasing to God; yet <lb/>
it is commendable in them to be <normalised orig="fearfull" auto="true">fearful</normalised> of displeasing him, and <lb/>
<normalised orig="carefull" auto="true">careful</normalised> to obey him; a disposition necessary to all that will be saved, <lb/>
and therefore to be loved and cherished in them by the Pastors <lb/>
of the Church; who should be very tender of putting them to <lb/>
suffering, or casting them out of the Church, because they dare not <lb/>
do that which they judge to be so great a sin against the Lord, deserving <lb/>
damnation to themselves. Should not the love of Christ <lb/>
command us to be tender of those that are so tender of his honour, <lb/>
and to take heed what we do to men for taking heed of sin, and being <lb/>
afraid to offend the Lord; and should not the special love of <lb/>
Christians, and the common love of men, command us, to be <lb/>
loath to drive men by penalties, upon that which they judge <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <lb/>
tend to their everlasting damnation, and which indeed <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> tend <lb/>
to it, because they judge it so to do; For he that will do that which <lb/>
he thinks to be so great a sin as is before described, to please men, <lb/>
or to escape their punishment, no doubt <normalised orig="deserveth" auto="true">deserves</normalised> the wrath of <lb/>
God, and should we not be loath to drive men upon sin and condemnation, <lb/>
though we were sure that their own infirmity is the occasion.<lb/>
If it be said, that by this Rule nothing shall be commanded, <lb/>
if men will but scruple it. We answer, Things in themselves necessary, <lb/>
or commanded by God, must be commanded by man, because<lb/>
scruples make them not unnecessary, and make not void the Laws <lb/>
of God, and it will be a sin even to the scrupulous to disobey: <lb/>
But things dispensible, and of themselves unnecessary, should not <lb/>
be rigorously urged upon him, to him they would be a sin, and <lb/>
cause of condemnation. It is in case of things indifferent in your <lb/>
own judgement, that we now speak. If it be said, that is humour, <lb/>
pride, or singularity, or <normalised orig="peevishnesse" auto="true">peevishness</normalised>, or faction, and not true <normalised orig="tendernesse" auto="true">tenderness</normalised> <lb/>
of Conscience that <normalised orig="causeth" auto="true">causes</normalised> the doubts, or non-conformity <lb/>
of these men. We answer, such crimes must be fastened only on the <lb/>
Individuals, that are first proved guilty of them; and not upon <lb/>
multitudes: unnamed and unknown and without proof; and you <lb/>
know it is the prerogative of God to search the heart, and that <lb/>
he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> said, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 7.1-2">Judge not that <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> be not judged, for with what judgement <lb/>
<normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> judge, <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> shall be judged, and with what measure <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> <normalised orig="mete" auto="true">meat</normalised>, it shall <lb/>
be measured to you again.</quote> Mat. 7. 1, 2. And <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 14.4">who art thou that <normalised orig="judgest" auto="true">judge</normalised> <lb/>
another mans servant, to his own Master, he <normalised orig="standeth" auto="true">stands</normalised> or <normalised orig="falleth" auto="true">falls</normalised>; yea, he<lb/>
shall be holden up, for God is able to make him stand.</quote> Rom. 14. 4. And <lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
who can pretend to be better acquainted with their hearts, than <lb/>
they are themselves! <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 2.11">For what man <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> the things of a man, save <lb/>
the Spirit of a man, which is in him</quote>, 1 Cor.2.11. And they are ready <lb/>
to appeal to the <normalised orig="dreadfull" auto="true">dreadful</normalised> God, the searcher of hearts, and the hater <lb/>
of <normalised orig="hypocrisie" auto="true">hypocrisy</normalised>, that if it were not for fear of sinning against him, <lb/>
and wounding their Consciences, and hazarding, and hindering <lb/>
their salvation, they would readily obey you in all these things; <lb/>
That it is their fear of sin and damnation that is their Impediment, <lb/>
they are ready to give you all the assurance, that man can give by <lb/>
the solemnest professions, or by oath if justly called to it. <lb/>
And one might think that a little charity might suffice to enable <lb/>
you to believe them, when their <normalised orig="non-complyance" auto="false">noncompliance</normalised> brings them under <lb/>
suffering, and their <normalised orig="complyance" auto="true">compliance</normalised>, is the visible way to savour, <lb/>
safety, and prosperity in the world. And if men that thus appeal to <lb/>
God concerning the intention of their own hearts, cannot be believed, <lb/>
even when the State of their worldly interest bears witness <lb/>
to their professions, but another shall step into the Throne of the <lb/>
heart-searching God, and say [It is not as they say, or swear, It is <lb/>
not Conscience, but obstinacy or singularity] all humane converse <lb/>
upon these terms will be overthrown: And what remedy have <lb/>
they, but patiently to wait till God that they have Appealed to, <lb/>
shall decide the doubt, and <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> who were the Assertours of truth <lb/>
or <normalised orig="falshood" auto="true">falsehood</normalised>. <lb/>
6. And we crave leave to represent to you the great disproportion, <lb/>
in necessity and worth, between the things in question, and <lb/>
the salvation of so many, as may be obtained by the free and <lb/>
<normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> exercise of the <normalised orig="Ministery" auto="true">Ministry</normalised>, of those that now are, and that <lb/>
are yet like to be laid aside; Do you think the Lord that died for <lb/>
souls, and <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> sent us to learn what that <normalised orig="meaneth" auto="true">means</normalised> [<quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 9.13">I will have mercy <lb/>
and not sacrifice</quote>, Mat. 9. 13]a is better pleased with Re-ordination, <lb/>
Subscription and Ceremonies, than with the saving of souls, by <lb/>
the means of his own appointment: If it be said that <normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised> order <lb/>
and peace and concord to promote the salvation of many, and <lb/>
therefore are to be preferred before the salvation of fewer. We <lb/>
answer, Concord in holy obedience to God <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> indeed promote <lb/>
the salvation of all that entertain it; but Concord in Ceremonies, <lb/>
or Re-ordination, or Oaths of obedience to Diocesans, or in your <lb/>
questioned particular forms of Prayer, do neither in their nature, <lb/>
or by <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> of any promise of God, so much conduce to <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> <lb/>
salvation; as the preaching of the Gospel <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised>, by able <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> <lb/>
and laborious Ministers. And how comes it to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> that unity, concord <lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
and order must be placed in those things, which are no way<lb/>
necessary thereto! Will there not be order and concord in Holy <lb/>
obedience and acceptable worshipping of God, on the terms which <lb/>
we now propose and crave, without the <normalised orig="foresaid" auto="true">aforesaid</normalised> matter of offence?<lb/>
We here <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> you that we are no Enemies to order, and <lb/>
our long importunity for the means of concord, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> that we<lb/>
are no Enemies to concord.<lb/>
If it be said, that other men that will conform to the things in <lb/>
question may convert and save souls better than those that are factious <lb/>
and disobedient: We first humbly crave that reproach may <lb/>
not be added to affliction, and that none may be called factious <lb/>
that are not proved such; and that Laws imposing things indifferent <lb/>
in your Judgement, and <normalised orig="sinfull" auto="true">sinful</normalised> in theirs, may not be made <lb/>
the rule to judge of faction: but that men who live inoffensively <lb/>
under Civil Government, and in matters of Faith and Worship, <lb/>
subscribe to all contained in the Holy Scriptures; and endeavour to <lb/>
promote universal Peace and Charity on these <normalised orig="termes" auto="true">terms</normalised>, may not <lb/>
be made offenders by the making of Laws and Canons, that must <lb/>
force them to be such: Consequently Daniel was an offender that <lb/>
would not forbear praying openly by the space of thirty <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised>. But <lb/>
antecedently to that Law, he was confessed just, by them that <lb/>
said [<quote type="biblical" ana="Dan 6.5">Wee shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we <lb/>
find it against him concerning the Law of his God</quote>] Dan. 6, 5, 7, IG. <lb/>
The Law which he must break was made to make him a breaker of <lb/>
that Law; take away that Law and take away his fault. We accuse <lb/>
none of the like intentions, but we must say, that it is <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> to make <lb/>
any man an offender, by making Laws which his Conscience will not <lb/>
allow to observe, and its as <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> to make that same man cease to <lb/>
seem disobedient, obstinate or factious, without any change at <lb/>
all in him, by taking down such <normalised orig="needlesse" auto="true">needless</normalised> Laws. We may again <lb/>
remember you what Christ a second time <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <normalised orig="presse" auto="true">press</normalised>, Mat.12.7. <lb/>
[<quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 12.7">But if <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> had known what this <normalised orig="meaneth" auto="true">means</normalised>, I will have mercy, and not <lb/>
sacrifice, <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> would not have condemned the guiltless.</quote>] <lb/>
And next, to the rest of the Objection, we answer; That sad <lb/>
experience tells the world, that if the Ministers that we are pleading <lb/>
for, be laid aside, there are not competent men enough to <lb/>
supply their Rooms, and equally to promote the salvation of the <lb/>
flocks: This is acknowledged by them who still give it as the reason <lb/>
why Ministers are not to be trusted with the expressing of their desires <lb/>
in their own words, nor so much as to <normalised orig="chuse" auto="true">choose</normalised> which Chapter to <lb/>
read, as well as which Text to preach on, to their <normalised orig="Auditours" auto="true">Auditors</normalised>, because <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="8">B</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
we shall have Ministers so weak, as to be unfit for such a <lb/>
trust: and men that are not wise enough for so <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> a part of their <lb/>
duty, as to choose fit portions of Scripture to read, are unlikely to <lb/>
afford an equal assistance to the salvation of the people instead of <lb/>
the labours of such as we are speaking for. <lb/>
7. And it must be <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised> that in our Ordination, we must <lb/>
<normalised orig="professe" auto="true">profess</normalised> that [we are perswaded that the holy Scriptures contain <lb/>
sufficiently all Doctrine, required of necessity for eternal salvation, <lb/>
&amp;c.] and that we will teach or maintain nothing as required <lb/>
of necessity to eternal salvation, but that which we are <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> <lb/>
may be concluded and proved by the same] and that one of the <lb/>
articles of the Church <normalised orig="containeth" auto="true">contains</normalised> the same <normalised orig="doctrin" auto="true">doctrine</normalised> of the scriptures <lb/>
sufficiency: and to these we are called to subscribe; And the persons <lb/>
that we now speak for, are ready to subscribe to all contained <lb/>
in the Holy Scriptures, and willing to be obliged by the <lb/>
Laws of men to practise it: and he that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> all things <normalised orig="necessarie" auto="true">necessary</normalised><lb/>
to salvation is received of God, and should therefore be received <lb/>
by the Church, if the Apostles argument be good, Rom. 14. 1. 3. <lb/>
[<quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 14.3">for God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> received him</quote>] seeing then you do profess that none <lb/>
of your Impositions that cannot be concluded from the Scripture, <lb/>
are necessary to salvation, let them not consequentially be made<lb/>
necessary to it, and more necessary than that which is ordinarily <lb/>
necessary. <lb/>
If you say, that so many men shall be forbidden to preach, <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> <lb/>
they dare Subscribe and use these things; you will tempt them <lb/>
to infer, that preaching being ordinarily necessary to salvation, Rom.10.14. <lb/>
And these things called indifferent being made necessary to <lb/>
preaching and preferred before it, therefore they are made necessary <lb/>
to salvation, and preferred before that which God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> made necessary. <lb/>
If it be said, that this will as much follow the making of any <lb/>
other indifferent thing to be necessary to preaching, and so the <lb/>
Church shall make no orders; We answer. <lb/>
1. That smaller things must not be imposed by unproportionable <lb/>
penalties. <lb/>
2. That though the Church may prefer a sober, peaceable <lb/>
Preacher before one that is Schismatical and unpeaceable (which <lb/>
is not at all to exclude Preaching) yet the Church may not make <lb/>
any thing necessary to preaching it self; that is of it self unnecessary, <lb/>
and not antecedently necessary, at least by accident. <lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
8. And if our Religion be laid upon your particular Liturgy, we <lb/>
shall teach the Papists further to insult, by asking us, where was <lb/>
our Religion two hundred years ago? The Common-Prayer-Book <lb/>
as differing from the <normalised orig="Masse-Book" auto="false">mass-book</normalised>, being not so old, and that which <lb/>
might then be the matter of a change, is not so unchangeable it <lb/>
self, but that those Alterations may be accepted for ends so desirable <lb/>
as are now before us. <lb/>
9. And we humbly crave that we may not in this be more rigorously <lb/>
dealt with, than the Pastors and People of the <normalised orig="Antient" auto="true">Ancient</normalised><lb/>
Churches were: If we may not have the Liberty of the Primitive <lb/>
times, when for ought can be proved, no Liturgical Forms were <lb/>
imposed upon any Church, yet at least let us have the liberty of the <lb/>
following Ages, when under the same Prince there were diversity of <lb/>

                  </choice>, and particular Pastors, had the power of making and <lb/>
altering them for their particular Churches. <lb/>
10. And if you should reject (which God forbid) the moderate <lb/>
proposals which now and formerly we have made, we humbly <lb/>
crave leave to offer it to your consideration, what Judgement all <lb/>
the Protestant Churches are likely to pass on your proceedings, and <lb/>
how your Cause and ours will stand represented to them, and to all <lb/>
succeeding Ages. Though we earnestly desire the <normalised orig="tolleration" auto="true">toleration</normalised> of <lb/>
those that are <normalised orig="tollerable" auto="true">tolerable</normalised>, and the peaceable Liberties of all that <lb/>
agree on the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> terms of Primitive Simplicity, in Doctrine, <lb/>
Worship and Discipline, yet have we our selves so far drawn near <lb/>
you, as that the world will say, you reject those that are for Episcopacy <lb/>
it self, and set Forms of Liturgy, and are not so much as <lb/>
charged by you at all, as disagreeing in any point of Faith, if you <lb/>
shall reject us. If after our <choice ana="illegible">

(we mean such as Reverend Bishop Hall, and Usher) who have <lb/>

to our Fraternal Unity and Peace. If you would not grant this Liberty, <lb/>
and Communion to others, with whom Christ will hold <lb/>
Communion in grace and glory; yet it will appear more strange to <lb/>
the world, that you should cast out the Episcopal also, that dare <lb/>
not go beyond the Rule of Holy Scripture, and the Example of Primitive <lb/>
Simplicity.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="10">B2</fw>

                  <lb/>
And we doubt not but you know, how new and strange a thing <lb/>
it is that you require in the point of Re-ordination: When a Canon <lb/>
amongst those called the Apostles <normalised orig="deposeth" auto="true">deposes</normalised> those that re-ordain, <lb/>
and that are re-ordained; And when it is a thing that both Papists &amp; <lb/>
Protestants condemn, when not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> the former Bishops of England, <lb/>
that were more moderate were against it, but even the most <lb/>
fervent adversaries of the Presbyterian way; such as Bishop Bancroft <lb/>
himself, how strange must it needs seem to the Reformed <lb/>
Churches, to the whole Christian world, and to future Generations, <lb/>
that so many able, <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> Ministers should be laid by as broken <lb/>
Vessels, because they dare not be re-ordained? and that so many <lb/>
have been put upon so new and so generally dis-relished a thing? <lb/>
11. And we crave leave to remember you, that the Holy Ghost <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> commanded you to over-see the flock, not by constraint, but <lb/>
willingly, not as being Lords over Gods heritage, but as Ensamples <lb/>
to the Flock: And that it is not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> more comfortable to your <lb/>
selves to be loved as the Fathers, than to be esteemed the Afflicters <lb/>
of the Church, but that it is <normalised orig="needfull" auto="true">needful</normalised> to the ends of your Ministry <lb/>
for the people: When you are loved, your Doctrine will more <lb/>
easily be received: But when men think that their souls or liberties <lb/>
are endangered by you, its <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> to judge how much they are like <lb/>
to profit by you. <lb/>
12. And you know if we are not in point of Ceremonies or <lb/>
Forms in every thing of your mind; it is no more strange to have <lb/>
variety of intellectual Apprehensions in the same <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> and <lb/>
Church, than variety of temperatures and degrees of age &amp; strength. <lb/>
If His Majesty should <normalised orig="expell" auto="true">expel</normalised> all those from his Dominions, that are <lb/>
not so wise, as solidly to judge, whether the Liturgy as before, or as <lb/>
thus reformed, be the best, yea whether this be <normalised orig="intollerable" auto="true">intolerable</normalised> in <lb/>
comparison of yours, and whether God be pleased or displeased <lb/>
with your Ceremonies, it would be too great a diminution of his <lb/>
subjects, and if you should turn all such out of the <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> of <lb/>
Christ, it would be liker a dissipating, than a gathering, and a <lb/>
destroying, than an edifying of his Church. And you have not your <lb/>
power to destruction, but to edification, 2 Cor.10.8 &amp; 13.10. <lb/>
you must do all things for the Peoples edifying, 2 Cor. 12. 19. Ephes.4. 12.<lb/>
13: And how Christ will take it of you, to cast out from the Ministry<lb/>
or Communion of the Church, or to grieve and punish all <lb/>
those that dare not conform to you in these matters; for fear of <lb/>
displeasing the Law-giver of the Church, we beseech you judge <lb/>

passages, how Christ will take it, to have his servants not only not-visited,<lb/>
not-relieved, but to be afflicted, not only in body, but in <lb/>
soul, with that great affliction to be cast out of the Ministry, or <lb/>
Church, for an unavoidable dissent in things indifferent, you will <lb/>
never <normalised orig="joyn" auto="true">join</normalised> with those that shall stretch forth a hand against them for <lb/>
such a cause as this. If yet the old pretence be made, that they suffer <lb/>
as <normalised orig="Schismaticks" auto="true">Schismatics</normalised>, and disobedient; we must say again, if any shall <lb/>
make men disobedient by imposing things unnecessary, which they <lb/>
know are by learned, pious, peaceable men, esteemed sins against <lb/>
the Lord, and then shall thus heavily afflict them for the disobedience <lb/>
which they may easily cure by the forbearance of those impositions; <lb/>
let not our souls come into their secret, nor our honour <lb/>
be united to their Assembly: If they shall smite or cast out a supposed <lb/>
<normalised orig="Schismatick" auto="true">Schismatic</normalised>, and Christ shall find an able, holy, peaceable <lb/>
Minister, or other Christian, wounded, or mourning, out of doors, <lb/>
let us not be found among the Actors, nor stand among them in <lb/>

to the Troublers of believers, 2 <normalised orig="Thes" auto="true">These</normalised>. 1 6. <lb/>
14. We beseech you also to consider, that men have not their <lb/>
understandings at their own command; much <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> can they be <lb/>
commanded by others, if they were never so willing to believe all <lb/>
that is imposed on them to be <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised>, they cannot therefore believe <lb/>
it, because they would, the intellect being not free. And to <lb/>
dissemble, and say, and swear, and do, the things which they believe <lb/>
not, is such an aggravated <normalised orig="hypocrisie" auto="true">hypocrisy</normalised> (being in the matters of <lb/>
God, and <normalised orig="joyned" auto="true">joined</normalised> with perfidiousness) as we may suppose cannot <lb/>
render them acceptable to any, that have not renounced Religion <lb/>
and Humanity, much less should they be constrained to it. And <lb/>
when it is known that <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> judgements are against the things imposed, <lb/>
and that penalties are no means adapted to the informing <lb/>
and changing of the judgement; but to force men to do the things <lb/>
they know, we conceive they should not be used, and so used in <lb/>
the case of things indifferent, where they are not necessary to the <lb/>
common good, and where the sufferers, have never had sufficient <lb/>
means to change their judgements. <lb/>
If it be said, that it is their own fault, that their judgements are <lb/>
not changed, and that the means have been sufficient. <lb/>
We answer, That it is their fault, is the point in question, which <lb/>

and as it is their fault that they are not all of the highest <lb/>

men must be cast out of the Church, or Ministry, because they are <lb/>
not wiser than such learned men, as the Pastors of the most of the <lb/>

And if it be said, that men do willingly keep out the light. We <lb/>

being vilified as <normalised orig="Schismaticks" auto="true">Schismatics</normalised>, and undone; and when men profess <lb/>
before the Lord, that they do impartially study and pray for knowledge, <lb/>
and would gladly know the will of God at the dearest rate; <lb/>
we must again say, that those men must prove that they know the <lb/>
dissenters hearts, better than they are known to themselves, that <lb/>
expect to be believed by charitable Christians, when they charge <lb/>
them with <normalised orig="wilfull" auto="true">wilful</normalised> ignorance, or obstinate resisting of the truth. <lb/>
15. And we crave leave to ask whether you do not your selves in <lb/>
some things mistake, or may not do so for ought you know? and <lb/>
whether your understandings are not still imperfect, and all men <lb/>
differ not in some opinions or other? And if you may mistake in <lb/>
any thing, may it not be in as great things as these? can it be expected, <lb/>
that we should all be past erring <choice ana="illegible">

17. But nothing more <normalised orig="affecteth" auto="true">affects</normalised> us, than to think of the Lamentable <lb/>
divisions, that have been caused and are still like to be, <lb/>
<normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> things unnecessary are so imposed: And on the contrary, <lb/>
how blessed an unity and peace we might enjoy if these occasions <lb/>
of division were removed, and we might but have leave to serve <lb/>
God as his Apostles did. As in Doctrinals, ten thousand will sooner <lb/>
agree in an <normalised orig="explicite" auto="true">explicit</normalised> belief of the Creed, than an hundred in an <lb/>
<normalised orig="explicite" auto="true">explicit</normalised> belief of all that Ockam or Scotus have determined; So <lb/>
in the matters of Government and worship; It is easier to agree <lb/>
upon few things, than upon many, upon great and certain and necessary <lb/>
things, than upon small uncertain and unnecessary things, <lb/>
and upon things that God himself <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> revealed or appointed, <lb/>
than upon things that proceed from no surer an Original, than the <lb/>
wit or will of man. The strict prohibition of adding to or the diminishing <lb/>
from the things commanded by the Law-giver of the <lb/>
Church, Deut. 12. 32. <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> put such a fear in the minds of multitudes <lb/>
of the loyal subjects of Christ, lest by such additions or diminutions <lb/>
in the matters of his worship, they should provoke him to <lb/>
displeasure, as will be a certain perpetual hindrance to any common <lb/>
unity or Concord, in such humane impositions, of which many <lb/>
of the servants of the jealous God will have a continual <normalised orig="jealousie" auto="true">jealousy</normalised>. <lb/>
With grieved hearts we now renew the lamentable divisions, <lb/>
occasioned already by these impositions, ever since the Reformation <lb/>
in the <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> of K. Edward 6th. and the grievous fruits of those <lb/>
Divisions! How they destroyed Charity (the characters of Christs <lb/>
Disciples) and exasperated <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> minds against each other: How <lb/>
they corrupted <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> prayers and other exercises of devotions, and <lb/>
made them pray and preach against one another: How their tongues <lb/>
were <normalised orig="emboldned" auto="true">emboldened</normalised> to the censuring of each other, one party calling <lb/>
the other Factious, Schismatical, Singular, and Disobedient; and   <lb/>
the other calling them Antichristian, Proud, Tyrannical, Superstitious, <lb/>
Persecutors and Formalists: And such language still increasing <lb/>
the uncharitableness and divisions; till the increase of <lb/>
imposing rigour on the one side, &amp; of impatience under Sufferings <lb/>
on the other side, was too great a preparation to those greater calamities <lb/>
which are yet bitter to the remembrance of all whose interests <lb/>
or passions have not Conquered their humanity. And the <lb/>
continuance of so much of the causes and effects, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> infallibly <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="15">14</fw>

                  <lb/>
prove that if the same impositions be <normalised orig="setled" auto="true">settled</normalised> upon us, the same Heart-divisions <lb/>
will be still continued: Brethren will disdain the name <lb/>
and love of Brethren to each other; which yet Christ himself by <lb/>
<normalised orig="condiscending" auto="true">condescending</normalised> and reproving love, <normalised orig="vouchsafeth" auto="true">vouchsafes</normalised> to them all. Instead <lb/>
of loving one another with a pure heart, fervently, there will <lb/>
be, if not hating, yet grudging at one another, censuring and <lb/>
                  <choice ana="typeset-error">

and make one side think, that they are necessitated to be more rigorous <lb/>
in their Coercions, and the other think that they are allowed <lb/>
to be more censorious against those by whom they suffer. <lb/>
And how many thousands on both sides by such a stream of <lb/>
temptations, will undoubtedly be carried on in a course of Sin <lb/>
from day to day, and by heart sin, and tongue sin, by Pulpit sins, <lb/>
or sins in other part of Worship, will dishonour God and provoke <lb/>
him to indignation against them and the Land, we may not without <lb/>
astonishment and grief of heart foresee or foretell. <lb/>
And its <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> to foresee how the innocent will be <normalised orig="numbred" auto="true">numbered</normalised> with <lb/>
the faulty, and those that do but feel their sufferings, and the sufferings <lb/>
of the Church on these occasions, and do but groan and <lb/>
sigh to God, and pray for succour and deliverance, will be <lb/>
thought to be guilty of discontent and faction, and bringing the <lb/>
Government of the Church, and consequently of the <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> into <lb/>
hatred or dislike, and so their sufferings will be increased: And <lb/>

seem to any mis-understanding, or suspicious, or malicious hearers, <lb/>
to intimate any sense of sufferings, will be carried to the ears of Rulers, <lb/>
and represented as a crime? And nature having planted in all <lb/>
men an unwillingness to suffer, and <normalised orig="denyed" auto="true">denied</normalised> to all men a love of calamity, <lb/>
and necessitated men to feel when they are hurt, and made <lb/>
the tongue and countenance the Index of our sense; these Effects <lb/>
will be unavoidable, while such Impositions are continued, and <lb/>
while a fear of sinning will not suffer men to swallow and digest <lb/>
them, and what wrong such divisions about religion will be to the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised>, and to His Majesty, we shall not mention, because our <lb/>
<normalised orig="Governours" auto="true">Governors</normalised> themselves may better understand it. <lb/>
On the other side, what universal ease, and peace, and joy, <lb/>
would be the fruits of that happy unity and concord, which the reasonable <lb/>
forbearances which we humbly petition for, would certainly <lb/>

when we had no such temptations, burdens, or disquietments? <lb/>
When we lay not under the Reproofs of Conscience, nor the suspicions <lb/>

without distraction, and be among his servants without such fears, <lb/>
(Phil. 1. 14. 1 Cor. 16. 10.) How much would the hands of the <lb/>
Builders be strengthened for the work of God, when they speak <lb/>
the same things, and there are no divisions among them, but they <lb/>
are perfectly <normalised orig="joyned" auto="true">joined</normalised> together in the same mind and judgement, <lb/>
1 Cor. 1. 10. when they are like-minded, having the same love, being <lb/>
of one accord, of one mind, doing nothing through strife or <lb/>
vain glory, which will never be while the one calls the other factious <lb/>
and schismatical, and the other <normalised orig="calleth" auto="true">calls</normalised> him superstitious and tyranical; <lb/>
but when Christ <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> taught us in lowliness of mind to esteem <lb/>
others better than our selves, and not to look every man on his own <lb/>
things (his own gifts, and virtues, and worth, and interest) but every <lb/>

Hope, the Lord, the Faith, the Baptism, the God and Father of all <lb/>
<normalised orig="Beleevers" auto="true">Believers</normalised>, which are one, if we were one among our selves, which <lb/>
will never be till with lowliness, and meekness, and long-suffering, <lb/>
we forbear one another in love, instead of hating, reviling and persecuting <lb/>
one another; and till we endeavour to keep the unity of <lb/>
the Spirit (though given in various degrees) rather than an unity <lb/>
in unnecessary things) in the bond of peace, Ephes. 4. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, <lb/>

and tearing it self into pieces, because of our different measure of <lb/>

celebrated, if we had all laid by, the unchristian Spirit of hatred, <lb/>

Church or Ministry, on the account of things indifferent, we received <lb/>
one another, as Christ received us to the glory of God, Rom. <lb/>
15. 1, 2, 6, 7. and till we are thus like-minded one towards another; <lb/>
according to Christ Jesus, <normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>. 5. instead of being selfishly <lb/>
minded as men, or maliciously as enemies (1 Cor. 3.3. 1 Cor 14.<lb/>
20. Col. 3. 8. Titus 3. 3.) If the very Babes were fed with the sincere <lb/>
Milk of the Word, and all malice, and guile, and <normalised orig="hypocrisie" auto="true">hypocrisy</normalised>, <lb/>
and envies, and evil-speaking were laid aside, it would prove the best <lb/>
way to their growth, and a surer way to your present and eternal <lb/>
peace, than casting them out because they cannot bear your burdens, <lb/>
or digest some unnecessary things, 1 Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3. How good and <lb/>
how happy a thing would it be for Brethren to dwell together in <lb/>
unity? (<normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 133. 1.) And as those that by one Spirit are <normalised orig="baptized" auto="true">baptised</normalised> <lb/>
into one body, and know they have need of one another, to contribute <lb/>
honour to the parts that lack it; yea to bestow more abundant <lb/>
honour upon those members which we think to be less honourable, <lb/>
and more abundant <normalised orig="comliness" auto="true">comeliness</normalised>, on the uncomely parts, as knowing <lb/>
those members are necessary that seem to be more feeble. If indeed <lb/>
we would have no Schism in the body, the natural way is, for the <lb/>
members to have the same care one for another, as suffering all <lb/>
with one that <normalised orig="suffereth" auto="true">suffers</normalised>, and <normalised orig="rejoycing" auto="true">rejoicing</normalised> all with one that‚Äôs honoured, <lb/>
1 Cor. 12. 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. Take their sufferings as <lb/>
your own, and you will not be hasty to bring them unto suffering. It <lb/>
must be the Primitive Simplicity of Faith, Worship, and Discipline, <lb/>
that must restore the Primitive Charity, Unity, and Peace, and make <lb/>
the multitude of <normalised orig="Beleevers" auto="true">Believers</normalised> to be of one heart, and of one soul, and <lb/>
to converse with gladness and singleness of heart, as having all <lb/>
things common, Act. 4.32. &amp; 2.46. No such things as our controverted <lb/>
Impositions, were then made necessary to the unity and <lb/>
concord of the members of the Church. <lb/>
18. And we humbly offer to your consideration, which way will <lb/>
most <normalised orig="gratifie" auto="true">gratify</normalised> Satan in his cause and servants, and which will most <lb/>

glad to see so many of them suffer, and glad under the shelter of <lb/>
your displeasure and afflictings, to find opportunity to reproach <lb/>
them, and add affliction to affliction. The common adversaries of <lb/>

<normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised>, and by promoting the Gospel and <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> of the <lb/>
Lord. And whether this will tend to the edification of the Saints, <lb/>
and the pleasing of Christ, we have inquired before. <lb/>
19. And if what you stand for be indeed of God, this course of <lb/>
<normalised orig="unmercifull" auto="true">unmerciful</normalised> imposition, is the greatest wrong to it, that you can easily <lb/>
be drawn to, <normalised orig="unawars" auto="false">unawares</normalised>; while so many truly fearing God, are <lb/>

others we should think it our duty, that none of us put a stumbling <lb/>

those that esteem that unclean which we do not, we walk not charitably; <lb/>

that Kingdom <normalised orig="consisteth" auto="true">consists</normalised> not in meat or drink, but in righteousness, <lb/>

If you say, Rulers imposition <normalised orig="maketh" auto="true">makes</normalised> indifferent things cease to <lb/>
be indifferent? We answer. <lb/>
1. They are not indifferent in the judgement of Dissenters<lb/>
though they be so in yours. <lb/>
2. Paul was a Ruler of the Church himself, and yet would deny <lb/>
his own Liberty, rather than offend the weak, so far was he <lb/>
from taking away the liberty of others: 1 Cor. 8. 13. And it is to <lb/>
the Church of Rome and Corinth, and so the Pastors as well as the <lb/>
rest, that Paul thus <normalised orig="writeth" auto="true">writes</normalised>; We beseech you therefore plead not <lb/>
Law against us, when our request is that you will <normalised orig="joyn" auto="true">join</normalised> with us, in <lb/>
Petitioning, to his Majesty, and the Parliament, that there may <lb/>
be no such Law. <lb/>
The Apostles and Elders, Act. 15. 28. declare unto the Churches, <lb/>
that it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and them, to lay upon them, <lb/>
no greater burden, than necessary things; imposing them because <lb/>
antecedently necessary (for that is given as the reason, of their selection, <lb/>
and imposition) and not only making unnecessary things, <lb/>
necessary, by imposition, for then the Imposition had been unnecessary, <lb/>
though it was not a simple unchangeable necessity, yet <lb/>
it was a necessity by accident, pro tempore &amp; loco; antecedent to <lb/>
the imposition of that Assembly. Seeing then such things commend <lb/>
us not to God, and if you use them, at least, you are not the better. <lb/>
Sin not against Christ, by sinning against your Brethren, 1 Cor. 8. 8,<lb/>
9, 11, 12. much more take heed of forcing them to sin. <lb/>
We have presumed to be thus plain and large, in <normalised orig="shewing" auto="true">showing</normalised> you <lb/>
some of our Reasons, for your consent, to the necessary abatement, <lb/>
of things unnecessary to the Consciences of your Brethren. <lb/>
In the conclusion, we beseech you to compare with these the <lb/>
Reasons, that can move you to deny us these requests. If you will<lb/>
needs use such things your selves, will it gain you so much to<lb/>
force them upon others, as will answer all the <normalised orig="foresaid" auto="true">aforesaid</normalised> Inconveniences? <lb/>
Will it cost you as dear to grant this Liberty, or abate <lb/>
these things, as the Imposition will cost your Brethren and you? O <lb/>
how easily, how safely, how cheaply, yea, with what commodity and <lb/>
                  <pb n="19"/>
                  <lb/>
delight, may you now make this Nation happy, in granting your <lb/>
Brethren these requests? <lb/>
If you say that others will be still unsatisfied, and you shall never <lb/>
know when you have done: We answer, <lb/>
1. The cause of the Non-conformists <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been long ago stated, <lb/>
at the troubles at Frank-ford, and having continued still the same, <lb/>
you have no reason to suspect them of any considerable change. <lb/>
2. Grant us but the freedom that Christ and his Apostles left <lb/>
unto the Churches; use necessary things, as necessary, and unnecessary, <lb/>
as unnecessary, and charitably bear with the infirmities of <lb/>
the weak, and tolerate the tolerable, while they live peaceably, <lb/>
and then you will know when you have done. And for the intolerable, <lb/>
we beg not your Toleration: We intercede for those that <lb/>
have Christ for their Intercessor in the Highest: We know when <lb/>
all‚Äôs done, there will be Heresies. 1 Cor. 11. 19. <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Tim 3.2-5">There will be selflovers, <lb/>

things necessary to Salvation; and the common union of Believers, <lb/>
and that you are like to see at Christs right hand, who will finally <lb/>
<normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> them, and take them to his glory. If you suppose us in all <lb/>
this to have Pleaded our own cause; We hope we are not such as <lb/>
are <normalised orig="intollerable" auto="true">intolerable</normalised> in the Ministry or communion of the Church: If <lb/>
you suppose us to Plead the cause of others, we hope you will accept <lb/>
our desires as impartial, when it is supposed the persons differ <lb/>
from us, as well as from you. We have now faithfully, and not <lb/>
unnecessarily, or unreasonably, spread before you the Case of thousands <lb/>
of the upright of the Land: We have proposed honest and <lb/>
safe remedies for our present distractions, and the preventing of <lb/>
the feared increase. We humbly beg your Favourable Interpretation <lb/>
of our plain and earnest language, which the urgency of the<lb/>
Cause commands, and your consent to these our necessary requests: <lb/>
which if you grant us, you will engage us to thankfulness to God <lb/>
and you, and to <normalised orig="imploy" auto="true">employ</normalised> our faculties and interests with Alacrity <lb/>
                  <pb n="20"/>
                  <lb/>
to assist you for the common peace. But if you reject our suit <lb/>
(which God forbid) We shall commit all to him that <normalised orig="judgeth" auto="true">judges</normalised> <lb/>
Righteously, and wait in hope for the Blessed day of Universal <lb/>
Judgement, when the Lord of Hosts their strong Redeemer shall <lb/>
<normalised orig="throughly" auto="true">thoroughly</normalised> plead his peoples Cause, and execute Judgement for <lb/>
them, and bring them forth into the light, and they shall behold <lb/>
his <normalised orig="Righteousnesse" auto="true">Righteousness</normalised>. In the mean time, we will bear the indignation <lb/>
of the Lord, because we have sinned against him. Come Lord <lb/>
Jesus! Come quickly, Amen.<lb/>
