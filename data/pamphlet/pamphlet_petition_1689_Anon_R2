and Clergy of the Province of Canterbury, to be <lb/>
Assembled in Convocation at Westminster, A.D. 1690. <lb/>
The humble Petition of many Divines, and others of the <lb/>
Classical Congregational, and other <normalised orig="Perswasions" auto="true">Persuasions</normalised>, in the <lb/>
Name of themselves, and Brethren both of Old England <lb/>
and New, who have born Witness to the Truth in the <lb/>

               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Humbly <normalised orig="Sheweth" auto="true">Shows</normalised>,<lb/>
THat your Petitioners, being men of tender Consciences, could not <lb/>
submit to the severe, and unlawful impositions in matters Ecclesiastical, <lb/>
forced upon them by A.B. Laud and his Party; who, under <lb/>
pretence of establishing Uniformity in the Worship, and Service of <lb/>
God, introduced several Rites and Ceremonies, which seemed to us repugnant <lb/>
to our Christian Liberty, and border’d as we judged, upon Popish Superstition, <lb/>
and therefore thought it our duty to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> our Zeal for the true <lb/>
Protestant Religion, which we saw very much endanger’d, not only in private <lb/>
Conferences and Meetings, but in Sermons and Lectures here in London, and <lb/>
in the Market Towns in the Country: for which some of us were put in <lb/>
the Pillory, and branded for <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>Sedi*ious</sic>
                     <corr>Seditious</corr>
                  </choice> Preachers and Libellers, others forced <lb/>
away to New England, and Holland (the great and sure Refuge and Sanctuary <lb/>
of the distressed people of God) and our fears being afterwards justly increased <lb/>
by the favour <normalised orig="shewn" auto="true">shown</normalised> to the Papists at Court, as we were made to <lb/>
believe; and to three or four Popish Priests, who after sentence of Condemnation, <lb/>
were rescued from the Justice of the Nation, by the powerful Interposition <lb/>
of the Queen; who had also <join original="procur’d"><normalised orig="procurd" auto="false">procured</normalised></join> leave for two or three Nuncio’s <lb/>
(as they were called) to come from Rome, and reside here, their business <lb/>
being, as it was cunningly given out, only to make a Complement to <lb/>
her from the great Antichrist, the Man of Sin, her unholy Father, the Pope, and <lb/>
to settle some <normalised orig="perplext" auto="true">perplexed</normalised> affairs depending between those of her Idolatrous <lb/>
Communion: So that we could not but be very sadly sensible of the horrid <lb/>
Consequences, that would have been unavoidable, if a sudden check and stop <lb/>
had not been put to such Communications, Designs and Consults. And <lb/>
whereas much about the same time, our Civil Rights and Liberties were invaded <lb/>
by the Illegal Tax of Ship-money, (notwithstanding all the Judges of <lb/>
Westminster have given it under their hands, after mature deliberation and <lb/>
debate, that the King might lawfully levy it in case of Necessity, of which <lb/>

he was to be the Judge; and that one <normalised orig="Noy" auto="true">No</normalised>, a Mercenary Lawyer, had made <lb/>
a Collection of Precedents, from several <normalised orig="Authentick" auto="true">Authentic</normalised> Records, to <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> the <lb/>
practice of it) we thought our selves indispensably obliged in Conscience, to <lb/>
advise all true Englishmen to stand upon their Guard, and not suffer either <lb/>
their <choice ana="print-error">

                     <corr>Liberties</corr>
                  </choice> or their Properties to be Ravaged out of their hands. And <lb/>
soon after, when the blessed Parliament was called in November 40. at which <lb/>
time they were necessitated to take up Arms in the defence of the Kingdom; <lb/>
we Preached up, as it became us, the Lawfulness of the War then <join original="Commenc’d"><normalised orig="Commencd" auto="false">Commenced</normalised></join>, <lb/>
and Managed against the King, who, as we plainly saw, had abused <lb/>
the Trust reposed in him by the People, and had violated the Contract <lb/>
made with them at his Coronation, for which he stood accountable. And <lb/>
God having appear’d gloriously in behalf of us, and our righteous Cause in <lb/>
several <normalised orig="Battels" auto="true">Battles</normalised>, especially at Marston moor, and Naseby, whereby the strength <lb/>
of his party (so miraculous were the Dispensations of Providence in our favour) <lb/>
was totally defeated and broken. Upon which, within a very few <lb/>
years after, follow’d his <normalised orig="Tryal" auto="true">Trial</normalised> and Execution, and the utter Dissolution of <lb/>
the Monarchy, the Government for some time before having been resolved <lb/>
into the hands of the people, the Fountain and Original of it. And whereas, <lb/>
after the Death of that Glorious Instrument, his Highness O.P. by reason of <lb/>
our Disagreements, and want of Zeal and Conduct in defending and maintaining <lb/>
the Good old Cause, for which we at first so righteously engaged, as <lb/>
was our Common Interest to have done; a Restoration happened in the <lb/>
year 60. which overthrew all our designs, and destroy’d the Reformation, <lb/>
which we had made in Church and State, to our great regret, shame and <lb/>
confusion; our Doctrines and Positions being severely condemn’d, as pernicious <lb/>
and destructive of Monarchical Government, and as impious, unchristian, <lb/>
and damnable: And our Books and Sermons (such especially as were <lb/>
Preached before the Long Parliament) Censured, and the solemn League and Covenant<lb/>
burnt by the hands of the Common Hangman. Now to our great joy <lb/>
and amazement, we seeing what a Glorious Revolution has been brought <lb/>
about by his Highness P.O. his rescuing us out of the Jaws of Popery and Slavery, <lb/>
which could not possibly have been effected, if he had not been invited <lb/>
in by men, who were convinced of the truth, honesty, and lawfulness of <lb/>
our Principles, and by their going into him. And observing that your Lordships, <lb/>
and the major part of the Clergy, notwithstanding your former Opinions, <lb/>
Declarations, and Judgment, and your dislike of us and our Actions, <lb/>
and your Persecuting of us; and notwithstanding the repeated assurances, <lb/>
which you gave K. Charles and K. James, of your steady, unshaken, unalterable, <lb/>
unsophisticated Loyalty, have fallen upon, and made use of the same methods <lb/>
we did formerly, and have renounced your Faith and Allegiance to <lb/>
K. James, which you had so solemnly swore to him, his Heirs and lawful <lb/>
Successors, and have so readily and cheerfully taken the New Oaths, by <lb/>
which you approve and <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> all that was formerly done by us, and <lb/>
which has been done of late to bring about this blessed and glorious change: <lb/>
Our humble Petition, which we think and believe in our hearts and consciences, <lb/>
to be founded on the highest equity and reason imaginable, is, that <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
you make satisfaction to us for the Injuries and Reproaches, which we have <lb/>
endured, and that you help us again to our ears, and the blood that we <lb/>
have lost in the defence of the same Righteous Cause; and that you vindicate <lb/>
us, as well as your selves, from those horrid and scandalous Censures <lb/>
cast upon us most unchristianly; and that you set us right in the opinion of <lb/>
all Mankind, that we acted like honest, wise, zealous, true, and good Protestants, and <lb/>
<normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> spirited Patriots, in the defence, maintenance, and preservation of our Religion, <lb/>
Laws, Liberties, and Properties, and the fundamental Rights of the Subject. <lb/>
And we also further request and pray, that according to your present <lb/>
Judgment, which your practice and behaviour in the present conjunctures <lb/>
of affairs so clearly demonstrate; and the better to prevent the People <lb/>
from being missed by those wild and foolish opinions and fancies, which <lb/>
had of late so like to have ruin’d us; and from all thoughts of returning to <lb/>
their Allegiance to K. James, which some few <normalised orig="Malecontents" auto="true">Malcontents</normalised>, [who dare <lb/>
maintain, that you have Apostatized from the Faith and Doctrine of the Church of <lb/>
England, and that you are all more or less guilty of the damnable sin of Perjury, <lb/>
stiffly and obstinately pretend to be unconditional, <normalised orig="indefeisible" auto="true">indefeasible</normalised>, and no way <lb/>
forfeitable upon the pretence of Male-administration, Desertion, Abdication, want <lb/>
of Protection, and the like] and the better also to inform our neighbour Nations, <lb/>
and especially our dear Brethren and fellow Protestants, the Dutch, <lb/>
who were at so vast a charge for our Deliverance (tho both your Enemies <lb/>
and ours give out, that this Deliverance was the Master-piece of their <lb/>
High and Mighty Lordships Policy; they hereby throwing us upon a War <lb/>
with France, and in the mean while getting the Trade of the whole World, <lb/>
to the utter ruin of our Merchants and Seamen, and to the impovershing <lb/>
of the Nation; and ridding themselves of their Stat-holder) upon what <lb/>
just, sober, honest, and Religious Principles you have govern’d, and conducted <lb/>
your selves in this whole affair; that you will be pleased to enact, establish, <lb/>
<normalised orig="ratifie" auto="true">ratify</normalised>, and confirm by your Synodal Authority the following Propositions, <lb/>
as good and <normalised orig="wholsome" auto="true">wholesome</normalised> Doctrine, and no way disagreeable to the word of <lb/>
God, and as fit to be received and embraced by all such, as wish well to <lb/>
the true Protestant Religion, and the good of their Native Country. <lb/>
1. That the Doctrine of Non-resistance, by which injured Subjects are <lb/>
forbid to take up Arms against their Liege Lord and rightful <normalised orig="Soveraign" auto="true">Sovereign</normalised>, is a <lb/>
false and pernicious Doctrine; and that a forcible defence of the Subject against <lb/>
the Princes actual oppression of them (or upon a supposal, and just and probable <lb/>
fear that he will oppress them) is not only allowable but necessary; <lb/>
and that otherwise they will be wanting to their own preservation, which <lb/>
the Laws of God and Nature require. <lb/>
2. That the Primitive Christians, who lived before the time of Constantine, <lb/>
[who had the Law of Nature to plead in their behalf, which gave <choice ana="illegible">

and yet tamely gave up themselves into the hands of the bloody Roman Emperors <lb/>
(notwithstanding their numbers were so great, that they could not <lb/>
doubt of success and Victory) without so much as fighting one stroke, and <lb/>
suffering their Throats to be cut with their Swords in their hands, upon a <lb/>

those Christians much more, who lived in the times of Constantius, Julian, <lb/>

nice, weak, over-scrupulous, low-spirited fellows, who mistook the meaning <lb/>
of Peter and Paul in their Epistles, which they foolishly and ignorantly <lb/>
<normalised orig="alledged" auto="true">alleged</normalised> for the Cut throat Doctrine of Passive Obedience, and are no longer <lb/>
to be honour’d with the glorious Titles of Martyrs and <normalised orig="Confessours" auto="true">Confessors</normalised>, but deserve <lb/>
to be <join original="esteem’d"><normalised orig="esteemd" auto="false">esteemed</normalised></join> <normalised orig="Felo's" auto="false">Fellows</normalised> de <normalised orig="se" auto="true">see</normalised>, and betrayers of your Religion. <lb/>
3. That Necessity is above all forms and rules of Justice and Law, and <lb/>
that when a Nation is in danger by a Prince <join original="influenc’d"><normalised orig="influencd" auto="false">influenced</normalised></join> by evil Counsellors, <lb/>
Subjects may Lawfully enter into Leagues, Covenants, and Associations, notwithstanding <lb/>
all Sacramental <normalised orig="tyes" auto="true">ties</normalised>, obligations, and Oaths to the contrary; and that <lb/>
all methods whatsoever, tho never so unrighteous and wicked, not only <lb/>
may, but ought to be made use of for the support and preservation; and <lb/>
that in such cases the goodness of the Intention and end sanctifies the means. <lb/>
4. That Political Oaths lose their Power, Force, and obligation, and <lb/>
may very lawfully and fairly be parted with, if they <normalised orig="interfer" auto="false">interfere</normalised> with the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised> Good, of which the Representatives of the People are the true Judges. <lb/>
And that tho the Oath of Allegiance was made for the safety and security <lb/>
of the Kings Person, and to ascertain the Succession in the right line, yet in <lb/>
all such Oaths a Condition is necessarily understood, that they remain no <lb/>
longer obligatory than <normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised> Interest and Utility will allow. <lb/>
5. That all such Political Oaths, notwithstanding the exact care, which <lb/>
some wary Princes and their <normalised orig="Counsellours" auto="true">Counsellors</normalised> have taken in the adjusting, and <lb/>
forming, and wording of them, to bind the Conscience and to secure the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Soveraign" auto="true">Sovereign</normalised>, to whom they are given, in the Throne, are <normalised orig="superseeded" auto="false">superseded</normalised> and <lb/>
vacated by an antecedent and higher obligation; viz the common good <lb/>
of humane Society, which discharges men from what they have sworn to <lb/>
private persons, as all Princes are in comparison of the community. For want of <lb/>
the knowledge of this Fundamental Principle of Civil Policy, the Christians <lb/>
of old time so <normalised orig="fouly" auto="true">foully</normalised> miscarried; the discovery of which is owing to the <lb/>
improvements of this Age in all Natural, Political, and Divine knowledge <lb/>
above their scanty measures and attainments. <lb/>
6. That besides this <normalised orig="superiour" auto="true">superior</normalised> and antecedent obligation, which wholly enervates <lb/>
the force of all subsequent Oaths; in the Original Constitution of Government, <lb/>
and indeed in all  Transactions of Civil Society, as Mr. Hobbs has very <lb/>
well proved, there is a mutual part and agreement, and that upon <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>he</sic>
                     <corr>the</corr>
                  </choice> failure of <lb/>
one of the parties, the other is discharged and left to his first liberty, as if <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
he had never obliged himself at all; and that it is weakness of Judgment <lb/>
and Conscience to think or act otherwise; and that this holds, especially <lb/>
in contracts between Princes and their Subjects, who cannot be supposed in <lb/>
the Original Contract they made with the Persons, whom they constituted <lb/>
Rulers over them; that they ever intended, notwithstanding any subsequent <lb/>
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy imposed upon them, to put themselves into <lb/>
an incapacity of defending their Natural and Civil Rights, when invaded:<lb/>
or that they thereby obliged themselves to sit still, and let their Princes do <lb/>
what they would to them. <lb/>
7. That Princes for their ill Government may be Dethroned, and Abdicated, <lb/>
and Deposed, and brought to <normalised orig="condign" auto="false">condemn</normalised> punishment, if it be judged by the <lb/>
Representatives of the people, from whom they derive all their Power and Authority, <lb/>
to be expedient for the safety and benefit of the Commonwealth; <lb/>
and particularly, that Charles the First, having deserted the Parliament at <lb/>
Westminster, (tho he pretended he was driven away by the Rabble from his <lb/>
Palace) by retiring first to Windsor for the safety of his Person, and afterwards <lb/>
to York; and having, by erecting his Standard at Nottingham, made <lb/>
War upon his people, forfeited his Crown, and that the Parliament justly <lb/>
pursued him and his followers, and prosecuted them to Death: And that the <lb/>
glorious Successes, which attended the Army raised by the Parliament, and <lb/>
the absolute and entire Conquest which they gain’d over the King, was a full <lb/>
proof, that God was on our side, and that they fought the Lords Batels against <lb/>
the ungodly Cavaliers, and that they were doing the work of God in the <lb/>
whole course and traverse of that just and necessary War. <lb/>
8. That possession, which way <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised> <normalised orig="acquir" auto="true">acquire</normalised>’d, whether by Invasion and <lb/>
Conquest, or by Election either of the <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised> or the States of a Kingdom <lb/>
<normalised orig="conven" auto="true">convene</normalised>’d (necessity justly dispensing with all the irregularities of such a Convention) <lb/>
gives a just and full right to the Crown, without any regard to the <lb/>
Laws of Inheritance and Succession, which cannot be supposed to be unchangeable; <lb/>
and that private persons ought not to enquire nicely into Titles, but to <lb/>
rest satisfied in point of Conscience in the determination of their Representatives; <lb/>
and that such possession, whether quiet or disturbed, notwithstanding <lb/>
the Dispossessed Rightful Kings claim is a sufficient ground of Allegiance. <lb/>
And for the more effectual preventing our relapsing into these horrible <lb/>
dangers, which we have so happily escaped, our humble Petition and Advice <lb/>
is, That you declare, enact, and decree the above-mentioned Propositions,<lb/>
and no other, to be the clear and express Doctrine of the present <lb/>
Church of England, at least so far as you represent it (not doubting, but that <lb/>
the Bishops and Clergy of the other Province will readily and heartily concur <lb/>
with you herein) and that for the future, all who are to be admitted <lb/>
into any College or Hall in either of the Universities, and every time they <lb/>
take degrees in any Faculty whatever; and that all persons before they are <lb/>
Ordain’d, and <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterwards</normalised> at their Institution into any Ecclesiastical Benefice, <lb/>
or promotion to any Dignity in the Church, or to any Fellowship, Lectureship, <lb/>
Professorship, or Headship in the said Universities, shall be required <lb/>
to subscribe to the Truth of them, and by lifting up their right hand, shall <lb/>

                  <lb/>
solemnly promise to maintain them to the utmost of their power, skill, wits <lb/>
and learning. <lb/>
And that the contrary Doctrine may be wholly rooted out of the minds <lb/>
of the people, who have been so fatally blinded in these matters (till the <lb/>
Reverend Dr. Bur – among others, who have labour’d in this good work, <lb/>
has open’d their Eyes by those many excellent, pious, <choice ana="typeset-error">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr>and</corr>
                  </choice> learned Discourses, <lb/>
which he has published both in Holland, and here among us (as we in <lb/>
our Judgment believe them to be, tho some of the Gainsayers cry out upon <lb/>
them as detestable, impious, and <normalised orig="sophistical" auto="true">sophisticated</normalised>;) and for the satisfaction not only <lb/>
of us, but your own selves and Consciences, that they may never fly in <lb/>
your faces again, we make it our earnest request and Prayer, <lb/>
1. That till a new Catechism for Children, (wherein we hope will be a <lb/>
fuller and better Exposition of the Fifth Commandment, than hitherto has <lb/>
been given of it, to prevent scruples and dissatisfactions, that may possibly <lb/>
arise in some weak minds, notwithstanding their seeming present assurance <lb/>
and confidence, be set forth; and till a new system of Divinity, in relation to <lb/>
the present Constitution and Government, be drawn up by the Convocation, <lb/>
Parents and Guardians, and Schoolmasters be obliged to put into the <lb/>
hands of their Youth the Political Catechism, and to explain the necessary <lb/>
Articles and Principles of Mr. Baxter’s Holy Commonwealth; and that Tutors <lb/>
be appointed to read to their Pupils Machiavel’s Prince, Mr. Milton’s <lb/>
Defensio populi Anglicani, Junius Brutus’s Vindiciæ contra Tyrannos, as also <lb/>
Mr. Hobbs two excellent books, De <normalised orig="Cive" auto="true">Civ</normalised> and his Leviathan, if they find the <lb/>
young men to have capacity enough to understand them, and the Jesuite <lb/>
Bouchers discourse de justa Henrici tertii abdicatione, and to take care that they<lb/>
make the young men read ever once a Week, at least, the excellent Speech <lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Heroick" auto="true">Heroic</normalised> President <normalised orig="Serjeant" auto="true">Sergeant</normalised> Bradshaw, which he made when he <join original="pronounc’d"><normalised orig="pronouncd" auto="false">pronounced</normalised></join> <lb/>
the sentence of Death upon Charles the First, wherein he proves <lb/>
the gallantry, and lawfulness of what they were then acting, by the examples <lb/>
and practice of former times, both in England, and other Countries; <lb/>
and that they teach them that it is an indubitable Axiom in one new reformed <lb/>
<normalised orig="Logick" auto="true">Logic</normalised>, a facto ad jus valet argumentum. <lb/>
2. That this may be judged the Act of Universities, and be made a Statute <lb/>
never to be repealed, by the Interposition of your Authority, which must <lb/>
needs have a mighty influence upon them, so many Doctors, especially of <lb/>
the University of Oxford, and Resident there, being of your body, and you <lb/>
having honour’d the Reverend and Learned Dr. of the Chair with the Prolocutorship<lb/>
(tho we could have wish’d, that the election had lighted upon the <lb/>
Reverend Dean) we humbly pray, that a Catechistical Lecture be founded in <lb/>
each University, to instruct the Youth in the <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Divinity School, in the <lb/>
above-mention’d weighty points of Religion and Government, and that it <lb/>
may be held only for a year, and may pass <normalised orig="thro" auto="true">through</normalised>’ every College by stated <lb/>
course; and that by your recommendation, that precious Young man <lb/>
Mr. Parkinson of Lincoln College, Oxford, and Mr. Har – of Kings College, <lb/>
Cambridge, may be constituted the first Lecturers, except you shall judge<lb/>
other persons more fit to discharge this weighty Employment. <lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
3. That you would abolish the book of Homilies, as containing very insipid <lb/>
Doctrine, which the delicate palates of this Age cannot relish; and if this<lb/>
be too much to be done of a sudden, that in the next edition you leave out <lb/>
the Homilies against wilful Rebellion, at least purge out, and expunge all the <lb/>
unsound and dangerous passages in them; and especially that, wherein the <lb/>
then Church of England does arraign the noble Barons, who so bravely defended <lb/>
their Liberties against the encroachments of K John of horrible Perjury <lb/>
for inviting into England, Lewis the Dauphin of France, and swearing Fidelity <lb/>
to him, and breaking their Oath of Fidelity to their Natural Lord, the King of England, <lb/>
which they there say was done at that time, because they did not <lb/>
know their duty to their Prince set forth in Gods Word; which peremptory definition <lb/>
seems to us, notwithstanding all the artificial Distinctions of the Reverend <lb/>
and Learned Dr. St–r, to conclude equally against you and us, <lb/>
who make use of other principles, as well as against the Papists, who discharge <lb/>
themselves upon the Authority of the Pope; and therefore we redouble <lb/>
our request, that this passage, which reflects so much, be wholly <lb/>
omitted. <lb/>
4. That you blot out of the <normalised orig="Calender" auto="true">Calendar</normalised> the Martyrdom of K. Charles, that it <lb/>
may no longer be a reproach to us, and that the memory of it may be for <lb/>
ever abolish’d; that Anniversary Fast be laid aside; and that all the Sermons <lb/>
which have been Preached upon that day, and especially Dr. Burnets, and <lb/>
Mr. Pellings, be bought up at the <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> charge, and piled on a heap and <lb/>
burnt before you the next 30th of January, in the Area, before the Jerusalem <lb/>
Chamber, and that no one dare to retain any copies, much less reprint them, <lb/>
upon pain of being severely proceeded against as enemies to the present <lb/>
Establishment. <lb/>
5. That you also condemn to the flames Salmasius’s Defensio Regia, Dr. du <lb/>
Moulin’s <normalised orig="Clamor" auto="true">Clamour</normalised> Sanguinis Regis contra Parricidas Anglicanos, all the Works of <lb/>
Judge Jenkins, Archbishop Usher’s power of the Prince and obedience of the Subject <lb/>
stated, several pieces of Bishop Bramhall and Dr. Fern, Mr. Diggs of the <lb/>
Unlawfulness of taking up Arms against the King, Bishop Maxwells Sacrosancta <lb/>
regum majestas, the Pestilent book of Dr. Falkner called Christian Loyalty, <lb/>
Dr. Sherlocks discourse about Non-resistance, and Dr. Hicks’s Jovian, with several others upon <lb/>
the same argument, which we leave to your great wisdom and zeal. But however we cannot <lb/>
but mention, as most worthy your Censure, the three Decrees of the University of Oxford, <lb/>
the one made against the <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>Leareed</sic>
                     <corr>Learned</corr>
                  </choice> and Orthodox Paræus 1622. the other against the Solemn <lb/>
League and Covenant, and the third in the year 1683. wherein they condemn’d a great number <lb/>
of the best Advocates for our Cause, and after they had pass’d it in the Convocation House, Nemine <lb/>
<normalised orig="Contradicente" auto="true">Contradicent</normalised>, went into the Schools Quadrangle, and burnt those excellent Books which <lb/>
had done us so much service, by the hand of a contemptible Fellow, one Figger, Beadle of <lb/>
the Beggars; but above all, we expect that you would set a particular brand, and mark of disgrace <lb/>
upon the History of Passive Obedience, and the Bishop of Chichester’s Declaration upon his receiving  <lb/>
the Sacrament, not long before he died, and Vote them both to be Libels, they being very <lb/>
dangerous Papers, and what will do you and us a great deal of mischief, unless they be condemn’d by this Sacred Synod. <lb/>
6. That you take effectual care to make the Reverend Dr. T--- tho otherwise we have a <lb/>
great value and honour for him, as being entirely in our Interests, <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>pub*ickly</sic>

and ill-contrived Letter, which he wrote to the great, but unfortunate Lord R--- a little <lb/>
before his Execution; that Letter having done us and our Cause, as much prejudice as his <lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr/>
                  </choice> and that Dr. S--- ask forgiveness upon his <lb/>

                  <lb/>
knees in K. Henry the 7ths <normalised orig="Chappel" auto="true">Chapel</normalised>, for his indiscreet, and unseasonable Zeal, in daring to call <lb/>
in his Sermon, Preached the 30th day of January last, before the lower of House Convention, the <lb/>
Doctrine of Deposing and Murdering Kings a Popish Antichristian Doctrine, and that Dr. S----- be <lb/>
obliged under the forfeiture of his Preferment, to answer his own Sermons, and in case of refusal, <lb/>
to be made incapable of any Preferment for the future; and if, notwithstanding all this, <lb/>
the said Doctor should continue resty and obstinate, that you would appoint a Committee to <lb/>
draw up materials for an answer; of which Committee, we desire that the Pious and Judicious <lb/>
Mr. Ash----t may be Chairman and Director. <lb/>
7. That you would speedily cause to be publish’d in elegant Latin, a book De jure regni <lb/>
apud Anglos, Dialogue wise, after the way of the incomparable Buchanan; and an Apology for <lb/>
the Church of England, for the information of the Reformed Churches beyond Sea, and all <lb/>
others, who may be so curious as to <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>e*ire</sic>
                     <corr/>
                  </choice> into the reasons of your behaviour and conduct <lb/>
in your late <normalised orig="stupendious" auto="true">stupendous</normalised>, and never to be forgotten Revolution. <lb/>
8. That you would please for the common concern of Christianity, and to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> to the <lb/>
whole world, that you are Latitudinarians as well in your judgment as your practice, to widen <lb/>
the terms of your Communion, add for the sake of honest Tom Firmin, and his brethren the Socinians, <lb/>
Arrians, Anabaptists, Quakers, Muggletonians, and Sweet Singers of Israel (all of which we <lb/>
look upon as Protestants, forasmuch as this is the known denomination of the common Doctrine of <lb/>
the Western part of Christendom, in opposition to the errors and corruptions of the Church of Rome, and we <lb/>
believe all these do hate, detest, and abominate those errors and corruptions, as much as you <lb/>
and we do) leave out of the Liturgy the Nicene, and Athanasian Creeds, which hinder a great <lb/>
many godly people from <normalised orig="joyning" auto="true">joining</normalised> with you; and who knows, but that by this Comprehensive <lb/>
Charity, you may induce the Turks, as soon as the News of it shall be communicated to the <lb/>
Grand Seignior and the Mufti at <normalised orig="Constantinople" auto="true">Constantine</normalised>, to turn Christians; and that such a Form of <lb/>
sound words may be drawn up, in which all sorts of <normalised orig="Perswasions" auto="true">Persuasions</normalised> here in England, Holland, <lb/>
and Poland may agree, except Jews, Papists, and the New <normalised orig="Schismaticks" auto="true">Schismatics</normalised>, upon whom the Government, <lb/>
we doubt not, as the Reverend Author of the Letter, relating to the present Convocation, <lb/>
does very wisely suggest, will <normalised orig="lye" auto="true">lie</normalised> very heavy, so that they will be crushed and fall to nothing.<lb/>
Lastly, that out of a wise and careful regard to the blessed effects of Union and Peace, and <lb/>
out of a just respect to the Churches of Holland, Switzerland and Geneva, you will <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> your <lb/>
selves men of that temper and moderation, which some of you promised you would be when ever <lb/>
it lay in your power, which blessed time we hope now is come (for Toleration, and an utter <lb/>
extinction of the Penal Statutes, which at another time we would have been <normalised orig="extream" auto="true">extreme</normalised> glad of, <lb/>
we hope was not the only favour, tho a great one, you design’d us) and that in the further <lb/>
prosecution of that good temper, we expect that you should comply with the wise and peaceable <lb/>
proposals made in all our Names, by our dear brother in his healing attempt; and that you <lb/>
stand not so stiff upon the establish’d Constitution, but admit our Ordinations to be as good and <lb/>
valid as your own; without which Concession, we think it our duty, as it becomes honest and <lb/>
conscientious men, who are afraid to dissemble, to acquaint you in plain downright English, <lb/>
that let your alterations in the Liturgy and Canons be never so many, and your Condescentions never so <lb/>
great, in order to gain us as the Reverend President advised you, (whose wonderful Charity <lb/>
towards us, and kindness for us and our Principles, we can never sufficiently extol) we neither <lb/>
will, nor can ever unite with you, or be of your Church. And to <normalised orig="encline" auto="true">incline</normalised> you, or rather force <lb/>
you by a very powerful and convincing argument, to comply with us herein, we desire you to <lb/>
set before your Eyes the Church of Scotland, where Episcopacy being wholly abolished, and their <lb/>
Revenues seized to the Uses of the State, Presbytery is become the Church-Government of that Kingdom; <lb/>
and that as our dear Brethren, the Scotch Covenanters, freed us once by their kind assistance, <lb/>
from the Yoke and Tyranny of your Predecessors, so we doubt not, but that upon occasion, <lb/>
except you shall relent toward us, they will rescue us once more out of your hands. <lb/>
These proposals we humbly lay before your Reverences, hoping that you will take them into <lb/>
your serious consideration, and receive them with all Christian temper and moderation, and <lb/>
<normalised orig="gratifie" auto="true">gratify</normalised> us in these our just Requests, which will be your Interest as well as ours, in order to <lb/>
a perfect Settlement; ours will be the comfort, and yours the glory, and we, and all our Ages <lb/>
to come, will call you blessed Reconcilers and Peacemakers, and Repairers of the breaches <lb/>
of our English <normalised orig="Sion" auto="true">Zion</normalised>. And your Petitioners shall ever pray, &amp;c. <lb/>
FINIS.<lb/>
