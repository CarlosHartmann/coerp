blindfold at the last thorough <normalised orig="vncertaine" auto="true">uncertain</normalised> by paths <lb/>

of the messengers of light. If wee <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> to the <lb/>
Church, consisting of the <normalised orig="Iewes" auto="true">Jews</normalised> alone before the <lb/>
<normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> of Christ, we <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> it recorded by the holy <lb/>

what any man before <normalised orig="vs" auto="true">us</normalised> <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> thought fit to be done, but <lb/>

Of this mind are likewise the learned of the Church <lb/>
of Rome, You know (saith Master Harding in his <lb/>
confutation of Bishop <normalised orig="Iewels" auto="true">Jewels</normalised> <normalised orig="Apologie" auto="true">Apology</normalised>) it is no good <lb/>

make this argument: The Papists <normalised orig="liues" auto="true">lives</normalised> be <normalised orig="faultie" auto="true">faulty</normalised>, Ergo, <lb/>
their teaching is false. I know that howsoever my <lb/>

yet <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised> will offer crooked measure in <lb/>

you of the doctrine they teach you, to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> the truth <lb/>

greater, I presume, my masters of Rome <normalised orig="ca~not" auto="true">cannot</normalised> boast <lb/>
of in these later times, then Baronius the <normalised orig="Cardinall" auto="true">Cardinal</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> recorded to be done by Simon Magus, that instrument <lb/>

we may <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> of others of that <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised>. But for resolution <lb/>
of this point, I will here set <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> a discourse <lb/>
of a learned Father, the which is well worthy of <lb/>
your observation: "Since Heresies have gained <lb/>
place in the Church, there can <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> no <normalised orig="proofe" auto="true">proof</normalised> of <lb/>
true <normalised orig="Christianitie" auto="true">Christianity</normalised>, neither refuge for Christians <lb/>
willing to know the truth, but the holy Scriptures: <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="23">22</fw>
                  <pb n="22"/>
                  <lb/>
Heretofore it was by many <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> declared which <lb/>
was the Church of Christ, and which was <normalised orig="Gentilisme" auto="false">Gentilism</normalised>; <lb/>
but now there is no way for those that are <lb/>
willing to know which is the true Church of <lb/>
Christ, but by the Scriptures only: wherefore? because <lb/>
all those things that properly belong to <lb/>
Christ in truth, Heresies likewise <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> in <normalised orig="schisme" auto="true">schism</normalised>: <lb/>
they <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> churches, they <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> the holy scriptures <lb/>
they <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> Bishops &amp; other orders of the <normalised orig="Clergie" auto="true">Clergy</normalised>: <lb/>
they have <normalised orig="Baptisme" auto="true">Baptism</normalised>, the holy Eucharist, and all other <lb/>
things, yea Christ <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>: whosoever therefore <lb/>
is willing to know which is the true Church <lb/>
of Christ, how <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> he know it in the confusion of <lb/>
so great resemblance, but by the Scriptures only? <lb/>
Heretofore it was <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised> by miracles, which <lb/>
were true Christians, which false: by what means? <lb/>
The false, either could not work <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> as the true <lb/>
Christians did, or at least not such as true <normalised orig="Christia~s" auto="true">Christians</normalised> <lb/>
could: But now the working of miracles is wholly <lb/>
ceased, and it is observed, that counterfeit <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> <lb/>
are more wrought with them that are false Christians: <lb/>
Nay Peter in Clement <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> foreshewed, that <lb/>
Antichrist <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> power <normalised orig="giue~" auto="true">given</normalised> him to work true <lb/>
miracles. Heretofore by the outward <normalised orig="co~versation" auto="false">conversation</normalised> <lb/>
the Church of Christ might be <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised>, when the <lb/>
lives of Christians, either all or the most part were <lb/>
holy, such as it was not with others: but now <normalised orig="christia~s" auto="true">christians</normalised> <lb/>
are become as <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised>, or worse, then <normalised orig="heretikes" auto="true">heretics</normalised> or <lb/>
Gentiles: nay there is a better outward carriage <lb/>
many times observed amongst those that are in <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="24">D</fw>
                  <pb n="23"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="Schisme" auto="true">Schism</normalised>, then amongst Christians. <normalised orig="Hee" auto="true">He</normalised> therefore <lb/>
that would know which is the true Church of <lb/>
Christ, how should <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> know it, but only by the <lb/>
Scriptures. Our Lord therefore knowing that so <lb/>
great confusion of things would happen in the <lb/>
last <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, commands Christians, that desire to <normalised orig="receiue" auto="true">receive</normalised> <lb/>
assurance of true faith, to fly to nothing but <lb/>
the holy Scriptures. If they <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> to other things <lb/>
they shall be <normalised orig="scandalized" auto="true">scandalised</normalised> and perish, not <normalised orig="vndersta~ding" auto="true">understanding</normalised> <lb/>
which is the true Church, and thereby shall <lb/>
light <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the abomination of desolation, which <lb/>
shall stand in the holy places of the Church, &amp;c." <lb/>
Thus far St. Chrysostom. My masters of Rome (howsoever <lb/>
they <normalised orig="glose" auto="true">gloss</normalised> it) like not the language of this <lb/>
learned Father. To wish <normalised orig="the~" auto="true">them</normalised> to expose their Church <lb/>
and doctrine, to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> judged by the holy Scriptures, <lb/>
were a hard saying, &amp; with the Capernaites in good <lb/>
reason they may tell you, they cannot <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> it. But if <lb/>
St. <normalised orig="Chrysostome" auto="true">Chrisostome</normalised> had dealt so friendly with them, as <lb/>
in place of (<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> Scriptures) to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> named the <lb/>
word of God, defining that word to consist as well <lb/>
of <normalised orig="vnwritten" auto="true">unwritten</normalised> traditions, as the written word; &amp; had <lb/>
<normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised> assigned the Church of Rome, with her <normalised orig="supreame" auto="true">supreme</normalised> <lb/>
Pastor, to be the <normalised orig="trustie" auto="true">trusty</normalised> treasurer of <normalised orig="vnwritten" auto="true">unwritten</normalised> <lb/>
verities, and the only <normalised orig="infallibel" auto="false">infallible</normalised> interpreter of the <lb/>
written word, whereof the Cardinals conclusion <lb/>
might <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> made good, That which <normalised orig="pleaseth" auto="true">pleases</normalised> <lb/>
the Church is Gods <normalised orig="expresse" auto="true">express</normalised> word; and at the last resolving <lb/>
this Church into the Pope alone, <normalised orig="questionlesse" auto="true">questionless</normalised> <lb/>
they would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> taken it as <normalised orig="kindnes" auto="true">kindness</normalised> at his <lb/>

                  <lb/>
hands. But if he will insist <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> only Scriptures they <lb/>
will never <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> over <normalised orig="cavelling" auto="false">cavilling</normalised> at this point: First <lb/>
they will tell him, that many things belong to Christian <lb/>
faith, which are contained in the Scriptures neither <lb/>
openly, nor obscurely: St. <normalised orig="Chrysostome" auto="true">Chrisostome</normalised> it <normalised orig="seemes" auto="true">seems</normalised> <lb/>
was of another mind, who <normalised orig="affirmeth" auto="true">affirms</normalised>, That whatsoever <lb/>
is required to salvation is all, accomplished in the <lb/>
Scriptures, neither is any thing wanting there, that is <lb/>
<normalised orig="needfull" auto="true">needful</normalised> for mans salvation: which <normalised orig="mooues" auto="true">moves</normalised> another <lb/>
of the ancients to advise, That we refuse <normalised orig="whatsoeuer" auto="true">whatsoever</normalised> <lb/>
is taught, <normalised orig="vnlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> it <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> contained in the volume of the <lb/>
Bible: a reason whereof, Cyril, a learned Father <lb/>
<normalised orig="giues" auto="true">gives</normalised>, Because such things are written, as the Apostles <lb/>
saw sufficient for our faith and manners. Possibly, <lb/>
if they be <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised> much, in good nature they will <lb/>
acknowledge at the last, (as Bishop the <normalised orig="Seminarie" auto="true">Seminary</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> in his Tract against M. Perkins of Traditions) <lb/>
That the doctrine of salvation (at least so much as every <lb/>
simple Christian is bound to <normalised orig="beleeue" auto="true">believe</normalised> <normalised orig="vnder" auto="true">under</normalised> <normalised orig="perill" auto="true">peril</normalised> of <lb/>
damnation) is contained in the holy Scriptures, though <lb/>
not so for <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, and his learned brethren: but then <lb/>
will they <normalised orig="taxe" auto="true">tax</normalised> the Scriptures with <normalised orig="obscuritie" auto="true">obscurity</normalised>, &amp; discourage <lb/>
you from <normalised orig="medling" auto="true">meddling</normalised> with them, <normalised orig="vnder" auto="true">under</normalised> that <lb/>
<normalised orig="pretense" auto="false">pretence</normalised> affirming, that they cannot be comprehended <lb/>
by the <normalised orig="capacitie" auto="true">capacity</normalised> of the vulgar &amp; <normalised orig="vnlearned" auto="true">unlearned</normalised> reader. <lb/>
To this I oppose the <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> of S. Austin, <lb/>
who <normalised orig="plainely" auto="true">plainly</normalised> <normalised orig="tels" auto="true">tells</normalised> <normalised orig="vs" auto="true">us</normalised> That God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> bowed <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> <lb/>
the Scriptures, even to the <normalised orig="capacitie" auto="true">capacity</normalised> of babes and sucklings; <lb/>
That when proud men will not <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> to their <normalised orig="capacitie" auto="true">capacity</normalised>, <lb/>
yet <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> might. To like purpose S. Chryostome, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="26">D 2</fw>
                  <pb n="25"/>
                  <lb/>
That God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> penned the Scriptures by the <lb/>
hands of Publicans, Fishermen, Tentmakers, Shepherds, <lb/>
Neatherds, and <normalised orig="vnlearned" auto="true">unlearned</normalised> men; that none of the simple <lb/>
people might <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> an excuse, to keep them from reading; <lb/>
and that so they might <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> easily <normalised orig="vnderstood" auto="true">understood</normalised> of all <lb/>
men, the Artificer, the <normalised orig="Housholder" auto="true">Householder</normalised>, and <normalised orig="widowe" auto="true">widow</normalised> woman, <lb/>
and him that is most <normalised orig="vnlearned" auto="true">unlearned</normalised>, &amp;c. thus he. To the <lb/>
resolution of these learned Fathers, my Masters of <lb/>
Rome will reply with a question; If the doctrine of <lb/>
salvation be so <normalised orig="plainely" auto="true">plainly</normalised> proposed in the holy Scriptures; <lb/>
how it should come to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised>, that it is so diversely <lb/>
<normalised orig="vnderstood" auto="true">understood</normalised>? Arrius reads it, &amp; denies the <normalised orig="divinitie" auto="true">divinity</normalised> <lb/>
of Christ; Eutiches reads it, and denies his <lb/>
<normalised orig="humanitie" auto="true">humanity</normalised>; the Gr√¶cians read it, and <normalised orig="esteeme" auto="true">esteem</normalised> it folly; <lb/>
The <normalised orig="Jewes" auto="true">Jews</normalised> read it, and are offended at it. It is read <lb/>
at this day in the Church of Rome, as likewise in the <lb/>
Church in the communion whereof wee <normalised orig="liue" auto="true">live</normalised>, and <lb/>
different opinions are collected from it; yet of either <lb/>
side, it is true, there are men of excellent gifts, <lb/>
both for wit, &amp; learning. As if my Masters of Rome <lb/>
were ignorant, that wit and learning (if not guided <lb/>
by the holy Ghost) were so <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> from being means <lb/>
to further <normalised orig="vs" auto="true">us</normalised> to a right <normalised orig="vnderstanding" auto="true">understanding</normalised> of Gods <lb/>
word, as that the more they abound in any man apart <lb/>
from grace, the more <normalised orig="irrecouerable" auto="true">irrecoverable</normalised> many <lb/>
times they plunge him into <normalised orig="errour" auto="true">error</normalised> &amp; delusion: for <lb/>
as the light of the <normalised orig="Sunne" auto="true">Sun</normalised> though visible, yet is not <lb/>
discerned by a <normalised orig="blinde" auto="true">blind</normalised> man, even so, although it <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> <lb/>

<normalised orig="betweene" auto="true">between</normalised> the <normalised orig="enterfiering" auto="false">interfering</normalised> of these holy Fathers, it <lb/>

of all: First, this discreet Lay reader must admit <lb/>
this for a principle, That little of Gods word is <lb/>
<normalised orig="co~mitted" auto="true">committed</normalised> to writing, That the greatest part of it is come <lb/>

<normalised orig="Catholike" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Mother declaring her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> by the mouth of <lb/>
our holy father, the Pope of Rome: The next rule this <lb/>
discreet Lay reader must <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> to follow is, That <lb/>
no man must <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> any other exposition of Scripture, then <lb/>
such as might agree with the doctrine of the Church of <lb/>
Rome; a reason whereof Andradius (that great <normalised orig="defendor" auto="false">defender</normalised> <lb/>
of the faith of Trent) can <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> <normalised orig="vs" auto="true">us</normalised>, because, <lb/>
All power to interpret the Scriptures, and <normalised orig="reveale" auto="true">reveal</normalised> the <lb/>
hidden mysteries of our religion, is <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> from heaven <lb/>
to the Popes, and their <normalised orig="Councells" auto="true">Counsels</normalised>. Where, though the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Councells" auto="true">Counsels</normalised> be placed as a page to attend the Pope; <lb/>
yet the resolution of all is this (as before I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> noted) <lb/>
that if the <normalised orig="Councell" auto="true">Council</normalised> shall dissent in <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> <lb/>
from the Pope, The <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> of the Pope is to be <lb/>
preferred before the <normalised orig="iudgement" auto="true">judgment</normalised> of all others, saith the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Cardinall" auto="true">Cardinal</normalised> Turrecremata. Of whom another writer <lb/>
of the Roman Church in <normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised> <normalised orig="tearmes" auto="true">terms</normalised> <normalised orig="affirmeth" auto="true">affirms</normalised>, <lb/>
That he is the master of our faith, and cannot but <normalised orig="attaine" auto="true">attain</normalised> <lb/>
the truth of faith, nor can be <normalised orig="deceaued" auto="true">deceived</normalised> or <normalised orig="erre" auto="true">err</normalised>, if as <lb/>
<normalised orig="chiefe" auto="true">chief</normalised> Bishop, and master of the faith, he set <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> his <lb/>
determination. From all which it is evident (if you <lb/>
<normalised orig="marke" auto="true">mark</normalised> it well) that although these Vicedei of <lb/>
Rome could never <normalised orig="compasse" auto="true">compass</normalised> wholly to <normalised orig="suppresse" auto="true">suppress</normalised> <lb/>
the sacred Scriptures (as with good discretion possibly <lb/>
