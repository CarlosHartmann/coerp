does throughout all the remaining parts of it<lb/>
instruct us in the duties of a Christian, by which<lb/>
that happiness is to be <normalised orig="attain'd" auto="true">attained</normalised>, which are all<lb/>
<normalised orig="sum'd" auto="true">summed</normalised> up in the love of God, which is here most<lb/>

            <sp who="b">

if by God's help, I can but faithfully observe it, I<lb/>
shall not fail of the love of God.<lb/>

how <normalised orig="practis'd" auto="true">practised</normalised>, and how preserved.<lb/>

first <normalised orig="expell" auto="true">expel</normalised> all contrary loves out of my heart, and<lb/>
then consider the motives and causes that excite it,<lb/>
the former is taught in the Vow of Baptism, the<lb/>
latter in the Creed.<lb/>
When divine love is once <normalised orig="produc'd" auto="true">produced</normalised>, my next<lb/>
care is to put it in practice, and that is, by bringing<lb/>
forth the fruits, or effects of Love, which are<lb/>
all <normalised orig="contain'd" auto="true">contained</normalised> in the Ten Commandments.<lb/>
When the love of God is <normalised orig="produc'd" auto="true">produced</normalised> in my heart,<lb/>
and is set on work, my last concern is to preserve,<lb/>
and ensure, and quicken it; It is <normalised orig="preserv'd" auto="true">preserved</normalised> by<lb/>
Prayer, the pattern of which is the Lord's Prayer;<lb/>
It is ensured to us by the Sacraments, which are the<lb/>
Pledges of Love; and more particularly it is <normalised orig="quickned" auto="true">quickened</normalised><lb/>
by the Holy Eucharist, which is the feast of<lb/>
Love. So that the plain order of the Catechism<lb/>
teaches me the rise, the progress, and the perfection<lb/>
of Divine love, which God of his great mercy<lb/>
give me grace to follow.<lb/>

beloved Father to bruise thee, and to put thee to grief,
when the iniquities of the whole World were laid on
thee, and my numerous sins <normalised orig="increast" auto="true">increased</normalised> thy load, and
<normalised orig="heightned" auto="true">heightened</normalised> thy torment, when thy own Deity withdrew
all consolation from thee, when God, offended
by our sins, did afflict thee in the day of his fierce
anger; no sufferings, no love was ever like unto
thine for me; no grief, no love but thy own should
exceed mine for thee.
For whom, O unutterable goodness, <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> thou
suffer the extreme bitterness <choice ana="illegible">
               <sic>o*</sic>
               <corr>of</corr>
            </choice> sorrow, but for the
vilest of all thy Creatures, <normalised orig="sinfull" auto="true">sinful</normalised> man, and for me
one of the worst of Sinners? and therefore I praise
and love thee.
For what end <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> thou suffer, O most ardent

were <notvariant>destructicve</notvariant>, the Curse of the Law, the <normalised orig="Terrours" auto="true">Terrors</normalised>
of Death, the Tyranny of Sin, the Powers
of Darkness, and Torments Eternal, to purchase
for us all things <notvariant>conducible</notvariant> to our Happiness,
Pardon and Grace, Consolation and Acceptance,
and the everlasting Joys and Glories of the Kingdom
of Heaven; and therefore I praise and love
thee.
<pb n="21"/>
Out of what motive <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> thou suffer, O
boundless <notvariant>Benignity</notvariant>, but out of thy own preventing
love, free mercy, and pure compassion,
and therefore I praise and love thee.
When no other Sacrifice could <normalised orig="attone" auto="true">atone</normalised> thy Father's
Anger, O thou the beloved Son of God, and
reconcile Divine Justice and Mercy together, but
the Sacrifice of God incarnate, who as man was to
die, and to suffer in our stead, as God was to
merit and make satisfaction for our sins; <normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> then
that thou, O God the Son, <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> become Man, the
very meanest of Men, <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> take upon thee the form of
a Servant, and <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> on the Cross <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> us the mystery
and the Miracle of Love, God crucified for Sinners,
and Sinners <normalised orig="redeem'd" auto="true">redeemed</normalised> by the <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of God.
O thou propitious Wonder, God incarnate on
the Cross, by what Names shall I adore thee, all
are too short, too scanty, to express thee, Love
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, nothing but Love will reach thee, thou art
Love, O <notvariant>Jesu</notvariant>, thou art all love, O tenderest, O
sweetest, O purest, O dearest Love, soften, sweeten,
refine, love me into all Love like thee!
By the love of thy Cross, O <notvariant>Jesu</notvariant>, I live, in
that I will <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> glory, that above all things will I
study, that before all things will I value; by
the love of thy Cross I will take up my Cross daily,
and follow thee, I will persecute and torment, and
crucify my <normalised orig="sinfull" auto="true">sinful</normalised> Affections and Lusts, which persecuted,
tormented and <normalised orig="crucify'd" auto="true">crucified</normalised> thee; and if thy
love calls me to it, I will suffer on the Cross for
thee, as thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> done for me.
How illustrious and amiable were thy Graces amidst
all thy Sufferings, O thou afflicted <notvariant>Jesu</notvariant>; I admire,
and I love thy profound Humility, <notvariant>unwearied</notvariant>
Patience, Lamb-like Meekness, immaculate Innocence,
invincible Courage, absolute Resignation,
compassionate love of Souls, and perfect Charity
to thy Enemies. O my Love, I cannot love thee,
but I must desire above all things to be like my
Beloved; O give me grace to tread in thy steps,
and conform me to thy Divine Image, that the
more I grow like thee, the more I may love thee,
and the more I may be <normalised orig="lov'd" auto="true">loved</normalised> by thee.

I believe, O crucified Lord, that thou <normalised orig="wast" auto="true">were</normalised> really

I believe, O pierced, O wounded Love, that thy
Soul in the state of separation did descend into
