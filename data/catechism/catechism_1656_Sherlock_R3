where <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised> as the first of<lb/>
the principles of the Doctrines of Christ,<lb/>

thereunto, before I can truly serve<lb/>
God, or receive any benefit by the<lb/>

Two things: 1. Repentance, whereby<lb/>
they forsake sin, and consequently<lb/>
the service of the world, the flesh,<lb/>
and the Devil, tempting unto sin.<lb/>
2. Faith, <choice ana="illegible">

They have Faith and Repentance in<lb/>

these duties, thou not by<lb/>
themselves, yet by their sureties, who<lb/>

For two reasons chiefly: 1. For a<lb/>

                  <lb/>
God through Christ: now the life of<lb/>
faith is obedience or good-works; for<lb/>

of Christs death. 4. That<lb/>
they be in charity with all men:<lb/>
which charity is exercised in giving,<lb/>
and forgiving: 1. Giving unto others,<lb/>

<p>O Holy Jesus, who <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> vouchsafed,

ordain Sacraments whereby I may

the hopes of a full and immediate
