<normalised orig="al" auto="true">all</normalised> those notional Systems of<lb/>

extent of these Questions, and<lb/>
<normalised orig="therfore" auto="true">therefore</normalised> I desire not to descend<lb/>
into Particulars; but<lb/>
<normalised orig="chuse" auto="true">choose</normalised> rather to <normalised orig="leav" auto="false">leave</normalised> them in<lb/>

now, before I enter upon that<lb/>
Answer, I think fitting to premise<lb/>
one Word in further Confirmation<lb/>
of thy Supposition,<lb/>
That our Eternal Happiness dos<lb/>

really depend upon the Performance<lb/>

make by our natural Light,<lb/>
yet it <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> be useful unto us to<lb/>
<normalised orig="observ" auto="true">observe</normalised> also what Ground it has<lb/>
in Scripture. For we must remember<lb/>
that the View we <normalised orig="ar" auto="true">are</normalised><lb/>
now taking of Religion is properly<lb/>
to be confined unto that<lb/>
<normalised orig="Knowledg" auto="true">Knowledge</normalised> we have of it by<lb/>
Divine Revelation. And in<lb/>
this Method I think I <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised><lb/>
establish the same Conclusion<lb/>
by as clear Testimony as it is<lb/>
possible for Words to express.<lb/>
If we <normalised orig="examin" auto="true">examine</normalised> it (First) by those<lb/>
figurative Expressions, of<lb/>
knowing Christ, of loving<lb/>
Christ, of believing in<lb/>
Christ, of being in Christ,<lb/>
of being born of God,<lb/>
and the like, which <normalised orig="al" auto="true">all</normalised> import<lb/>

a Title to future Happiness,<lb/>
we <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> no other Mark<lb/>
<normalised orig="wherby" auto="true">whereby</normalised> to know that we <normalised orig="ar" auto="true">are</normalised><lb/>
in such a Condition, <normalised orig="than" auto="true">then</normalised> by<lb/>
our Obedience to God's <normalised orig="Commandements" auto="true">Commandments</normalised>.<lb/>
Again: If we<lb/>
look into the great End of Jesus-Christ's<lb/>
coming into the<lb/>
World, we <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> indeed<lb/>
that it was to save us. But<lb/>
how? By sanctifying us.<lb/>
It is said, That <quote type="biblical" ana="Heb 5.9">he became the<lb/>
Author of Eternal Salvation.</quote>
                     <lb/>
But to whom? To them<lb/>
that obey him. <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Pet 2.24">He offered himself<lb/>
a Sacrifice, and bare our<lb/>
Sins in his own Body on the<lb/>
Tree.</quote> But why? That we might<lb/>
be <normalised orig="sanctifyed" auto="true">sanctified</normalised> by his Offering,<lb/>
and that <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Pet 2.24">being dead<lb/>
unto Sin we should <normalised orig="liv" auto="false">live</normalised> unto<lb/>
Righteousness.</quote> He redeemed us,<lb/>
also, it is <normalised orig="tru" auto="true">true</normalised>. But from what?<lb/>
From Iniquity: And <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised><lb/>
<notvariant>consequentially</notvariant> thereunto, from<lb/>
                     <pb n="6"/>
                     <lb/>
Punishment. This we must<lb/>
needs take to be the Sense of<lb/>
those Expressions, and that<lb/>
the great Design of his Appearance<lb/>
was to destroy the<lb/>
Works of the Devil. For it is<lb/>
<normalised orig="expresly" auto="true">expressly</normalised> said that nothing<lb/>
Unclean <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> in any Wise enter<lb/>
into the new Jerusalem, and<lb/>
that no Man without Holiness<lb/>
<normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> see God. And hence<lb/>
it is that Jesus-Christ himself<lb/>
so plainly <normalised orig="tels" auto="true">tells</normalised> us that it is<lb/>
                     <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 7.21">not every one that saith unto<lb/>

                     <lb/>

so carefully precaution us<lb/>
                     <pb n="7"/>
                     <lb/>
against the Mistake of Thinking<lb/>
that the hearing of the<lb/>
Law could profit us any thing<lb/>
without the doing of it. <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Jn 3.7-8">Let<lb/>
no Man <normalised orig="deceiv" auto="false">deceive</normalised> you</quote> (says<lb/>
one of them) <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Jn 3.7-8">he that <normalised orig="doth" auto="false">does</normalised><lb/>

upon those Conditions by which<lb/>
the Scripture declares we <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised><lb/>
be judged at the last Day. What<lb/>

be then demanded in us, so as<lb/>

Fear, which <normalised orig="ar" auto="true">are</normalised> the chief Movers<lb/>
unto Action: And <normalised orig="therfore" auto="true">therefore</normalised><lb/>

it not needful to branch out<lb/>
these general Heads into so many<lb/>
Subdivisions as <normalised orig="som" auto="true">some</normalised> have<lb/>

This Mistake of thine (for<lb/>
such I presume it to be) I had<lb/>
designed to obviate, by telling<lb/>
thee already that the Obedience<lb/>
required from us is such<lb/>
as is suitable to the Capacity<lb/>

desire thee to <normalised orig="observ" auto="true">observe</normalised> that if<lb/>

of Perfection in that Obedience<lb/>
as is absolutely <normalised orig="abov" auto="false">above</normalised> that<lb/>
Capacity, thou art in a manifest<lb/>
Error: For that can not<lb/>
be the Degree that is required<lb/>
from us. Let us see then what<lb/>
it is. The Expressions truly<lb/>
<normalised orig="ar" auto="true">are</normalised> very comprehensive and<lb/>
strong: viz. That we must be<lb/>
Holy, Pure, and Perfect, as our<lb/>
Father who is in Heaven is Perfect.<lb/>
<normalised orig="Wel" auto="true">Well</normalised>, what can this signify?<lb/>
The absolute Perfection<lb/>

<normalised orig="al" auto="true">all</normalised> Perfection, so We should<lb/>

that Perfection which our Natures<lb/>

Remember then that it is not<lb/>
the Perfection of God, nor of<lb/>

neither is it the same Degree of<lb/>
Perfection in each individual<lb/>
Man, but different according to<lb/>
Men's different <normalised orig="capacitys" auto="false">capacities</normalised>. In a<lb/>

what this Sincerity means; and<lb/>
that it is the very thing required<lb/>

<normalised orig="therof" auto="true">thereof</normalised> shine forth in thy life.<lb/>

                     <lb/>
exertion of <normalised orig="al" auto="true">all</normalised> possible <normalised orig="endeavors" auto="true">endeavours</normalised>,<lb/>
to do the thing required.<lb/>
<normalised orig="Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> the doing of <normalised orig="al" auto="true">all</normalised> that possibly<lb/>
can be don, and not more. That<lb/>
this is required appears from<lb/>
God's demanding the whole<lb/>
Heart, and declaring the<lb/>
<normalised orig="inconsistancy" auto="false">inconsistency</normalised> of his service<lb/>
with that of the World: I say<lb/>
this shows that he requires the<lb/>
utmost exercise of <normalised orig="al" auto="true">all</normalised> our Powers<lb/>
in the obeying of his <normalised orig="Commandements" auto="true">Commandments</normalised>.<lb/>
And where the<lb/>
Heart is thus sincere and upright,<lb/>
the Intention honest,<lb/>
and the <normalised orig="Minde" auto="true">Mind</normalised> willing, I do<lb/>
not say that the <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> is taken<lb/>
for the deed, but I affirm that<lb/>
the Deed is accepted according<lb/>
to the Measure of the Capacity,<lb/>
                     <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Cor 8.12">according to that a Man <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised>,<lb/>
and not according to that he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised><lb/>
not.</quote> And hence it is that in<lb/>
Scripture a willing Heart is<lb/>
frequently stiled a perfect Heart.<lb/>
                     <pb n="32"/>
                     <lb/>
And the Apostle Paul in<lb/>
the same place where he acknowledges<lb/>
that he had not<lb/>
really attained to Perfection, but<lb/>
was <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> pressing forwards towards<lb/>
it, nevertheless accounts<lb/>
himself amongst the number of<lb/>
those that <normalised orig="ar" auto="true">are</normalised> perfect: undoubtedly,<lb/>
because his <normalised orig="endeavors" auto="true">endeavours</normalised><lb/>
were sincere and constant.<lb/>
Now that this sort of Perfection<lb/>
is attainable is evident in<lb/>
it self, beyond any Proof that<lb/>
can be made of it. For it is nothing<lb/>
else but doing <normalised orig="al" auto="true">all</normalised> that ever a<lb/>
Man can do. And surely no Man<lb/>
is so absurd as to deny the possibility<lb/>
of his doing what he can do.<lb/>
But here it <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> be good to subjoin,<lb/>
that this notion of doing<lb/>
<normalised orig="al" auto="true">all</normalised> a Man can do is not a palliation<lb/>
for gross and frequent<lb/>
miscarriages. On the contrary,<lb/>
it is an absolute obligation<lb/>
to <normalised orig="overcom" auto="false">overcome</normalised> them. For there<lb/>

watchfulness may be so far<lb/>

not to <normalised orig="fal" auto="true">fall</normalised> frequently into the<lb/>

What so common as<lb/>
Swearing? Now can it be<lb/>

Swearer may, with a strong<lb/>

it can not. But if a quarter<lb/>
of an Hour, why not then<lb/>

a Year? The same Care <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="stil" auto="true">still</normalised> produce the same Effect.<lb/>
And not only so, but the Work<lb/>
<normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> be more easy in the End<lb/>
<normalised orig="than" auto="true">then</normalised> in the Beginning. For the<lb/>

<normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> in the End help as effectually<lb/>
