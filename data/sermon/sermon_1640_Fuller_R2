RVTH. 1.15.<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Ruth 1.15">And Naomi said, behold thy sister in Law is gone<lb/>
<normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> unto her people, and unto her gods, <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised><lb/>
thou after thy sister in Law.</quote>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
IN these words Naomi<lb/>
<normalised orig="seekes" auto="true">seeks</normalised> to <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised><lb/>
Ruth to <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised>, <normalised orig="alleaging" auto="true">alleging</normalised><lb/>
the example<lb/>
of Orpah, who as she<lb/>
saith was <quote type="biblical" ana="Ruth 1.15">gone back to<lb/>
her people, and to her<lb/>
gods</quote>; where first wee<lb/>
find that all the Heathen,<lb/>
and the Moabites amongst the rest did<lb/>
not acknowledge one true God, but were the<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="104">P</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
Worshippers of many gods; for they made<lb/>
every attribute of God to be a distinct Deity.<lb/>
Thus in stead of that attribute, the <normalised orig="wisedome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised><lb/>
of God, they fained Apollo the God of <normalised orig="wisedome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised>;<lb/>
in stead of the power of God, they<lb/>
made Mars the God of power; in stead of that<lb/>
admirable beauty of God, they had Venus the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Goddesse" auto="true">Goddess</normalised> of beauty: But no one attribute<lb/>
was so much abused, as Gods Providence. For<lb/>
the Heathen supposing, that the whole world,<lb/>
and all the creatures therein was too great a<lb/>
<normalised orig="Diocesse" auto="true">Diocese</normalised> to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> daily visited by one, and the<lb/>
same Deity; they therefore assigned sundry<lb/>
gods to <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> creatures. Thus Gods Providence<lb/>
in ruling the raging of the seas, was<lb/>
counted Neptune; in stilling the roaring wind<lb/>
Æolus in commanding the powers of Hell<lb/>
Pluto; yea sheep had their Pan, and Gardens<lb/>
their Pomona; the Heathens then being as <normalised orig="fruitfull" auto="true">fruitful</normalised><lb/>
in <normalised orig="faigning" auto="true">feigning</normalised> of gods, as the Papists since in<lb/>
making of Saints.<lb/>
Now because Naomi used the example of<lb/>
Orpah, as a motive to <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> upon Ruth to <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised>;<lb/>
wee gather from thence, Examples of<lb/>
others set before our eyes, are very potent and<lb/>
prevalent Arguments, to make us follow and<lb/>
imitate them, whether they <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> good examples,<lb/>
so the <normalised orig="forwardnesse" auto="true">forwardness</normalised> of the Corinthians<lb/>
to <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> the <normalised orig="Iewes" auto="true">Jews</normalised>, provoked many: or whether<lb/>
they be <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised>, so the dissembling of Peter<lb/>
at Antioch, Drew Barnabas and others into the same<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="105">104</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
fault: But those examples of all others are<lb/>
most forcible with us, which are set by such<lb/>
who are <normalised orig="neer" auto="true">near</normalised> to us by kindred, or gracious<lb/>
with us in friendship, or great over us in<lb/>
power.<lb/>
Let men in eminent places, as Magistrates,<lb/>
Ministers, Fathers, Masters, (so that others<lb/>
love to dance after their Pipe, to sing after<lb/>
their <normalised orig="Musick" auto="true">Music</normalised>, to tread after their tract) endeavour<lb/>
to propound themselves examples of piety,<lb/>
and religion to those that be under them.<lb/>
When wee see any good example propounded<lb/>
unto us, let us strive with all possible<lb/>
speed to imitate it: what a <normalised orig="deale" auto="true">deal</normalised> of <normalised orig="stirre" auto="true">stir</normalised> is<lb/>
there in the world for <normalised orig="civill" auto="true">civil</normalised> <normalised orig="precedency" auto="true">precedence</normalised> and<lb/>
priority, every one desires to march in the<lb/>
Fore-front, and <normalised orig="thinkes" auto="true">thinks</normalised> it a shame to come laging<lb/>
in the Rear-ward. Oh that there were such<lb/>
an holy ambition, and heavenly emulation in<lb/>
our hearts, that as Peter and <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> ran a race, who<lb/>
should come first to the grave of our Saviour,<lb/>
so men would contend, who should first attain<lb/>
to true mortification; and when we see a good<lb/>
example set before us, <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>letus</sic>
                     <corr>let us</corr>
                  </choice> imitate it, though it<lb/>
be in one, which in outward respects is far our<lb/>
inferior: <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> not our Masters be ashamed, to see<lb/>
that their men, whose place on earth is to come<lb/>
behind them, in piety towards Heaven to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised><lb/>
before them? shall not the Husband blush<lb/>
to see his Wife, which is the weaker <normalised orig="vessell" auto="true">vessel</normalised><lb/>
in nature, the stronger <normalised orig="vessell" auto="true">vessel</normalised> in grace?<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="106">P2</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
shall not the elder Brother <normalised orig="dye" auto="true">die</normalised> his cheeks with<lb/>
the colour of <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised>, to see his younger Brother,<lb/>
who was last borne, first reborne by<lb/>
faith, and the Holy Ghost? yet let him not<lb/>
therefore <normalised orig="envie" auto="true">envy</normalised> his Brother, as Cain did Abel,<lb/>
let him not be angry with his Brother, because<lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> is better than <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, but let him be angry<lb/>
with <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, because <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> is worse than<lb/>
his brother, let him <normalised orig="turne" auto="true">turn</normalised> all his malice into<lb/>
imitation, all his fretting at him into following<lb/>
of him. Say unto him, as Gehazi did of<lb/>
Naaman; <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Kings 5.20">As the Lord <normalised orig="liveth" auto="true">lives</normalised> I will run after him:</quote>
                  <lb/>
and although thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> not over-run him, nor<lb/>
as yet <normalised orig="over-looke" auto="false">over-look</normalised> him; yet give not over to<lb/>
run with him, follow him, though not as Azael<lb/>
did Abner, hard at the <normalised orig="heeles" auto="true">heals</normalised>; yet as Peter<lb/>
did our Saviour, a <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> off; that though the<lb/>
more slowly, yet as surely thou <normalised orig="mayest" auto="true">may</normalised> come<lb/>
to Heaven; and though thou <normalised orig="wert" auto="true">were</normalised> short of<lb/>
him while <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> lived, in the race, yet thou shalt<lb/>
be even with him when thou art dead, at the<lb/>
<normalised orig="marke" auto="true">mark</normalised>.<lb/>
When any <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> example is presented unto<lb/>
us, let us decline and detest it, though the men<lb/>
be never so many, or so <normalised orig="deare" auto="true">dear</normalised> unto us. Imitate<lb/>
Micaiah, 1 King.22. to whom when the Messenger<lb/>
sent to fetch him, said, <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Kings 22.13-14">Behold now the<lb/>
words of the Prophets, declare good unto the King<lb/>
with one mouth, let thy Word therefore I pray thee<lb/>
be like to one of them; Micaiah answered, As the<lb/>
Lord <normalised orig="liveth" auto="true">lives</normalised>, whatsoever he Lord saith unto me, that<lb/>
                     <pb n="5"/>
                     <lb/>
will I <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>.</quote> If they be never so <normalised orig="deare" auto="true">dear</normalised> unto us,<lb/>
wee must not follow their <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> practise: so<lb/>
must the <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised> please him that begot him, that<lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not displease him that created him;<lb/>
so must the wife follow him that married her,<lb/>
that she <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not offend him that made her;<lb/>
wherefore as Samson, though bound with new<lb/>
cords <normalised orig="snapt" auto="true">snapped</normalised> them asunder, as tow when it <normalised orig="feeleth" auto="true">feels</normalised><lb/>
the fire; so rather then we should be led by<lb/>
the lewd examples of those, that be <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> and<lb/>
<normalised orig="deare" auto="true">dear</normalised> unto us, let us <normalised orig="breake" auto="true">break</normalised> in <normalised orig="peeces" auto="true">pieces</normalised> all their<lb/>
engagements, relations whatsoever.<lb/>
Now here it will be a labour, worthy discourse,<lb/>
to consider how <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> the examples,<lb/>
even of good men in the Bible are to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> followed.<lb/>
For as all examples have a great influence<lb/>
on the practise of the Beholders, so especially<lb/>
the deeds of good men <normalised orig="registred" auto="true">registered</normalised> in the<lb/>
Scripture (the <normalised orig="Kalender" auto="true">Calendar</normalised> of Eternity) are most<lb/>
attractive of imitation.<lb/>
Wee find in Holy Writ nine <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> kinds<lb/>
of examples. First Actions extraordinary, the<lb/>
doers whereof had peculiar strength, and dispensation<lb/>
from God to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> them. Thus Phineas<lb/>
in an heavenly fury killed Cozbi and<lb/>
Zimri, Samson slew <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, and the Philistims<lb/>
in the Temple of Dagon; Elias caused fire to<lb/>
descend on the two <normalised orig="Captaines" auto="true">Captains</normalised> of fifties; Elisha<lb/>
cursed the children, the children of Bethel.<lb/>
These are written for our instruction, not for<lb/>
our imitation, if with Elisha thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> make a<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="108">P3</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
Bridge over <normalised orig="Iordan" auto="true">Jordan</normalised> with thy <normalised orig="cloake" auto="true">cloak</normalised>, if<lb/>
with him thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> raise dead children,<lb/>
then it is <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised> for thee, with Elisha to curse<lb/>
thy enemies. If thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> not imitate him in<lb/>
the one, pretend not to follow him in the other.<lb/>
When men propound such examples for<lb/>
their practise, what is said is imputed to<lb/>
Phineas for <normalised orig="righteousnesse" auto="true">righteousness</normalised>, will <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> imputed<lb/>
to us for Iniquity, if being private men<lb/>
by a Commission of our <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> penning, wee<lb/>
<normalised orig="usurpe" auto="true">usurp</normalised> the Sword of <normalised orig="Iustice" auto="true">Justice</normalised> to punish Malefactors.<lb/>
Actions founded in the <normalised orig="ceremoniall" auto="true">ceremonial</normalised> Law, as <normalised orig="Abrahams" auto="true">Abraham's</normalised><lb/>
circumcising of Isaac, Hezekiahs eating<lb/>
the <normalised orig="Passeover" auto="true">Passover</normalised>, Solomons offering of sacrifices,<lb/>
&amp;c.<lb/>
We are to be thankful to God, that these <choice ana="illegible">

Let us not therefore superstitiously <normalised orig="faine" auto="true">fain</normalised>, that<lb/>
the ghosts of these Ceremonies may <normalised orig="stil" auto="true">still</normalised> walk,<lb/>
which long since were buried in Christs grave.<lb/>
By those who still <normalised orig="retaine" auto="true">retain</normalised> them. Excellently<lb/>
Ignatius, Epist. ad Magnesios, NoValue. Yea, wee must forfeit the<lb/>
name of Christians, if we still <normalised orig="retaine" auto="true">retain</normalised> such old<lb/>
Rites. Let those who are admitted in the<lb/>

to the <normalised orig="schoole" auto="true">school</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Ceremoniall" auto="true">Ceremonial</normalised> Law, which<lb/>
truly may <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> called the <normalised orig="Schoole" auto="true">School</normalised> of Tyrannus.<lb/>
Actions which are founded in the <normalised orig="Iudiciall" auto="true">Judicial</normalised><lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
Law, as punishing theft with <normalised orig="foure-fold" auto="true">four-fold</normalised><lb/>
Restitution, putting of Adulterers to death,<lb/>
and raising up seed to the Brother, &amp;c.<lb/>
These oblige men, to observe them so<lb/>
<normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised>, as they have in them any taste or tincture<lb/>

proportion with those Statutes, by which<lb/>
every particular <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised> is governed.<lb/>
For the <normalised orig="Iudiciall" auto="true">Judicial</normalised> Law was by God calculated<lb/>
alone, for the elevation of the<lb/>

in a <normalised orig="darke" auto="true">dark</normalised> age, wherein his pleasure was not so<lb/>

If any in this bright sun-shine of the Gospel,<lb/>

their example.<lb/>
<normalised orig="Doubtfull" auto="true">Doubtful</normalised> examples, which may so be termed,<lb/>
because it is difficult to decide, whether the<lb/>

they would <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> <normalised orig="puzzelled" auto="true">puzzled</normalised>, whether to <normalised orig="condemne" auto="true">condemn</normalised><lb/>
or acquit them, and at last be forced to<lb/>
find it an Ignoramus. As whether David did<lb/>
well to dissemble <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> <normalised orig="frantick" auto="true">frantic</normalised>, thereby<lb/>
to escape the cruelty of Ashish, King of Gath.<lb/>
Whether Hufhai did well, in counterfeiting<lb/>

with <normalised orig="Absolom" auto="true">Absalom</normalised>, or whether therein <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised><lb/>

to earth, I <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> <normalised orig="Policie" auto="true">Policy</normalised> to entrench<lb/>

good a States-man, that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was a <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised><lb/>
man.<lb/>
Let us not meddle with imitation of these<lb/>
actions, that are so full of difficulty and danger,<lb/>
that our judgements therein may easily<lb/>
<normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> deceived: The <normalised orig="sonnes" auto="true">sons</normalised> of Barzillai, EZr.2.63<lb/>
Because their Genealogies were <normalised orig="doubtfull" auto="true">doubtful</normalised> and <normalised orig="uncertaine" auto="true">uncertain</normalised>,<lb/>
were put by the Priest-hood, till a Priest<lb/>
should rise up with Vrim and Thummim, by<lb/>
which wee may understand some <normalised orig="especiall" auto="true">especial</normalised><lb/>
man amongst them, who by Gods Spirit might<lb/>
be able to decide the controversies, which<lb/>
were questioned in their pedigrees. So let us<lb/>
<normalised orig="refraine" auto="true">refrain</normalised> from following these <normalised orig="doubtfull" auto="true">doubtful</normalised><lb/>
examples, till (which in this world is<lb/>
not likely to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised>) there arise an infallible<lb/>
<normalised orig="Iudge" auto="true">Judge</normalised>, which can determine in these<lb/>

done or no.<lb/>
By such who though they have <normalised orig="roome" auto="true">room</normalised><lb/>

wherein there is great danger of miscarrying.<lb/>
<normalised orig="Mixt" auto="true">Mixed</normalised> examples which <normalised orig="containe" auto="true">contain</normalised> in them a<lb/>

the unjust Steward, there was his <normalised orig="wisedome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised><lb/>
to provide for <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, which God <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised><lb/>
commend; and his <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised>, to purloyne<lb/>
from his Master, which God cannot but <normalised orig="condemne" auto="true">condemn</normalised>.<lb/>
Thus in the Hebrew Midwives, Exod. 1.<lb/>
when they told the <normalised orig="lye" auto="true">lie</normalised>, there was in them,<lb/>
                  Fides mentis, &amp; fallacia mentientis, the <normalised orig="faithfulnesse" auto="true">faithfulness</normalised><lb/>
of their love to their <normalised orig="Countreymen" auto="true">Countrymen</normalised>,<lb/>
and the <normalised orig="falsenesse" auto="true">falseness</normalised> of their lying to Pharaoh.<lb/>
Behold, here is <normalised orig="wisedome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised>, and let the man<lb/>
that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> understanding, discreetly divide betwixt<lb/>
the Gold and the <normalised orig="Drosse" auto="true">Dross</normalised>, the Wheat<lb/>

the students of Christ-Church in Oxford,<lb/>
buried the bones of Peter Martyrs wife<lb/>
in the same Coffin, with the ashes of Fridswick<lb/>
a Popish Saint, to this intent, that if<lb/>
Popery, (which God forbid) should ever<lb/>

from one of their <normalised orig="canonized" auto="true">canonised</normalised> Saints.<lb/>
Thus in some actions of Gods Saints in the<lb/>
Bible, which are of a <normalised orig="mixt" auto="true">mixed</normalised> nature; <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> so insensibly unite and incorporate<lb/>

Moreover, labour more especially to<lb/>

And I am <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised>, there is a three-fold<lb/>
kind of <normalised orig="Perswasion" auto="true">Persuasion</normalised>, whereby one may be <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised><lb/>
of good in another man.<lb/>
1. The <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised> of Infallibility, and this<lb/>
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised>, Act. 5. 18.  <quote type="biblical" ana="Acts 15.18"><normalised orig="Knowne" auto="true">Known</normalised> unto God<lb/>
are all his <normalised orig="workes" auto="true">works</normalised> from the beginning of the World,</quote>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> alone <normalised orig="searcheth" auto="true">searches</normalised> and <normalised orig="tryeth" auto="true">tries</normalised> the hearts and <normalised orig="reines" auto="true">reins</normalised>.<lb/>
And they also have it to whom God immediately<lb/>
<normalised orig="reveales" auto="true">reveals</normalised> it. Thus Ananias knew that Paul<lb/>
was a true servant of God, after it was revealed<lb/>
to him, Act. 9.15. <quote type="biblical" ana="Acts 9.15">For <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> is a chosen <normalised orig="Vessell" auto="true">Vessel</normalised><lb/>
unto me, to <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised> my name, before the Gentiles, and<lb/>
Kings, and the children of Israel.</quote> And in this<lb/>
sense of infallible <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised>, we may understand,<lb/>
Saint Paul in the Text, because it is<lb/>
said 1 Tim. 1. 18. <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Tim 1.18">This <normalised orig="Commandement" auto="true">Commandment</normalised> write I<lb/>
unto thee, <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised> Timotheus, according to the prophecies<lb/>
which went before upon thee, that thou by<lb/>
them <normalised orig="shouldst" auto="true">should</normalised> fight a good fight.</quote>
                  <lb/>
2. The <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised> of Charity, and this I<lb/>
must <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> is but <normalised orig="weake" auto="true">weak</normalised>, and rather a presumption,<lb/>
than a <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised>. <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 13.4">Charity,</quote> 1 Corinth.<lb/>
                  <pb n="21"/>
                  <lb/>
13.17. <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 13.5"><normalised orig="Thinketh" auto="true">Thinks</normalised> no <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised></quote>, it <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 13.7"><normalised orig="beleeveth" auto="true">believed</normalised> all<lb/>
things, <normalised orig="hopeth" auto="false">hoped</normalised> all things</quote>; And in this kind of<lb/>
<normalised orig="Perswasion" auto="true">Persuasion</normalised> wee conceive that all men have<lb/>
faith dwelling in them, of whom wee<lb/>
know no just reason to conceive the contrary.<lb/>
3. The <normalised orig="Perswasion" auto="true">Persuasion</normalised> of a well, and strong<lb/>
grounded opinion, to make which, these three<lb/>
things must <normalised orig="concurre" auto="true">concur</normalised>; first the party that conceives<lb/>
this opinion, must have a good judgement,<lb/>
and discerning Spirit, well to dive and<lb/>
pierce into the natures and dispositions of men.<lb/>
Secondly, He must be long acquainted with<lb/>
that person, of whom <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> such an opinion,<lb/>
that faith <normalised orig="dwelleth" auto="true">dwells</normalised> in him. Too bold<lb/>
are these men, who upon a <normalised orig="superficiall" auto="true">superficial</normalised> knowledge,<lb/>
and short conversing with any, dare<lb/>
peremptorily pronounce, that such an one<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> saving grace and sanctity in him. These<lb/>
are Professors of <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> Palmestry, who<lb/>
<normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> that upon small experience they can see<lb/>
the Life-line (the Line of <normalised orig="Eternall" auto="true">Eternal</normalised> life in the<lb/>
hands of <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> souls) where as for all their <normalised orig="skil" auto="true">skill</normalised><lb/>
they often mistake the hands of Esau, for the<lb/>
hands of <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised>: Lastly, they must have intimate<lb/>
familiarity with them, and be not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised><lb/>
their acquaintance large, but in Ordinary.<lb/>
                  Te intus &amp; in cute novi. Put all these three together,<lb/>
that one <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a discerning Spirit, long<lb/>
and intimate acquaintance with one, and <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised><lb/>
may arrive at Saint <normalised orig="Pauls" auto="true">Paul's</normalised> <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised> in my<lb/>

long, and intimately acquainted. And in<lb/>
this sense (though it may <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> of the infallible<lb/>
<normalised orig="Perswasion" auto="true">Persuasion</normalised> by Revelation) understand<lb/>
wee that, 2 King. 4. 1. <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Kings 4.1">Now there <lb/>
<normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> a <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> Woman, of the Wives of the<lb/>

Thy Servant, my Husband is dead; and<lb/>
thou <normalised orig="knowest" auto="true">know</normalised> that thy Servant did <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised> the<lb/>

                  <lb/>
Yet for all this we may set this <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> for<lb/>
a true Position; that the wisest of men<lb/>
easily may, and sometimes are deceived<lb/>
in counting them good, which are very<lb/>
counterfeits, and especially in these cases.<lb/>
First, in close natured men, such as <normalised orig="lye" auto="true">lie</normalised> in<lb/>
at a close Guard, and offer no play, whose<lb/>
Well is <normalised orig="deepe" auto="true">deep</normalised>, and men generally want<lb/>
Buckets to measure them; so that one may<lb/>
live twenty <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> with them, and <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> never<lb/>
a whit the wiser, in knowing their disposition.<lb/>
2. In various, and inconstant men, which<lb/>
like Proteus, never <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> <normalised orig="twise" auto="true">twice</normalised> in the same<lb/>
shape, but differ as much from themselves,<lb/>

<normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> in uncertainty; so that one can<lb/>

not what to make of them.<lb/>
3. In men of an excellent nature, such as Titus<lb/>
Vespatian, was called Deliciæ humani generis.
                  <lb/>
This Euphuia presents it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> in all<lb/>
outward <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> and <normalised orig="Symptomes" auto="true">Symptoms</normalised>; So like to<lb/>
Grace that it is often mistaken for it. Whereas<lb/>
on the other side, men of a rugged,<lb/>
<normalised orig="unbrusht" auto="false">unbrushed</normalised> nature, such as were never <normalised orig="lickt" auto="true">licked</normalised>,<lb/>
<normalised orig="hewen" auto="true">hewn</normalised>, or <normalised orig="polisht" auto="true">polished</normalised>, may <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> <normalised orig="slaundered" auto="true">slandered</normalised> in<lb/>
many <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> judgements, to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> altogether<lb/>
<normalised orig="devoyd" auto="true">devoid</normalised> of Piety.<lb/>
4. In affected Dissemblers, <normalised orig="Hypocrisie" auto="true">Hypocrisy</normalised> is<lb/>
as like Piety, as <normalised orig="Hemlocke" auto="true">Hemlock</normalised> to Parsley;<lb/>
and many one <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> deceived therein.<lb/>
To conclude, if wee desire to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> a<lb/>
<normalised orig="rationall" auto="true">rational</normalised> Judgement on Faith in others, and<lb/>
Piety in their hearts: Let us first labour<lb/>
to have true Sanctity in our <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised>. One<lb/>
<normalised orig="complayned" auto="true">complained</normalised> to a Philosopher; that it was<lb/>
an hard thing to find a wise man. It is<lb/>
true (said <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised>) for <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> must first <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> a wise<lb/>

<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> found him: So that on the matter,<lb/>
it is not one wise man, but two wise<lb/>
men, must <normalised orig="meete" auto="true">meet</normalised> together. So it is an hard<lb/>
thing to know true Sanctity in another<lb/>
man; because <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> must have true Piety in<lb/>
<normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, that <normalised orig="knowes" auto="true">knows</normalised> it, or else <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> is an<lb/>
