In the text you may observe a Conjunction<lb/>
and a division: a Conjunction, here are two<lb/>
together that should be asunder, <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised> and<lb/>
<notvariant>Leah</notvariant>. And in the morning behold it was <notvariant>Leah</notvariant>.<lb/>
A division, <normalised orig="heere" auto="true">here</normalised> are two asunder that should<lb/>
be together, <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised> and Rachel: and first of the<lb/>
Conjunction as fittest for this season, and opportunity;<lb/>
you have <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> the quality of this conjunction, it was an ill<lb/>
Conjunction, a great <normalised orig="deale" auto="true">deal</normalised> of deceit in it, and where is there<lb/>
a Conjunction, a Marriage, but there is deceit in it, and<lb/>
least this deceit should cause a separation, the Church<lb/>
<normalised orig="bindeth" auto="true">binds</normalised> them together before God and man, for better for<lb/>
worse, for richer for poorer. And <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> this course were<lb/>
taken, how <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> would there be a partition, their qualities<lb/>
being almost as different as heaven and hell, as the good<lb/>
Angels and the <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised>. Nabal and Abigail, Nabal a fool and<lb/>
<normalised orig="churle" auto="true">churl</normalised>, and of so base a disposition, such a man of Belial,<lb/>
that his own servants said a man could not tell how to speak<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="2">A3</fw>

                  <lb/>
to him: and she a <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> <normalised orig="complementall" auto="true">complemental</normalised> woman, she fell at<lb/>
Davids feet, and offered to wash the feet of his servants. David<lb/>
and Michal, Michal a scoffing woman, deriding David<lb/>
for dancing before the <normalised orig="Arke" auto="true">Arc</normalised>, and he a man after Gods own<lb/>
heart; Socrates with Xantippe, she is like a Quotidian Ague,<lb/>
or at the best she is like Sauls <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> spirit that comes too<lb/>
often upon him. Moses and Zipporah, she a terrible <normalised orig="firie" auto="true">fiery</normalised><lb/>
woman, Thou art a <normalised orig="bloudy" auto="true">bloody</normalised> husband to me, saith she, and Moses<lb/>
the meekest man above all the men of the earth. The learned<lb/>
distinguish a fourfold deceit in Marriage, the first is<lb/>
                  error personæ, when <notvariant>Leah</notvariant> is given in stead of Rachel, one<lb/>
party for another, as to <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised>, and this mistake <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> hinder<lb/>
and <normalised orig="nullifie" auto="true">nullify</normalised> <normalised orig="Mariage" auto="true">Marriage</normalised>: for in <normalised orig="Mariage" auto="true">Marriage</normalised> there is a <normalised orig="mutuall" auto="true">mutual</normalised> love<lb/>
and consent One to another, but this is not where <notvariant>Leah</notvariant> is<lb/>
given in stead of Rachel, and therefore no <normalised orig="Mariage" auto="true">Marriage</normalised>. But will<lb/>
some say, is it possible that <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised> (who was so <normalised orig="subtill" auto="true">subtle</normalised> a man)<lb/>
should be so deceived, he was noted for a supplanter by<lb/>
his Brother <notvariant>Esau</notvariant>; Is he not rightly called <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised>, for he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised><lb/>
supplanted me these two times of my birthright and blessing.<lb/>
He was so grave, so arch a supplanter, that he could<lb/>
deceive his father although his <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> <normalised orig="betraied" auto="true">betrayed</normalised> him, and although<lb/>
his father told him it was the <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised> of <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised>, yet he<lb/>
pressed him to <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> him in stead of his brother <notvariant>Esau</notvariant>. We<lb/>
say that man is an excellent <notvariant>Hocus-Pocus</notvariant>, excellent in <normalised orig="legerdemaine" auto="true">legerdemain</normalised>,<lb/>
and slight of hand that can deceive one that looks<lb/>
upon him. But he that can deceive the hearing, and the<lb/>
feeling, he is far more excellent: my sight may be deceived<lb/>
for I may take that which is Pictured to be lively and<lb/>
real, but my hearing, my feeling cannot be so easily <normalised orig="deceiv'd" auto="true">deceived</normalised>.<lb/>
Thomas would not <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> his seeing, his hearing, but when<lb/>
he came to feeling to lay his hand in our Saviours side, then<lb/>
he cried out, My Lord and my God. And now I suppose you<lb/>
are ready to ask, how this <normalised orig="Subtil" auto="true">Subtle</normalised> man was deceived? The deceit<lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
was thus, <normalised orig="solem" auto="true">solemn</normalised> olim sponsa obvelata facie traduci ad torum<lb/>
mortalem pudoris causa. In those <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> the Brides came veiled<lb/>
and Masked to their Marriage Beds, for modesty sake, and<lb/>
it was a <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> of Modesty to be silent. And thus much for the<lb/>
first deceit, which is error personæ, a mistake of the person,<lb/>
as this text represents to you. There is another deceit, which<lb/>
is error qualitatis, when a man takes as he <normalised orig="thinkes" auto="true">thinks</normalised> he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised>,<lb/>
one thrifty honest, <normalised orig="faire" auto="true">fair</normalised>, and she proves a painted <normalised orig="whorish" auto="true">whoorish</normalised>,<lb/>
liquorish slut. And this deceit is <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised>, for many women<lb/>
<normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> like the Egyptian Temples, very <normalised orig="beautifull" auto="true">beautiful</normalised> without<lb/>
and built, and adorned with precious stones, saith, Lucian,<lb/>
but if you seek what god they worship within, you shall<lb/>
<normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> him to be a Cat, or a Goat, or an Ape, or some such<lb/>
ridiculous ill favoured creature: so, many women, although<lb/>
they be <normalised orig="faire" auto="true">fair</normalised> and <normalised orig="beautifull" auto="true">beautiful</normalised> without, are full of many vanities,<lb/>
fickle, unconstant, lascivious affections: many a man<lb/>
thinks he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a saint, when he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised>, a <normalised orig="faire" auto="true">fair</normalised> woman,<lb/>
when she is a painted <normalised orig="plaistered" auto="true">plastered</normalised> faced Iesabel; I will<lb/>
not speak of these painted <normalised orig="tombes" auto="true">tombs</normalised> and sepulchres, <normalised orig="beautifull" auto="true">beautiful</normalised><lb/>
without, but loathsome within, these Apples of Sodom,<lb/>
that <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> <normalised orig="faire" auto="true">fair</normalised> to the sight but at the least touch they fall<lb/>
to dust: so the least approaching discovers the corruption<lb/>
of these creatures, so great is their corruption it corrupts<lb/>
the sweetest perfumes, and makes them loathsome as themselves:<lb/>
but I will not rake any longer in this <normalised orig="unsavory" auto="true">unsavoury</normalised> dunghill.<lb/>
There are two other <normalised orig="errours" auto="true">errors</normalised>, or deceits in Marriage, as<lb/>
                  error Conditionis, and error fortunæ: but I let them <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised>, for<lb/>
<normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised> I should run into the <normalised orig="errour" auto="true">error</normalised> of being tedious to this<lb/>
assembly. I come now to the division, or separation; there is<lb/>
discovery of an ill Conjunction, therefore I will cast my<lb/>
meditations a little upon this appearance, or discovery of<lb/>
this Conjunction, In the morning behold it was <notvariant>Leah</notvariant>. There<lb/>
is many a man sleeps with <notvariant>Leah</notvariant> and thinks it is Rachel, there<lb/>
is many a man so blinded in his love &amp; affection that he is as<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
much or more mistaken in the qualities of his wife then<lb/>
<normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised> was in the person of <notvariant>Leah</notvariant>: many a man thinks he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised><lb/>
a wife that loves him, when she cares not for him, and <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised><lb/>
may think that she is sighing and sorrowing in his absence,<lb/>
when she is Revelling and Dancing. You may read Pro.<lb/>
7.18. there's a woman speaks to a man in her husbands absence<lb/>
to take his fill of love with her: he (may be) thinks, she<lb/>
is weeping in his absence, when she is tumbling in her<lb/>
perfumed bed, as you may read there, verse 17. <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 7.16-17">I have perfumed<lb/>
my bed with <normalised orig="Myrrhe" auto="true">Myrrh</normalised>, Aloes and <normalised orig="Cynamon" auto="false">Cinnamon</normalised>; I have decked<lb/>
it with coverings of tapestry, and fine <normalised orig="linnen" auto="true">linen</normalised> of Egypt</quote>: no<lb/>
question this woman embraces her husband when he comes<lb/>
home, and he discovers nothing: for the way of an <normalised orig="whorish" auto="true">whoorish</normalised><lb/>
woman, (as Solomon saith) is like <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 30.19">the flight of a Bird in the<lb/>
<normalised orig="aire" auto="true">air</normalised>, like the passage of a ship upon the sea, like a serpent creeping<lb/>
into a <normalised orig="rocke" auto="true">rock</normalised></quote>: no <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> of the birds flying, of the serpents<lb/>
creeping, of the ships passage.<lb/>
Look upon Ioseph's <normalised orig="Mistresse" auto="true">Mistress</normalised>, she <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> his coat to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised><lb/>
for honesty, <notvariant>Ecce</notvariant> signum, Behold the coat of this Hebrew: did<lb/>
Sampson <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> those hands would have clipped his <normalised orig="lockes" auto="true">locks</normalised>,<lb/>
that had so often embraced his body? Some rash men do<lb/>
maintain, that the reason why men <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> there are so many<lb/>
good women, is, because they are so <normalised orig="blinde" auto="true">blind</normalised> and ignorant<lb/>
themselves; if they had but the eyes of the Wise, to see with<lb/>
Solomons eyes, may be they would say, There was not one<lb/>
good of a thousand, and he had told them one by one. And<lb/>
how does Solomon define a good woman? just as the Philosopher<lb/>
does, Vacuum ex supposito quod detur; if there be a Vacuum, it is Locus non repletus corpore; if there be, or shall<lb/>
ever be such a thing in the world as a good woman, then she<lb/>
is this and that, she is like a merchants Ship that <normalised orig="bringeth" auto="true">brings</normalised><lb/>
her food from far: and what of greater value ! she is like to<lb/>
precious jewels, she is like to them, but there is none like<lb/>
to her, none of equal value with her. Solomon saith, She is a<lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="crowne" auto="true">crown</normalised> to her husband, she is the glory of her husband, saith<lb/>
Saint Paul, the very <normalised orig="skarlet" auto="true">scarlet</normalised> she <normalised orig="cloathes" auto="true">clothes</normalised> her servants in does<lb/>
<normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> her honourable, God <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> <normalised orig="cals" auto="true">calls</normalised> her an helper, and<lb/>
such a helper she is, that man could not have been capable<lb/>
of that blessing, Increase and multiply, without her, then it<lb/>
was The Seed of the woman that brake the Serpents head: she<lb/>
was Deipora, she brought forth a God, and here I will be<lb/>
bold to say out of the due honour to that <normalised orig="Sexe" auto="true">Sex</normalised>, that there<lb/>
have been women have deserved these praises of Solomon:<lb/>
What was that Ester? that <normalised orig="Cherubin" auto="true">Cherubim</normalised> of the Church under<lb/>
whose wings it was safe: the Papists call the Virgin Mary,<lb/>
                  Regina C(li, Queen of Heaven, and they pray to her to<lb/>
command our Saviour, <normalised orig="Mater" auto="true">Matter</normalised> impera Filio, Mother command<lb/>
thy Son; She <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> more Churches dedicated to her<lb/>
than our Saviour, than all the Trinity, although she paid<lb/>
her Fine in <normalised orig="milke" auto="true">milk</normalised>, but He in blood, (as a great Divine<lb/>
saith.) How happy <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> this Kingdom been under a Queen,<lb/>
there are many eyes now living that have seen it, and not a<lb/>
man but <normalised orig="knowes" auto="true">knows</normalised> it; I need not instance in particulars the<lb/>
elect Lady and her sister, to whom Saint <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> writ, <notvariant>Priscilla</notvariant><lb/>
able to <normalised orig="informe" auto="true">inform</normalised> a learned man Apollos in the Scripture:<lb/>
these women were highly honoured by that Apostle called<lb/>
from Heaven, <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 16.3"><normalised orig="Greete" auto="true">Greet</normalised> <notvariant>Priscilla</notvariant> and <notvariant>Aquila</notvariant></quote> <normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>. 16.3. <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 16.19"><notvariant>Aquila</notvariant><lb/>

2. Tim.4.19. <quote type="biblical" ana="Acts 18.18"><notvariant>Priscilla</notvariant> went with him into Syria</quote> Act. 18.18.<lb/>
and thus much for the discovery, how long may a man sleep<lb/>
before he <normalised orig="knowes" auto="true">knows</normalised> with whom, or what she is he sleeps <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>,<lb/>
before he knows whether it be <notvariant>Leah</notvariant> or Rachel. I am<lb/>
come now to the division or separation, and you see it is<lb/>
a high and great division, <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised> begins to word it, to fall to<lb/>
<normalised orig="termes" auto="true">terms</normalised> with <notvariant>Laban</notvariant> (who was his Master) What is this thou<lb/>
<normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> done unto me; did not I serve with thee for Rachel?<lb/>
wherefore then <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> thou beguiled me? And indeed the inconveniences<lb/>

                  <lb/>
were very many that befell <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised> by this wicked<lb/>
act of <notvariant>Laban</notvariant>: first of all he made his daughter a whore,<lb/>
and a whore is odious to the children of God, she was either<lb/>
to be burnt, or to be stoned. Then the wrong done to Rachel,<lb/>
being deceived of her expectation, was enough to make her<lb/>
<normalised orig="weepe" auto="true">weep</normalised> her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> <normalised orig="blear" auto="false">blare</normalised> <normalised orig="ey'd" auto="true">eyed</normalised> like <notvariant>Leah</notvariant>, then he brought an inconvenience<lb/>
upon <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised>, having more wives then one, some<lb/>
say it was a sin, some hold it a great Inconvenience to have<lb/>
one, therefore much more to have two.<lb/>
The married man is <normalised orig="intangled" auto="true">entangled</normalised> like a fish in a net; he<lb/>
comes merrily in, but he is mightily <normalised orig="perplext" auto="true">perplexed</normalised> when he cannot<lb/>
get out: then this action of <notvariant>Laban</notvariant> was enough to set the<lb/>
sisters at variance, and what joy could <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised> have when his<lb/>
wives were <normalised orig="devided" auto="true">divided</normalised>, it was enough to <normalised orig="devide" auto="true">divide</normalised> his heart: then<lb/>
the desire of rule, and <choice ana="illegible">

I will not say, it was a <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised> to have many wives, for I <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised><lb/>
it in the Law, <normalised orig="Deut" auto="true">Deuteronomy</normalised>. 21. 15. <quote type="biblical" ana="Deut 21.15">If a man have two wives, one<lb/>

<normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised>: was it not a great <normalised orig="kindnesse" auto="true">kindness</normalised> in <notvariant>Laban</notvariant> to take <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised>, <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised><lb/>

his daughter, and for ought I know the better of the two, the<lb/>
fairest is not <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> the best, <normalised orig="Beautifull" auto="true">Beautiful</normalised> Rachel sold <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised><lb/>
for Mandrakes, whereas <normalised orig="blear" auto="false">blare</normalised> eyed <notvariant>Leah</notvariant> bought him and<lb/>
went out to meet him, Gen. 30.16. Tender eyed <notvariant>Leah</notvariant> will<lb/>
be weeping at my misfortunes, when <normalised orig="beautifull" auto="true">beautiful</normalised> Rachel will<lb/>
be laughing with another: Abraham went in danger with<lb/>
beautiful Sarah, but <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised> <normalised orig="liveth" auto="true">lives</normalised> secure with tender eyed<lb/>
<notvariant>Leah</notvariant>, Rachel stole her fathers gods, and could see her Father<lb/>

weeping, Rachel will be impatient if she have not what she<lb/>

with such <normalised orig="disquietnesse" auto="true">disquietness</normalised>, but like a <normalised orig="faire" auto="true">fair</normalised> house haunted with<lb/>

<notvariant>Leah</notvariant> she is more moderate, tender eyed, she will be weeping<lb/>
in stead of <normalised orig="scoulding" auto="true">scolding</normalised>, Rachel will be subject to be wandering<lb/>

beauty, there is more danger in it then in the most unruly<lb/>
Elements, the fire <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> no power of a man if he do not touch<lb/>
it; nor the water; but if a man look but upon beauty, it will<lb/>

<notvariant>Leah</notvariant> against <normalised orig="beautifull" auto="true">beautiful</normalised> Rachel, Leahs fault was great in lying<lb/>
with <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised>. To this I answer, fornication was held no sin<lb/>

non vagam, that if a man keep constantly to one<lb/>
woman it is no <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>: and <normalised orig="heer" auto="true">hair</normalised> let no man be harsh against<lb/>
<notvariant>Leah</notvariant>, for she is tender eyed, and can weep <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised> enough to<lb/>

alas, be not harsh against her, she is <normalised orig="blear" auto="false">blare</normalised> eyed already &amp; too<lb/>
much weeping will make her <normalised orig="blinde" auto="true">blind</normalised>, what if <notvariant>Leah</notvariant> have a<lb/>

rightly, the greatest deformity and blemish in a woman<lb/>
is, to be <normalised orig="bleare" auto="true">blear</normalised> eyed in her understanding, to mistake a<lb/>
mans actions, not to see them clearly, if her husband be sociable,<lb/>
then he is given to <normalised orig="drunkennes" auto="true">drunkenness</normalised>, if silent, then he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> no<lb/>

him, if he put not <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> upon hard adventures to raise<lb/>
his fortunes, she is disquieted, and if he <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>, and be <normalised orig="foyled" auto="true">foiled</normalised>,<lb/>
then she <normalised orig="contemnes" auto="true">contemns</normalised> him; give me the eye of the understanding,<lb/>
let the other eye be as <normalised orig="cleare" auto="true">clear</normalised> as <normalised orig="Christal" auto="true">Crystal</normalised>, if this be<lb/>
<normalised orig="blemisht" auto="true">blemished</normalised> there is no joy. For ought I know, this <notvariant>Laban</notvariant>, this<lb/>
Idolater, shall rise up against many Christians: how <normalised orig="usuall" auto="true">usual</normalised> is<lb/>
it, for many a man to make <normalised orig="faire" auto="true">fair</normalised> promises, to promise a man<lb/>
Rachel, he shall have this and that, and any thing his heart<lb/>
can desire if he will serve them, but when a man <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> done<lb/>
all he can, they will put <notvariant>Leah</notvariant> upon him, some <normalised orig="bleare" auto="true">blear</normalised> eyed<lb/>
unhandsome thing, upon which so soon as a man can but<lb/>
look, he shall <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> it to be <notvariant>Leah</notvariant>, it's <normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised> enough to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised><lb/>
seen, behold it was <notvariant>Leah</notvariant>, it is a hard thing for a man to get<lb/>
a Rachel of his Master, to get any thing that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> any delight<lb/>
or pleasure in it, great men will not part with their Rachels.<lb/>
And still I say, this <notvariant>Laban</notvariant> had more honesty and<lb/>

                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="goodnes" auto="true">goodness</normalised> then many a Christian, for although he had done<lb/>
<normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised> a little wrong, yet he had so much <normalised orig="mildnes" auto="true">mildness</normalised>, and <normalised orig="Gentlenes" auto="true">Gentleness</normalised>,<lb/>
and Gentility, as he did suffer <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised> to speak to him<lb/>
and to tell him of it, why <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> thou beguiled me thus. Now<lb/>
there are rich men, if they have done a man a displeasure,<lb/>
will not be told of it. Nay if a <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> man trust a rich man<lb/>
with money, if he be not disposed to give it, or is unwilling,<lb/>

<normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised> that may be, and what is this but like <normalised orig="theeves" auto="true">thieves</normalised> that<lb/>

that he shall not speak, or like Rogues that <normalised orig="murther" auto="true">murder</normalised> a man<lb/>
because they shall not betray them; God send me to <normalised orig="deale" auto="true">deal</normalised><lb/>
with <notvariant>Laban</notvariant>, with an Idolater, I shall <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> a man that I dare<lb/>

God complained of his <normalised orig="vinyard" auto="true">vineyard</normalised>, that when he had taken<lb/>

wilde grapes, the Basest actions of men, I make no question<lb/>
but men would <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> the same judgement that David did<lb/>
upon the rich man that <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> the poor mans <normalised orig="Lambe" auto="true">Lamb</normalised>. And<lb/>
<normalised orig="heer" auto="true">hair</normalised> let every man be exhorted not to deceive his servant<lb/>
or his kinsman or his friend, <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised> for deceiving his brother<lb/>
&amp; his Father, was paid in his own <normalised orig="Coyn" auto="true">Coin</normalised>, &amp; enjoyed not the<lb/>

<notvariant>Laban</notvariant> for deceiving <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised>, was deceived by <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised>, with the<lb/>
rods he laid. Rachel stole Labans gods for deceiving her of<lb/>
her husband at first. <normalised orig="Iacob" auto="true">Jacob</normalised> deceived his Father with Goats<lb/>
skins, and he <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> was deceived with the blood of a<lb/>
Goat. David cut off the lap of Sauls coat, and his clothes<lb/>
would not keep him <normalised orig="warme" auto="true">warm</normalised> in his old age. Sampsons eye<lb/>

                  <lb/>
hand reached to the Prophet, and that hand withered,<lb/>
Thus you see how God <normalised orig="punisheth" auto="true">punishes</normalised> sin in the same act, in the<lb/>

thinks it is Rachel, (very <normalised orig="beautifull" auto="true">beautiful</normalised>) and loves it entirely,<lb/>
till the morning light of Gods grace arise, and then<lb/>
he sees the deformity of his sin, how <normalised orig="bleare" auto="true">blear</normalised> eyed it is, how<lb/>
ill-favoured, and now let every man consider how we are all<lb/>
servants to God, and we serve him for Rachel, for some pleasant<lb/>
thing we delight in, as the Apostles <normalised orig="dream't" auto="false">dreamed</normalised> of a <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised>,<lb/>
if it please God to give us <notvariant>Leah</notvariant>, in stead of Rachel, to<lb/>
give us that which <normalised orig="pleaseth" auto="true">pleases</normalised> us not so well, let us be content<lb/>
with it and serve him on still, he will at the last give us Rachel,<lb/>
we shall be married to him in whom are all joys, such<lb/>
