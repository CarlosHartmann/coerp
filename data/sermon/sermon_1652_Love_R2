EPHES. 2. 12.<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.12">That at that time <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> were without<lb/>
Christ, being Aliens from the Common-wealth<lb/>

                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
THis Chapter out of which my<lb/>
Text is taken, is like a little<lb/>
Map, containing in it a description<lb/>
of the little world<lb/>
Man, and that in a double<lb/>
capacity; considering man either in the<lb/>
state of Grace, or in the state of Nature; If<lb/>
you consider Man in the first capacity, in<lb/>
the state of Grace, this chapter <normalised orig="layes" auto="true">lays</normalised> down<lb/>
a five fold description of bringing Man<lb/>
into the state of Grace.<lb/>
1. Here is laid down the efficient cause<lb/>
of bringing Man out of the state of Nature,<lb/>
into the state of Grace, and that is<lb/>
God, in the 4. <normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="2">B</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
2. Here is laid down the impulsive cause,<lb/>
and that is the riches of Gods mercy in<lb/>
the same verse, <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.4">But God who is rich in<lb/>
mercy for the great love wherewith he loved<lb/>
us, &amp;c.</quote>
                  <lb/>
3. Here is laid down the meritorious<lb/>
cause of it, which is Christ in his sufferings,<lb/>
in the 7. verse, <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.7">that in the ages to come,<lb/>
he might <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> the exceeding riches of his grace<lb/>
in his <normalised orig="kindnesse" auto="true">kindness</normalised> towards us, through Jesus<lb/>
Christ.</quote>
                  <lb/>
4. Here is laid down the <normalised orig="finall" auto="true">final</normalised> cause of<lb/>
it in the same verse also, <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.7">that in Ages to<lb/>
come, he might <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> the exceeding riches of his<lb/>
grace.</quote> And,<lb/>
Lastly, here is the <normalised orig="instrumentall" auto="true">instrumental</normalised> cause of<lb/>
bringing man out of the state of Nature<lb/>
into the state of Grace, and that is Faith,<lb/>
in the 8. verse: <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.8">For by grace are you saved<lb/>
through Faith, and that not of your selves, it is<lb/>
the gift of God.</quote>
                  <lb/>
Now the other part of the Map describes<lb/>
man in the second capacity, in the<lb/>
state of Nature, and herein it gives a two-fold<lb/>
description of Mans condition;<lb/>
1. Positively, what he is.<lb/>
2. Privatively, what he wants.<lb/>
1. It describes Man in the state of Nature<lb/>
positively what he is, and that in five<lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*r*iculars</sic>
                     <corr>particulars</corr>
                  </choice>;<lb/>
1. Men in their <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised> condition, are<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
described to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.1">dead in trespasses and<lb/>
<normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised></quote>.<lb/>
2. They <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.2">walk according to the course of this<lb/>
world</quote>, as Pagans and Heathens do.<lb/>
3. <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.2">According to the Prince of the power of the<lb/>
air</quote>, that is, the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised>; now the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> is<lb/>
called the Prince of the air, either because<lb/>
he <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> reside in the air, or else, because<lb/>
he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> the power of the <normalised orig="winde" auto="true">wind</normalised> and of<lb/>
the air.<lb/>
4. They are called <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.2">Children of disobedience</quote>;<lb/>
that is, born in a state of disobedience<lb/>
quite contrary to the commands of<lb/>
God.<lb/>
5. That they <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.3"><normalised orig="fulfill" auto="true">fulfil</normalised> the lusts of the flesh and<lb/>
of the <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised></quote>, and are <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.3">by nature children of<lb/>
wrath</quote>.<lb/>
Thus far you have the positive description<lb/>
of Man in the state of Nature.<lb/>
2. Now in the second place, the Apostle<lb/>
describes him privatively what he wants;<lb/>
and that in the words of my Text, in<lb/>
five particulars, wherein <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> plainly<lb/>
<normalised orig="shews" auto="true">shows</normalised> that he is the poorest man in the<lb/>
world that wants Jesus Christ, and the<lb/>
most miserable: That at that time you<lb/>
were without Christ; that is the first: You<lb/>
were <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.12">Aliens from the Common-wealth of Israel</quote>;<lb/>
that is the second: You were <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.12">strangers to<lb/>
the Covenant of promise</quote>; that is the third:<lb/>
You were without hope; that is the fourth:<lb/>
And you were <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.12">without God in the world</quote>;<lb/>
that's the <normalised orig="fift" auto="true">fifth</normalised>.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="4">B2</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
Now these comprehensive expressions,<lb/>
contain in them the whole misery of<lb/>
Man, and that in these five particulars<lb/>
here named; 2. here is described the time<lb/>
how long, a man is in this condition,<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.12">that at that time</quote>, that is, the time during<lb/>
your unconverted estate; as long as you<lb/>
are unconverted, so long you are without<lb/>
Christ, and an Alien from the Common-wealth<lb/>
of Israel, and a stranger to<lb/>
the Covenants of promise, without hope<lb/>
and without God in the world.<lb/>
And now what a <normalised orig="dismall" auto="true">dismal</normalised> Text have I<lb/>
here to handle, and what a doleful tragedy<lb/>
am I now to act? but yet out of<lb/>
every one of these, there is a great deal<lb/>
of comfort which may flow forth; I shall<lb/>
only at present make entrance into the<lb/>
words, and speak more fully to them<lb/>
afterwards; <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.12">that at that time you were without<lb/>
Christ;</quote> That at that time: Beloved here<lb/>
wants something to supply the sense of<lb/>
the words, and therefore read the foregoing<lb/>
words, and you will <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> what<lb/>
must be brought in; the verse before runs<lb/>
thus, <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.11">Wherefore remember, that you being in<lb/>
time: past Gentiles in the flesh</quote>, &amp;c.<lb/>
wherefore<lb/>
remember, these words must be <normalised orig="prefixt" auto="true">prefixed</normalised>;<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.11-12">Wherefore remember, that at that time you were<lb/>
without Christ, and aliens to the Common-wealth<lb/>
of Israel</quote>, &amp;c. I shall here by the<lb/>
way only draw out this one doctrine<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
from the coherence of the words, <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.11-12">Wherefore<lb/>
remember that at that time;</quote> the Apostle<lb/>
would have these converted Ephesians to<lb/>
remember, that they were men without<lb/>
Christ, and aliens to the Common-wealth<lb/>
of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of<lb/>
promise, without hope, and without God<lb/>
in the world: now from hence I would<lb/>
commend this observation to you.<lb/>
That it is the will of God that men in a converted<lb/>
estate should often call to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> the <normalised orig="sinfulnesse" auto="true">sinfulness</normalised><lb/>
and misery they were guilty of before their<lb/>
conversion.<lb/>
Beloved, this is a subject I could never<lb/>
have occasion to speak to you of before,<lb/>
and yet it is a point of admirable use,<lb/>
especially in these times, wherein people<lb/>
think that when once they are brought<lb/>
into a state of Grace, they must live in<lb/>
divine raptures, and revelations, and <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="joyes" auto="true">joys</normalised>, above duties and ordinances,<lb/>
and never look back into their former<lb/>
<normalised orig="sinfulnesse" auto="true">sinfulness</normalised> and <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised> they<lb/>
were guilty of before their conversion:<lb/>
Why, here the Ephesians were converted<lb/>
men, and had extraordinary <normalised orig="priviledges" auto="true">privileges</normalised>,<lb/>
they were brought <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.6">to sit in heavenly places<lb/>
in Christ Jesus</quote>; and yet the Apostle bids<lb/>
them remember their former <normalised orig="sinfulnesse" auto="true">sinfulness</normalised><lb/>
and misery, Remember O you Ephesians<lb/>
that <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> were once without Christ, and<lb/>
you were Aliens to the Common-wealth<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="6">B3</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
of Israel, &amp;c. therefore you must take<lb/>
heed of this, to think that when you are<lb/>
converted, you must be only rapt up into<lb/>
the third heavens, and never look back<lb/>
into your former condition; you see here<lb/>
the Apostle bids you remember what you<lb/>
were at that time during your unconverted<lb/>
estate, <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.12">that you were then without<lb/>
Christ, and strangers to the Covenants<lb/>
of promise, &amp;c.</quote> So that you see it is<lb/>
the will of God, that men in a converted<lb/>
estate should often <normalised orig="cal" auto="true">call</normalised> to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> the<lb/>
sins and <normalised orig="miserie" auto="true">misery</normalised> they were in before conversion.<lb/>
Now before I come to give you the<lb/>
Reasons of the point, give me leave to<lb/>
promise these three Cautions; when I tell<lb/>
you, that after your <normalised orig="co~version" auto="true">conversion</normalised>, you should<lb/>
call to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> your sin and misery before<lb/>
conversion, you must not do it 1. with<lb/>
complacency of spirit; nor 2. with stupidity<lb/>
of heart; nor 3. with despondency of<lb/>
<normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>.<lb/>
1. You must not <normalised orig="cal" auto="true">call</normalised> to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> your<lb/>
former <normalised orig="sinfulnesse" auto="true">sinfulness</normalised> with complacency of<lb/>
spirit, to please your <normalised orig="humors" auto="true">humours</normalised>; you must<lb/>
not do as some great men use to do, that<lb/>
have been guilty of great and crying sins;<lb/>
as adultery, <normalised orig="drunkennesse" auto="true">drunkenness</normalised>, swearing, and<lb/>
the like, in their youth; go tell and<lb/>
boast of them in their age; this is a very<lb/>
great <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised>: you must call to<lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> your former <normalised orig="sinfulnesse" auto="true">sinfulness</normalised> not with<lb/>
complacency, but with <normalised orig="bitternesse" auto="true">bitterness</normalised> of spirit,<lb/>
with grief, sorrow, and perplexity<lb/>
of heart: Many men will tel you large<lb/>
stories of the <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised>, that they have<lb/>
committed; but they do it with delight,<lb/>
and if they had strength and abilities, they<lb/>
would be guilty of the same sins and<lb/>
<normalised orig="wickednesses" auto="false">wickedness</normalised> <normalised orig="stil" auto="true">still</normalised>; which is a most ungodly<lb/>
practise, and that which the Scripture<lb/>
condemns men for, as in the 23. of<lb/>
Ezek. 23.19,21. <quote type="biblical" ana="Ezek 23.19">Yet she <normalised orig="multiplyed" auto="true">multiplied</normalised> her <normalised orig="whoredomes" auto="true">whoredoms</normalised>,<lb/>
in calling to remembrance the <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> of<lb/>
her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in<lb/>
the land of Egypt</quote>; <quote type="biblical" ana="Ezek 23.121">Thus thou<lb/>
<normalised orig="calledst" auto="true">called</normalised> to remembrance<lb/>
the <normalised orig="lewdnesse" auto="true">lewdness</normalised> of thy youth:</quote> the meaning<lb/>
of this is, she called her sins to remembrance,<lb/>
but it was so as to play the<lb/>
whore <normalised orig="stil" auto="true">still</normalised>, and to be unclean <normalised orig="stil" auto="true">still</normalised>, she<lb/>
did it with delight and complacency,<lb/>
with content and joy; now I say you<lb/>
should call your sins to remembrance<lb/>
with a great deal of grief and sorrow; and<lb/>
<normalised orig="bitternesse" auto="true">bitterness</normalised> of spirit: and therefore when<lb/>
young gallants <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> boast of their sins,<lb/>
and tel how often they have been drunk,<lb/>
and have made others to be so; and how<lb/>
often they have plaid the whoremaster,<lb/>
and have drawn others to do so; this is a<lb/>
most Diabolical remembrance.<lb/>
2. You must not <normalised orig="cal" auto="true">call</normalised> your former sins<lb/>
to remembrance, with stupidity of<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="8">B4</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
heart neither: Beloved, there are many<lb/>
men can remember what lewd courses<lb/>
they have taken, and what wicked lives<lb/>
they have lived; how often they have<lb/>
been drunk and unclean, and the like;<lb/>
and yet are never troubled at the remembrance<lb/>
of it; their hearts do not smite<lb/>
them with remorse and sorrow, but are<lb/>
like a rock; the sense of sin never troubles<lb/>
them: this is no way of calling sin<lb/>
to remembrance, with a blockish and stupid<lb/>
heart, this is not thanks worthy;<lb/>
but it must be done with a broken, and a<lb/>
bleeding, and a contrite heart: And,<lb/>
3. Take in this caution too, it must<lb/>
not be done with despondency of <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised><lb/>
neither. There are many converted<lb/>
ones, that do <normalised orig="cal" auto="true">call</normalised> their sins to remembrance,<lb/>
but it makes them discouraged<lb/>
and unwilling to come to Christ, it makes<lb/>
them think that they have no interest in<lb/>
the covenant of grace; but this should<lb/>
not be, the true effect that the consideration<lb/>
of your former <normalised orig="sinfulnesse" auto="true">sinfulness</normalised> should<lb/>
produce, should be your laying your<lb/>
souls low, and making them humble, and<lb/>
the more sensible of that indispensable<lb/>
need you have of Christ, of going unto<lb/>
him for salvation and comfort.<lb/>
These are the Cautions necessary to be<lb/>
premised; I come now to give you the<lb/>
Reasons of the point, why it is the will<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="9">8</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
of God, that people in a converted<lb/>
estate, should often <normalised orig="cal" auto="true">call</normalised> to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> the sin<lb/>
and misery they were in before conversion,<lb/>
and 1. God will have it so, because<lb/>
by so doing, you will be provoked the<lb/>
more highly to <normalised orig="magnifie" auto="true">magnify</normalised> and admire the<lb/>
<normalised orig="greatnesse" auto="true">greatness</normalised> and riches of Gods grace to<lb/>
you; there are none in the World greater<lb/>
admirers of Gods grace and mercy,<lb/>
then those that are most studious of their<lb/>
own sin and misery: thou wilt never<lb/>
solemnly and <normalised orig="throughly" auto="true">thoroughly</normalised> <normalised orig="magnifie" auto="true">magnify</normalised> Gods<lb/>
mercy, till thou art plunged into a deep<lb/>
<normalised orig="sensiblenesse" auto="false">sensibleness</normalised> of thine own misery, till<lb/>
the Lord <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> brought thee to see in what<lb/>
a miserable and deplorable condition<lb/>
thou <normalised orig="wert" auto="true">were</normalised> in before conversion, thou wilt<lb/>
then admire and <normalised orig="magnifie" auto="true">magnify</normalised> the riches of<lb/>
Gods free grace, in bringing thee out of<lb/>
that condition, into the estate of grace, as<lb/>
in 1 Tim.1.13. the Apostle Paul when he<lb/>
would <normalised orig="magnifie" auto="true">magnify</normalised> the free grace of God to<lb/>
him, saith he, <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Tim 1.13">I was a blasphemer, and a<lb/>
persecutor, and injurious;</quote> and yet<lb/>
through<lb/>
the abundance of Gods free grace and mercy,<lb/>
I have obtained mercy: the consideration<lb/>
of his former <normalised orig="sinfulnesse" auto="true">sinfulness</normalised> did elevate and<lb/>
<normalised orig="scrue" auto="true">screw</normalised> up his heart, to make him admire<lb/>
the free grace of God to his soul; that man<lb/>
can never prize liberty as he should do,<lb/>
that never was in prison: But,<lb/>
2. Another reason why God <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> have<lb/>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
it so is, because this will be as a spur to<lb/>
quicken and engage men to be more eminent<lb/>
in grace, after their conversion:<lb/>
when a man <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> frequently and seriously<lb/>
consider how <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> and sinful he was<lb/>
before conversion, it cannot but provoke<lb/>
him now to be more humble and holy,<lb/>
after his conversion. It is very observable<lb/>
in Paul, that all those sins and <normalised orig="wickednesses" auto="false">wickedness</normalised><lb/>
he was guilty of before conversion,<lb/>
he did most of all strive against, and labour<lb/>
to <normalised orig="excell" auto="true">excel</normalised> in the contrary graces after<lb/>
conversion: as first before conversion<lb/>
he did labour to hale others to prison, for<lb/>
worshipping of Christ; but after his conversion,<lb/>
he did labour to draw others to<lb/>
Christ: Act. 26. 10, 11. <quote type="biblical" ana="Acts 26.10-11">Many of the Saints<lb/>
did I shut up in prison, and gave my voice against<lb/>
them, and punished them oft in every City, and I<lb/>
was exceeding mad against them, and banished<lb/>
them into other Cities:</quote> and now you<lb/>
shall see that after conversion, Paul did labour<lb/>
to outvie in grace, that evil course<lb/>
he was in before; as before conversion,<lb/>
he did imprison those that did belong to<lb/>
Christ, so after conversion, he was shut<lb/>
up himself in prison, for the cause of<lb/>
Christ; before conversion, he gave his<lb/>
voice against the people of God, but after<lb/>
conversion, he did pray to God for them;<lb/>
before conversion, he did punish them<lb/>
often, but <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterwards</normalised> he did preach to<lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
them often; before conversion, he did<lb/>
<normalised orig="compell" auto="true">compel</normalised> men to blaspheme Christ, but<lb/>
after conversion, he was very earnest to<lb/>
<normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> people to <normalised orig="beleive" auto="true">believe</normalised> in Christ; he<lb/>
was exceeding mad against them before<lb/>
conversion, but <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterwards</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was so<lb/>
exceeding zealous for the people of God,<lb/>
that every one thought <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> had been<lb/>
mad: and lastly, before conversion he<lb/>
did persecute Saints to strange Cities,<lb/>
but afterwards he did go preaching of the<lb/>
Gospel to strange Cities: Oh my Beloved,<lb/>
let <normalised orig="Pauls" auto="true">Paul's</normalised> pattern be your rask, <normalised orig="cal" auto="true">call</normalised><lb/>
to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> your sin and <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised> in<lb/>
your unconverted condition, but so that<lb/>
it may provoke you, that now you are<lb/>
converted, you may labour to abound<lb/>
in grace, as formerly you have abounded<lb/>
in sin.<lb/>
3. Another reason why God will<lb/>
have us call to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> the sin and misery<lb/>
we were in before conversion, is, because<lb/>
this will be a means to kindle a great deal<lb/>
of pity and compassion in our souls, towards<lb/>
those that remain yet unconverted:<lb/>
this the Apostle exhorts us to in Tit.3.2,3.<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Titus 3.2">Speak <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> of no man,</quote> <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> he, <quote type="biblical" ana="Titus 3.2-3">be no brawler,<lb/>
but gentle, <normalised orig="Shewing" auto="true">Showing</normalised> all <normalised orig="meeknesse" auto="true">meekness</normalised> unto all men,<lb/>
for we our selves also were sometime foolish, disobedient,<lb/>
deceived, serving divers lusts and<lb/>
pleasures, living in malice and envy, <normalised orig="hatefull" auto="true">hateful</normalised>,<lb/>
and hating one another;</quote> as if the Apostle<lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
should have said, I Paul, and thou Titus,<lb/>
we were sinful as <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> as they, and did<lb/>
serve divers lusts as <normalised orig="wel" auto="true">well</normalised> as they once, let<lb/>
us therefore be pitiful, and merciful,<lb/>
and compassionate towards them, this<lb/>
consideration <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> greatly provoke us to<lb/>
commiserate poor sinful souls; the great<lb/>
reason why we pity them no more then<lb/>
we do, is because we do not <normalised orig="cal" auto="true">call</normalised> to mind<lb/>
our own <normalised orig="sinfulnesse" auto="true">sinfulness</normalised>, and what we were before<lb/>
conversion.<lb/>
4. Another reason may be this,<lb/>
because<lb/>
the consideration of our former misery,<lb/>
will greatly abate pride in the<lb/>
hearts of converted men; this will be a<lb/>
great means to abate and keep under<lb/>
pride, and advance humility in the hearts<lb/>
of Gods people: Beloved, a good man<lb/>
naturally is apt to be proud, we are not<lb/>
proud of our sins, but of our graces;<lb/>
pride is apt to grow in the best mans<lb/>
heart, and therefore God would have us<lb/>
sometime look back upon what we were<lb/>
in our unconverted estate, that so that<lb/>
might abate the pride of our spirits: you<lb/>
have an excellent place for this in<lb/>
Ezek. 16.3,4,5. compared with the last<lb/>
verse of that chapter. <normalised orig="Sayes" auto="true">Says</normalised> God there to<lb/>
Jerusalem, <quote type="biblical" ana="Ezek 16.3-5">Thy Birth and thy Nativity is of<lb/>
the land of Cannan; thy Father was an Amorite,<lb/>
and thy mother an Hittite; and as for thy<lb/>
Nativity, in the day that thou <normalised orig="wast" auto="false">were</normalised> born, thy<lb/>
                     <pb n="12"/>
                     <lb/>
Navill was not cut, neither <normalised orig="wert" auto="true">were</normalised> thou washed in<lb/>
water to supple thee, no eye pitied thee to do any<lb/>
of these unto thee, but thou <normalised orig="wert" auto="true">were</normalised> cast out into<lb/>
the open field, to the loathing of thy person in<lb/>
the day that thou <normalised orig="wast" auto="false">were</normalised> born</quote>; <quote type="biblical" ana="Ezek 16.63">that thou <normalised orig="maist" auto="true">may</normalised><lb/>
remember, and be confounded, and never open<lb/>
thy mouth any more, because thy shame, when<lb/>
I am pacified towards thee for all that thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised><lb/>
done, saith the Lord:</quote> They must<lb/>
remember<lb/>
their guilt and their shame when God<lb/>
is pacified towards them, and when God<lb/>
is reconciled to them; and so you have<lb/>
another place for the same purpose, in<lb/>
Ezek. 20. 43. <quote type="biblical" ana="Ezek 20.43">And there shall you remember<lb/>
your <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised>, and your doings, wherein you have<lb/>
been defiled, and you <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> loath your selves in your<lb/>
sight, for <normalised orig="al" auto="true">all</normalised> the evil that you have committed.</quote>
                  <lb/>
I remember what Plutarch relates of one<lb/>
Agathocles, who was advanced from a potters<lb/>
son, a low, mean, and contemptible<lb/>
condition, to be King of Sicilie, this man<lb/>
when he might have been served every<lb/>
day in golden dishes, yet he would <normalised orig="stil" auto="true">still</normalised><lb/>
have his provisions brought in earthen<lb/>
dishes, because <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> he, I may remember<lb/>
what I was, and what I am, a potters son,<lb/>
that so I may not be too much lifted up<lb/>
and exalted: why, so do you remember<lb/>
what you were, your Father a potter, and<lb/>
you a poor miserable <normalised orig="sinfull" auto="true">sinful</normalised> creature,<lb/>
and this will abate the pride of your<lb/>
hearts.<lb/>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
5. And lastly, God <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> have us <normalised orig="cal" auto="true">call</normalised><lb/>
to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> our former <normalised orig="sinfulnesse" auto="true">sinfulness</normalised>, because<lb/>
this <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> make us more watchful and<lb/>
circumspect, that we do not run again<lb/>
into those sins that we were guilty of<lb/>
before conversion; God would not have<lb/>
us do it, to drive us into despair, or<lb/>
to question our evidences for heaven,<lb/>
but to make us humble and watchful,<lb/>
that we run not again into the same sins.<lb/>
Thou <normalised orig="maist" auto="true">may</normalised> thus think with thy self,<lb/>
Before conversion, I spent my <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> in<lb/>
sin and <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised>, and consumed my<lb/>
years in vanity and pleasures, in fulfilling<lb/>
the lusts of the flesh and of the mind;<lb/>
and the consideration of this, will lay an<lb/>
engagement upon thy soul, to walk<lb/>
more carefully, and prudently, and holily<lb/>
in time to come; this the Apostle<lb/>
makes use of, in Ephes. 5.8. <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 5.8">You were sometimes<lb/>
<normalised orig="darknesse" auto="true">darkness</normalised></quote> (saith he) <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 5.8">but now are you light<lb/>
in the Lord, walk therefore as children of the<lb/>
light;</quote> we should now hate and <normalised orig="abhorre" auto="true">abhor</normalised><lb/>
those sins that formerly we have delighted<lb/>
in.<lb/>
These are the reasons of the point; I<lb/>
<normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> only make one short use of it;<lb/>
which <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> be of reprehension to those,<lb/>
that (notwithstanding it is the will of<lb/>
God, that men after conversion should<lb/>
<normalised orig="cal" auto="true">call</normalised> to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> the sin they were guilty of<lb/>
before conversion) do yet <normalised orig="crosse" auto="true">cross</normalised> this doctrine<lb/>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
either in their judgement, or practice.<lb/>
1. This reproves those that do contradict<lb/>
this Doctrine in their judgement, and<lb/>
think that when once they are converted,<lb/>
they must never look back upon their<lb/>
former <normalised orig="wretchednesse" auto="true">wretchedness</normalised>, but only now live<lb/>
in Divine raptures, and revelations, and<lb/>
<normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> <normalised orig="joyes" auto="true">joys</normalised>, and comforts; for, 1. If<lb/>
<normalised orig="Pauls" auto="true">Paul's</normalised> precept be warrantable, then this<lb/>
opinion is unwarrantable, for he <normalised orig="tels" auto="true">tells</normalised> us<lb/>
that we must remember what we were in<lb/>
our unconverted estate, that we were at<lb/>
that time without Christ, and without<lb/>
hope, and without God in the World.<lb/>
2. Paul <normalised orig="tels" auto="true">tells</normalised> the Ephesians, that were an<lb/>
elected people, who were elected before<lb/>
the beginning of the world, that they<lb/>
must remember that they were dead in<lb/>
trespasses and <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised> heretofore, though<lb/>
now they were quickened: and if Paul<lb/>
bids them call to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> their former<lb/>
<normalised orig="sinfulnesse" auto="true">sinfulness</normalised>, then why should not we do<lb/>
it?<lb/>
2. This reproves those that though<lb/>
they do not deny this Doctrine in judgement,<lb/>
yet do not make it their practise, to<lb/>
call to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> their former sins that they<lb/>
were guilty of before conversion: I dare<lb/>
warrant, that many of you can remember<lb/>
what you have done, and what debts<lb/>
have been owing you twenty years <normalised orig="agoe" auto="true">ago</normalised>,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="16">15</fw>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
but yet cannot <normalised orig="cal" auto="true">call</normalised> to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> what sins<lb/>
you have committed 20. <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> <normalised orig="agoe" auto="true">ago</normalised>, it<lb/>
may be some of you have been cheaters<lb/>
and swearers, adulterers and prophaners,<lb/>
and yet now you never think of it, but<lb/>
imagine all is well: I <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> not know<lb/>
how to <normalised orig="expresse" auto="true">express</normalised> what sad, <normalised orig="dismall" auto="true">dismal</normalised> and<lb/>
deplorable condition thy poor soul is in,<lb/>
thou that <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> never call to mind thy<lb/>
former sins: But thus much shall suffice<lb/>
for this first Doctrine.<lb/>
