               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
The Text will afford several points,<lb/>
but I shall only name one, which I intend<lb/>
to stand on at this time, and that is<lb/>
this.<lb/>
Doct. That God reserves the best and<lb/>
greatest favours and blessings<lb/>
for <normalised orig="beleevers" auto="true">believers</normalised> till they come to<lb/>
Heaven.<lb/>
Now I shall prove this proposition by<lb/>
an induction of particulars, and then<lb/>
give you the reasons of it; I will begin<lb/>
with the inheritance spoken of in the<lb/>
Text.<lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
1 The best inheritance is reserved for<lb/>
<normalised orig="Beleevers" auto="true">Believers</normalised> till they come to Heaven; this<lb/>
is clear and fair in the Text, yet I shall<lb/>
make this further out to you thus.<lb/>
First, The Inheritance reserved for<lb/>
<normalised orig="Beleevers" auto="true">Believers</normalised> till they come to Heaven, is<lb/>
a pure, undefiled, and incorruptible inheritance,<lb/>
it is an inheritance that cannot<lb/>
<normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> defiled, nor blemished with abuse<lb/>
one way or another, other inheritances<lb/>
may, and often are with <normalised orig="oathes" auto="true">oaths</normalised>,<lb/>
cruelty, blood, deceit, &amp;c. the Greek<lb/>
word (Amiantos) signifies a precious<lb/>
stone, which though it <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> never so much<lb/>
soiled, yet it cannot be blemished, nor<lb/>
defiled; yea, the <normalised orig="oftner" auto="true">oftener</normalised> you cast it into<lb/>
the fire, and take it out, the more clear,<lb/>
bright, and shining it is; All earthly inheritances<lb/>
are true Gardens of Adonis,<lb/>
where wee can gather nothing but trivial<lb/>
flowers, surrounded with many <normalised orig="bryars" auto="true">briars</normalised>,<lb/>
thorns, and thistles: O the hands, the<lb/>
hearts, the thoughts, the lives, that have<lb/>
been defiled, stained, and polluted with<lb/>
earthly inheritances! O the impure<lb/>
love, the carnal confidence, the vain<lb/>
boastings, the sensual <normalised orig="joyes" auto="true">joys</normalised>, that earthly<lb/>
inheritances have filled and defiled poor<lb/>
souls with; all earthly inheritances, they<lb/>
are no better than the Cities which Solomon<lb/>
gave to Hiram, which <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> called Cabul,<lb/>
that is to say, displeasing, or dirty,<lb/>
the world <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> but <normalised orig="durt" auto="true">dirt</normalised>, and dust us.<lb/>
But<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
Secondly; It is a sure, a secure inheritance,<lb/>
to an inheritance reserved in Heaven<lb/>
for you. See the Text, the Greek<lb/>
word that is here <normalised orig="rendred" auto="true">rendered</normalised> reserved, is<lb/>
from (NoValue) which signifies to<lb/>
keep solicitously, to keep, as with watch<lb/>
and ward; this inheritance is kept, and<lb/>
secured to us, by promise, by power, by<lb/>
blood, by oath, and therefore must needs<lb/>
<normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> sure; it is neither sin, nor Satan,<lb/>
nor the world that can put a Christian by<lb/>
this inheritance; Christ <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> already<lb/>
taken possession of it in their names, and<lb/>
in their rooms, and so it is secure to<lb/>
them; if <normalised orig="weaknesse" auto="true">weakness</normalised> can overcome<lb/>
strength, <normalised orig="impotency" auto="true">impotence</normalised> omnipotency, then<lb/>
may a Christian <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> kept out of his inheritance,<lb/>
but not till then; but earthly<lb/>
inheritances, they are not sure, they are<lb/>
not secure; how often <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> might overcome<lb/>
right, and the weakest go to<lb/>
the wall? how many are kept out, and<lb/>
how many are cast out of their inheritances?<lb/>
by power, policy, craft, cruelty;<lb/>
It was a complaint of old, our inheritance<lb/>
is turned to strangers, our houses<lb/>
to Aliens, James 5. 2.<lb/>
Thirdly, It is a permanent, a lasting<lb/>
inheritance; <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Pet 1.4">To an inheritance incorruptible,<lb/>
undefiled, and that <normalised orig="fadeth" auto="true">fades</normalised> not away</quote>;<lb/>
the Greek word (Amarantos) is the proper<lb/>

                  <lb/>
time hung up in the house; it is an inheritance<lb/>
that shall continue as long as<lb/>
God himself continues; of this inheritance<lb/>
there shall be no end, though other<lb/>
inheritances may <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> lasting, yet they<lb/>
are not everlasting, though (sometimes)<lb/>
it <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> long before they have an end,<lb/>
yet they have an end; where is the glory<lb/>
of the Caldean, Persian, Græcian, and<lb/>
Roman <normalised orig="Kingdomes" auto="true">Kingdoms</normalised>? but the glory of<lb/>

after <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been many thousand<lb/>
thousands of years in Heaven, as<lb/>
it was at his first entrance into it;<lb/>
Earthly inheritances are like Tennisballs,<lb/>
which are bandied up and down<lb/>
from one to another, and in time wore<lb/>
out. The creature is all shadow and<lb/>
vanity, it is (filia noctis) like Jonahs<lb/>
Gourd, man can sit under its shadow but<lb/>
a little, little while; it soon <normalised orig="decaies" auto="true">decays</normalised> and<lb/>
dies, it quickly fades and withers; there<lb/>
is a worm at the root of all earthly inheritances,<lb/>
that will consume them in<lb/>
time; all earthly comforts and contents<lb/>
are but like a fair picture that is<lb/>
drawn upon the Ice, which <normalised orig="continueth" auto="true">continues</normalised><lb/>

not, or like the morning cloud that soon<lb/>
<normalised orig="passeth" auto="true">passes</normalised> away, but a <normalised orig="Beleevers" auto="true">Believers</normalised> inheritance<lb/>
<normalised orig="indureth" auto="true">endures</normalised> for ever; when this<lb/>
world shall <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> no more, when time<lb/>

Saints shall <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> fresh, flourishing, and<lb/>
continuing, Nescio quid erit, quod ista<lb/>

                  <lb/>
will that life <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised>, or rather what will not<lb/>
that life <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised>, since all good either is not<lb/>
at all, or is in such a life; light, which<lb/>
place cannot comprehend, voices and<lb/>

odours which are never dissipated, a feast<lb/>
which is never consumed, a blessing<lb/>
which eternity <normalised orig="bestoweth" auto="true">bestows</normalised>, but eternity<lb/>
shall never see at an end; So this, all this<lb/>
is the heritage of all Gods Jacobs.<lb/>
Fourthly, It is the freest inheritance,<lb/>
it is an inheritance that is free from all<lb/>
vexation, and molestation; there shall<lb/>
<normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> no sin to molest the soul, nor no Devil<lb/>
to vex the soul; there shall <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> no<lb/>

no Jebusites to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> as pricks in your <normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised>,<lb/>
and Thorns in your sides; there shall <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised><lb/>

O the deceit of this man! O the oppression<lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
of that man! &amp;c. No, they shall<lb/>
have a Crown without <normalised orig="Thornes" auto="true">Thorns</normalised>, a Rose<lb/>
without prickles, and an inheritance<lb/>
without the least <normalised orig="incumbrance" auto="true">encumbrance</normalised>; this inheritance<lb/>
flows from free love, and is<lb/>
freely offered, though the soul <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised><lb/>
neither <normalised orig="mony" auto="true">money</normalised>, nor <normalised orig="mony" auto="true">money</normalised> worth; there<lb/>
is nothing, there is not the least thing<lb/>
about this inheritance, that is purchased<lb/>
or paid for by us; it is all frank, it is all<lb/>
free, it is all of grace; here is such an inheritance,<lb/>
that no eye ever saw, that no<lb/>
mortal ever <normalised orig="possest" auto="true">possessed</normalised>, and that for nothing;<lb/>
it is freely offered, and it is freely given,<lb/>
Act. 20.32. <quote type="biblical" ana="Acts 20.32">And now Brethren, I commend<lb/>
you to God, and to the word of his<lb/>
grace, which is able to build you up, and<lb/>
to give you an inheritance among all them<lb/>

free mercy, that God alone may have<lb/>
the glory. Other inheritances they have<lb/>

<normalised orig="Fifthly" auto="true">Fiftly</normalised>, It is an Inheritance that is<lb/>
universally communicable, to Jews, to<lb/>
Gentiles, to bond, to free, to rich, to<lb/>

Gal. 3.28, 29. <quote type="biblical" ana="Gal 3.28-29">There is neither Jew, nor<lb/>

other Countries, not all sons, but the<lb/>

their earthly inheritances, if all the Sons<lb/>

enjoyed by every <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised>, here every child<lb/>
is an heir to all, and <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> right to all. In<lb/>
earthly inheritances; the more you divide,<lb/>
the <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> is every ones part; but this<lb/>
inheritance is not diminished by the multitude<lb/>
of possessors, nor impaired by<lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
the number of co-heirs, it is as much to<lb/>
many, as to a few, and as great to one,<lb/>
as to all; not a room, not a mansion, not a<lb/>

not a smile, not a good word, not a sweet<lb/>

not a pleasure, not a delight, but is<lb/>
universally communicable, and universally<lb/>

inheritance; <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> it shall<lb/>

the best rest is reserved for <normalised orig="Beleevers" auto="true">Believers</normalised> till<lb/>

saith Anselme (Nisi per hoc vellet innuere,<lb/>

God is said to have rested; Rest is a<lb/>
Jewel very desirable on Earth, but wee<lb/>
shall not wear it in our <normalised orig="bosomes" auto="true">bosoms</normalised> till wee<lb/>
come to Heaven. Ambrose well observes<lb/>
that (<lb/>
                  sex diebus mundus est factus,<lb/>
septimo requietum est die; ultra mundum<lb/>
ergo est quies, ultra mundum etiam fructus<lb/>

                  <lb/>
            ) in six <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> the world was<lb/>
made, on the seventh day there was<lb/>
rest; it is beyond this world, therefore<lb/>
that rest is, and it is beyond this world,<lb/>
that the fruit of rest is to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> had. I<lb/>
shall <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> you (observing brevity) the<lb/>
excellency of that rest that is reserved for<lb/>
<normalised orig="Beleevers" auto="true">Believers</normalised> in Heaven.<lb/>
As First, It is a superlative rest, a rest<lb/>
that infinitely exceeds all earthly rest, all<lb/>
other rest is not to be named in the day<lb/>
wherein this rest is spoken of; Some<lb/>
have purchased rest (for a time) with silver<lb/>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
and gold, but this is a rest, that all the<lb/>
gold and silver in the world can never<lb/>
purchase; over this rest is written not<lb/>
the price of gold, but the price of blood,<lb/>
yea the price of the best, and noblest<lb/>
blood that ever run in veins; that rest<lb/>
wee have here, must needs be a poor,<lb/>
low-prized rest (ubi multa cautela custoditur<lb/>
salus corporis, custodita etiam amittitur,<lb/>
amissa <normalised orig="cum" auto="true">come</normalised> gravi <normalised orig="labore" auto="true">labour</normalised> reparatur,<lb/>
&amp; tamen reparata in dubio semper est;)<lb/>
where the health of the body is preserved<lb/>
with much <normalised orig="watchfulnesse" auto="true">watchfulness</normalised>, being preserved,<lb/>
is also lost; being lost, is recovered<lb/>
with much labour; and yet being recovered,<lb/>
is <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> in danger, and <normalised orig="doubtfulnesse" auto="true">doubtfulness</normalised>,<lb/>
what will become of it: our estate<lb/>
in this world is not a fixed estate; what<lb/>
then is our rest? our very living is but a<lb/>
passing away, our lives are full of<lb/>
troubles, and they fill our souls full of<lb/>
<normalised orig="unquietnesse" auto="false">unquietness</normalised>. After the Trojans had<lb/>
been tossing and <normalised orig="wandring" auto="true">wandering</normalised> in the Mediterranean<lb/>
Sea, as soon as they espied Italy,<lb/>
they <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> out with exulting joy;<lb/>
Italy, Italy, And so when Saints after<lb/>
all their tossings and <normalised orig="restlesnesse" auto="false">restlessness</normalised> in this<lb/>
world shall come to Heaven, then (and<lb/>
not till then) they will cry out, rest, rest,<lb/>
no rest to this rest. But<lb/>
Secondly, The rest reserved in Heaven<lb/>
for <normalised orig="Beleevers" auto="true">Believers</normalised>, it is an universal rest,<lb/>
a rest from all sin, and a rest from all sorrow,<lb/>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
a rest from all afflictions, and a rest<lb/>
from all temptations, a rest from all oppression,<lb/>
and a rest from all vexation,<lb/>
a rest from all labour and pains, from<lb/>
all trouble, and travel, from all Aches,<lb/>
Weaknesses, and Diseases; there is no<lb/>
crying out, O my bones! O my back!<lb/>
O my bowels! O my sides! O my head!<lb/>
O my heart! Our rest here is only in<lb/>
part, and imperfect; here wee have rest<lb/>
in one part, and pain in another, quiet<lb/>
in one part, and torment in another;<lb/>
Sometimes when the head is well, the<lb/>
heart is sick; and sometimes when there<lb/>
is peace in the conscience, there is pain<lb/>
in the bones; here many return us hatred<lb/>
for our love, and this hinders our<lb/>
rest; here wee are apt to create cares<lb/>
and fears to our selves, rather than wee<lb/>
will want them, and this hinders our rest;<lb/>
here wee are very apt to give offence,<lb/>
and as apt to take offence, (though none<lb/>
be given) and this hinders our rest;<lb/>
sometimes wee have rest abroad, and<lb/>
none at home; sometimes rest at home,<lb/>
and none abroad; our rest here is imperfect,<lb/>
and <normalised orig="incompleat" auto="true">incomplete</normalised>, but our rest in<lb/>
Heaven shall be most perfect and <normalised orig="compleat" auto="true">complete</normalised>;<lb/>
there the inward and the outward<lb/>
man shall be both at rest, &amp;c. But<lb/>
Thirdly, It is an uninterrupted rest,<lb/>
it is a rest that none can interrupt, here<lb/>
sometimes sin interrupts our rest; sometimes<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="46">45</fw>
                  <pb n="16"/>
                  <lb/>
temptations interrupts our rest;<lb/>
sometimes divine with-drawings interrupts<lb/>
our rest; sometimes the sudden<lb/>
changes and alterations that God makes<lb/>
in our conditions interrupts our rest;<lb/>
sometimes the power, and sometimes the<lb/>
policy, and sometimes the cruelty of<lb/>
wicked men interrupts our rest; sometimes<lb/>
the <normalised orig="crosness" auto="false">crossness</normalised> of friends, sometimes<lb/>
the deceitfulness of friends, sometimes<lb/>
the loss of friends, and sometimes the<lb/>
death of friends interrupts our rest; one<lb/>
thing or another is still interrupting our<lb/>
rest: O but in Heaven! there shall<lb/>
be no sin, no Devil, no sinner, no false<lb/>
friend, there shall <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> nothing, there<lb/>
shall not be the least thing that may interrupt<lb/>
a Saints rest; indeed Heaven<lb/>
could not <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> Heaven, did it admit of any<lb/>
thing that might interrupt a Saints<lb/>
rest. Heaven is above <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr>all</corr>
                  </choice> winds, and<lb/>
weather, storms and tempests, Earthquakes,<lb/>
and heart-quakes; there is only<lb/>
that which is amiable and <normalised orig="desireable" auto="true">desirable</normalised>;<lb/>
there is nothing to cloud a Christians<lb/>
joy, or to interrupt a Christians<lb/>
rest; when once a soul is asleep<lb/>
in the <normalised orig="bosome" auto="true">bosom</normalised> of Abraham, none can<lb/>
awake him, none can molest or disturb<lb/>
him, here is joy without sorrow, <normalised orig="blessednesse" auto="true">blessedness</normalised><lb/>
without misery, health without<lb/>
sickness, light without darkness, abundance<lb/>
without want, beauty without deformity,<lb/>
                  <pb n="17"/>
                  <lb/>
honour without disgrace, ease<lb/>
without labour, and peace without interruption,<lb/>
or perturbation; here shall<lb/>
be eyes without tears, hearts without<lb/>
fears, and souls without sin; here shall<lb/>
be no evil to molest the soul, here shall<lb/>
be all good to cheat the soul, and all happiness<lb/>
to <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised> the soul, and what then<lb/>
can possibly interrupt the rest of the<lb/>
soul? But<lb/>
Fourthly, As it is an uninterrupted rest,<lb/>
so it is a peculiar rest; it is a rest peculiar<lb/>
to Sons, to Saints, to Heirs, to Beloved<lb/>
ones, <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 127.2. <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 127.2">So <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> gives his Beloved<lb/>

or dear beloved, quiet rest, without<lb/>

letter (which is not usual) to denote the<lb/>
more quietness and rest; this rest is a<lb/>
Crown that God sets only upon the head<lb/>
of Saints; it is a gold chain that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> only<lb/>
puts about his <normalised orig="childrens" auto="true">children's</normalised> necks; it is a<lb/>

rest is a tree of life that is proper and peculiar<lb/>

their rest, their quiet, &amp;c. their Heaven,<lb/>

                  <lb/>
whilst the people of God are troubled<lb/>
and disquieted on every side; but the day<lb/>
is a <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> wherein the Saints shall<lb/>
have rest, and sinners shall never have a<lb/>
good day more, never have an hours rest<lb/>
more; their torments shall be <normalised orig="endlesse" auto="true">endless</normalised>,<lb/>
and <normalised orig="easelesse" auto="false">easeless</normalised>. The old world had their<lb/>
resting time, but at last patience and<lb/>

their rest, by (washing and) sweeping<lb/>
them to hell with a flood; And then<lb/>
Noah, and those righteous souls that<lb/>
were with him, had their time of rest and<lb/>
peace; and so shall it be with sinners and<lb/>
Saints at last, &amp;c. But<lb/>
<normalised orig="Fifthly" auto="true">Fiftly</normalised>, The rest reserved for the<lb/>
Saints in Heaven, as it is a peculiar rest;<lb/>
so it is a rest that is universally communicable<lb/>
to all the Sons and Daughters<lb/>
of God; <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Thess 1.7">And to you who are troubled rest<lb/>
with us,</quote> saith the Apostle Paul, rest with<lb/>

Here some Saints are at liberty, when others<lb/>
are in prison; here some sit under<lb/>
their own Vines, and drink the blood<lb/>
of the Grape, whilst others have their<lb/>
blood poured out as water upon the<lb/>
ground, &amp;c. but in Heaven they shall<lb/>
all have rest together, the <normalised orig="beleeving" auto="true">believing</normalised><lb/>
Husband, and the <normalised orig="beleeving" auto="true">believing</normalised> Wife shall<lb/>
rest together, and <normalised orig="beleeving" auto="true">believing</normalised> Parents, and<lb/>
<normalised orig="beleeving" auto="true">believing</normalised> children shall rest together;<lb/>

                  <lb/>
here one relation <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> rest, when the other<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not; but there they shall all rest<lb/>
together; there the painful Preacher,<lb/>
and the diligent hearer shall rest<lb/>
together; there the gracious Master<lb/>
and the pious servant shall rest together,<lb/>
&amp;c. Isa. 57.2. <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 57.2"><normalised orig="Hee" auto="true">He</normalised> shall enter into<lb/>
peace, they shall rest in their beds, each one<lb/>
walking in his uprightness</quote>; they shall rest<lb/>
in their beds, or as some read it; they shall<lb/>
rest in their Bee-hives, expressing the<lb/>
Hebrew by the <normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised>, Cubile, signifies<lb/>
a Bee-hive, as well as a Couch, or<lb/>
Bed; Look as the poor wearied Bees<lb/>
do rest altogether in their Bee-hives, in<lb/>
their <normalised orig="hony-houses" auto="false">honey-houses</normalised>, so all the Saints shall<lb/>
rest together in Heaven, which is their<lb/>
Bee-hive, their <normalised orig="Hony-house" auto="false">Honey-house</normalised>: And O<lb/>
what a happy rest will that be, when all<lb/>
the Saints shall rest together! But<lb/>
Sixthly and lastly, It is a permanent,<lb/>
a constant rest, of this rest there shall be<lb/>
no end; it is a rest that shall last as long<lb/>
as Heaven lasts; yea, as long as God himself<lb/>
shall continue; time shall be no more,<lb/>
and this world shall be no more, but this<lb/>
rest shall remain for ever; the rest of the<lb/>
people of God in this world is transient;<lb/>
it is inconstant; now they have rest, and<lb/>
anon they have none; now a calm, presently<lb/>
a storm; now all is in quiet, anon<lb/>
all is in an uproar; their rest in this world,<lb/>
is like a morning cloud, and the early<lb/>

                  <lb/>
dew, which is soon <normalised orig="dryed" auto="true">dried</normalised> up by the<lb/>
beams of the Sun. Since God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> cast<lb/>
man out of Paradise, out of his first rest,<lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> can <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> but little rest in this world;<lb/>
sometimes the unfitness of the creature<lb/>
troubles him, sometimes the fickleness<lb/>
of the creature vexes him, sometimes<lb/>
the treachery of the creature <normalised orig="inrages" auto="true">enrages</normalised><lb/>
him, and sometimes the want of the creature<lb/>
distracts him; when in his heart <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised><lb/>
saith, now I shall have rest, now I shall<lb/>
be quiet, then troubles and changes<lb/>
comes; so that his whole life is rather<lb/>
a dreaming of rest, than an <normalised orig="injoying" auto="true">enjoying</normalised> of<lb/>
rest: O! but in Heaven the rest of the<lb/>
Saints shall have no end; there shall be<lb/>
nothing that can put a period to their<lb/>
rest; there shall be every thing that may<lb/>
conduce to the perpetuating of their<lb/>
rest, Heaven would be but a poor low<lb/>
thing, did it not afford a perpetual<lb/>
rest.<lb/>
Thirdly, As the best rest, so the best<lb/>
sight and knowledge of God is reserved<lb/>
for <normalised orig="Beleevers" auto="true">Believers</normalised>, till they come to Heaven:<lb/>
I readily grant, that even in this world<lb/>
the Saints do know the Lord, inwardly,<lb/>
spiritually, powerfully, feelingly, experimentally,<lb/>
transformingly, practically;<lb/>
but yet notwithstanding all this, the<lb/>
best knowledge of God is reserved for<lb/>
Heaven, which I shall evidence by an induction<lb/>
of particulars thus.<lb/>

                  <lb/>
First, They shall have the clearest<lb/>
knowledge and revelation of God in<lb/>
Heaven; here our visions of God are not<lb/>
clear, and this makes many a child of<lb/>
light to sit, and sigh in <normalised orig="darknesse" auto="true">darkness</normalised>. God<lb/>
<normalised orig="vails" auto="true">veils</normalised> himself, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> covers himself with a<lb/>
cloud, man when <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> is silent concerning<lb/>
God, <normalised orig="seemeth" auto="true">seems</normalised> to be something, but when<lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> begins to speak of God, it plainly<lb/>
appears that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> is nothing.<lb/>
Simonides being asked by Hiero the<lb/>
Tyrant, what God was; craved a day for<lb/>
to deliberate about an answer, but the<lb/>
more <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> sought into the nature of God,<lb/>
the more difficult <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> found it to express;<lb/>
therefore the next day after being questioned,<lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> asked two <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised>; the third<lb/>
day <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> craved four, and so from that<lb/>
time forth doubled the number, and being<lb/>
asked why <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> did so, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> answered,<lb/>
that the more <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> studied, the less he was<lb/>
able to define, what <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was; so incomprehensible<lb/>
is his nature.<lb/>
Our visions of God here are dark and<lb/>
obscure; Augustin asking the question<lb/>
what God is? gives in this answer (certe<lb/>
hic est, de quo &amp; quum dicitur non potest<lb/>
dici, quum æstimatur, non potest æstimari,<lb/>
quum comparatur, non potest comparari,<lb/>
quum definitur, ipse sua definitione crescit)<lb/>
Surely it is <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised>, who when <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> is spoken<lb/>
of, cannot be spoken of; who when <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised><lb/>
is considered of, cannot be considered<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="52">E2</fw>
                  <pb n="22"/>
                  <lb/>
of; who when <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> is compared to any<lb/>
thing, cannot be compared, and when<lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> is defined, <normalised orig="groweth" auto="true">grows</normalised> greater by defining<lb/>
of him. It is observable, that it<lb/>
was not the Lord which the Prophet<lb/>
Ezekiel saw, it was only a vision; in the<lb/>
vision it was not the glory of the Lord<lb/>
which <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> saw, but the likeness of it;<lb/>
nay, it was not the likeness of it, but the<lb/>
appearance of the <normalised orig="likenesse" auto="true">likeness</normalised> of the glory<lb/>
of the Lord that made him to fall on his<lb/>
face, as not being able to behold it;<lb/>
Sin <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> so weakened, <normalised orig="dazled" auto="true">dazzled</normalised>, and <normalised orig="darkned" auto="true">darkened</normalised><lb/>
the eye of our souls, that wee cannot<lb/>
bear the sight of the glory of the<lb/>
Lord, nor the likeness of it, no nor the<lb/>
appearance of the <normalised orig="likenesse" auto="true">likeness</normalised> of it.<lb/>
In the Psalms the Lord is said to ride<lb/>
upon a Cherub, upon which words one<lb/>
saith thus (Cherub <normalised orig="quippe" auto="true">quip</normalised> plenitudo scientiæ<lb/>
dicitur, proinde super plenitudinem,<lb/>
scientiæ ascendisse perhibetur, quia majestatis<lb/>
ejus plenitudinem scientiæ nulla comprehendit)<lb/>
a Cherub is so called as being a<lb/>
<normalised orig="fulness" auto="true">fullness</normalised> of knowledge; and therefore is<lb/>
God said to ascend above the <normalised orig="fulnesse" auto="true">fullness</normalised> of<lb/>
knowledge, because no knowledge <normalised orig="comprehendeth" auto="true">comprehends</normalised><lb/>
the <normalised orig="fulness" auto="true">fullness</normalised> of his Majesty.<lb/>
