ALthough the Christian Religion <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised><lb/>
lay the greatest obligations on<lb/>
mankind to Peace and Unity, by<lb/>
the strictest commands, the<lb/>
highest examples, and the most<lb/>
prevailing arguments; yet so<lb/>
much have the passions and interests of men<lb/>
<normalised orig="overswai'd" auto="false">overswayed</normalised> the sense of their duty, that as nothing<lb/>
ought to be more in our wishes, so nothing<lb/>
seems more remote from our hopes, than the universal<lb/>
Peace of the Christian World. Not that<lb/>
there is any impossibility in the thing, or any considerable<lb/>
difficulty, if all men were such Christians<lb/>
as they ought to be; but as long as men<lb/>
pursue their several factions and designs under<lb/>
the colour and pretence of zeal for Religion; if<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="2">B</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
they did not find Names and Parties ready framed,<lb/>
that were suitable to their ends, the difference<lb/>
of their designs would make them. So<lb/>
that till <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> corruptions are mortified, and<lb/>
their passions subdued to a greater degree than<lb/>
the world <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> yet found them, it is in vain to<lb/>
expect a state of peace and tranquillity in the<lb/>
Church. We need not go far from home for a<lb/>
sufficient evidence of this; for although our differences<lb/>
are such as the wiser Protestants abroad<lb/>
not only condemn but wonder at them; yet it<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> hitherto puzzled the wisest persons among<lb/>
us to find out <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> to compose them; not so<lb/>
much from the distance of <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> opinions and<lb/>
practices, as the strength of their prejudices and<lb/>
inclinations. What those divisions of Reuben of<lb/>
old were, which caused such thoughts and searchings<lb/>
of heart, we neither well understand, nor<lb/>
<normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> it much concern us: but the continuance,<lb/>
if not the widening, of these unhappy breaches<lb/>
among our selves do give such cause for many<lb/>
sad reflections. When neither the miseries we<lb/>
have felt, nor the calamities we fear; neither the<lb/>
terrible judgements of God upon us, nor the unexpected<lb/>
deliverances vouchsafed to us, nor the<lb/>
common danger we are yet in, have abated <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised><lb/>
heats, or allayed their passions, or made them<lb/>
more willing to unite with our established<lb/>
Church and Religion. But instead of that, some<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="3">2</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
rather stand at a greater distance if not defiance,<lb/>
and seem to entertain themselves with hopes of<lb/>
new revolutions; others raise fresh calumnies<lb/>
and reproaches; as well as revive and spread<lb/>
abroad old ones; as though their business were<lb/>
to make our breaches wider, and to exasperate<lb/>
<normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> spirits against each other; at such a time,<lb/>
when Reason and common security, and above<lb/>
all our Religion <normalised orig="obligeth" auto="true">obliges</normalised> us to <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 14.19">follow after the<lb/>
things that make for peace, and things wherewith one<lb/>
may <normalised orig="edifie" auto="true">edify</normalised> another;</quote> and not, such as tend to our<lb/>
mutual destruction; as most certainly our divisions<lb/>
and animosities do. Yet all parties pretend<lb/>
to a zeal for Peace, so they may have it in their<lb/>
own way: by which it appears that it is not<lb/>
Peace they aim at but Victory; nor Unity so<lb/>
much as having their own wills. Those of the<lb/>
Roman Church make great boasts of their Unity<lb/>
and the effectual means they have to preserve it;<lb/>
but God deliver us from such cruel <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> of<lb/>
Peace, and such destructive means of Unity as<lb/>
Treachery and Assassinations, and an Inquisition.<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 3.15-17">Their feet are swift to shed blood; destruction and misery<lb/>
are in their <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised>; and the way of Peace they have<lb/>
not known.</quote> But it were happy for us, if all those<lb/>
who agree in renouncing the Errors and Corruptions<lb/>
of the Roman Church, could as easily<lb/>
join together in the great duties of our common<lb/>
Religion, that is, in our Prayers, and Praises,<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="4">B2</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
and Sacraments, and all solemn acts of Divine<lb/>
Worship. For this would not only take off the<lb/>
reproach of our Adversaries, who continually<lb/>
upbraid us with our Schisms and Separations,<lb/>
but it would mightily tend to abate <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> passions,<lb/>
and to remove their prejudices, and to dispose<lb/>
their inclinations, and thereby lay a foundation<lb/>
for a blessed Union among our selves.<lb/>
Which would frustrate the great design of our<lb/>
enemies upon us, who expect to see that Religion<lb/>
destroyed by our own folly, which they<lb/>
could not otherwise hope to accomplish by their<lb/>
utmost care and endeavour. And we may justly<lb/>
hope for a greater blessing of God upon us,<lb/>
when we offer up our joint Prayers and Devotions<lb/>
to him, <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Tim 2.8">lifting up</quote>, as St. Paul speaks, <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Tim 2.8">holy hands<lb/>
without wrath and disputing.</quote> This is therefore a<lb/>
thing of so great consequence to our Peace and<lb/>
Union, that tends so much to the Honour of<lb/>
God, and our common Safety and Preservation;<lb/>
that no person who <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> any real concernment<lb/>
for these things, can deny it to be<lb/>
not only just and fitting, but in our circumstances<lb/>
necessary to be done, if it can be made<lb/>
appear to be lawful, or that they can do it with a<lb/>
good Conscience.<lb/>
And this is the subject I design to speak to at<lb/>
this time; and for that purpose have made <normalised orig="choise" auto="true">choice</normalised><lb/>
of these words of the Apostle, <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 3.16">Nevertheless, whereto<lb/>
                     <pb n="4"/>
                     <lb/>
we have already attained, let us walk by the same<lb/>
rule, let us mind the same things.</quote>
                  <lb/>
For our better understanding the full scope and<lb/>
meaning of the Apostle in these words, we are<lb/>
to consider, that an unhappy Schism, or wilful<lb/>
breach of the Churches Unity, had begun in the<lb/>
Apostles times, upon the difference that arose<lb/>
concerning the necessity of keeping the Law of<lb/>
Moses. And that which made the Schism the more<lb/>
dangerous, was that the first beginners of it<lb/>
pretended a Commission from the Apostles<lb/>
themselves at Jerusalem, and were <normalised orig="extreamly" auto="true">extremely</normalised> <normalised orig="busie" auto="true">busy</normalised><lb/>
and industrious to gain and keep up a party<lb/>
to themselves in the most flourishing Churches<lb/>
planted by the Apostles. At Antioch they bore so<lb/>
great a sway, that St. Peter himself complied<lb/>
with them, and not only other Jews, <quote type="biblical" ana="Gal 2.13">but Barnabas<lb/>
also was carried away with their dissimulation.</quote> <normalised orig="Insomuch" auto="true">Inasmuch</normalised><lb/>
that had it not been for the courage and<lb/>
resolution of St. Paul, all the Gentile Christians<lb/>
had been either forced to a compliance with the<lb/>
Jews, or to a perpetual Schism, (of which<lb/>
St. Peter had been in probability the Head, and<lb/>
not of the Churches Unity if St. Paul had not vigorously<lb/>
opposed so dangerous a compliance) But<lb/>
finding so good success in his endeavours at Antioch,<lb/>
he pursues those false Apostles, who made<lb/>
it their business to divide and separate the Christians<lb/>
from each others Communion through all<lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
the Churches, where they had, or were like to<lb/>
make any great impression. He writes his Epistle<lb/>
to the Galatians purposely against them; he warns<lb/>
the Christians at Rome of them. <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 16.17">Now I beseech you<lb/>
Brethren mark them which cause Divisions and Offences<lb/>
contrary to the Doctrine which you have learned, and<lb/>
avoid them.</quote> And because he had understood they<lb/>
had been <normalised orig="busie" auto="true">busy</normalised> at Philippi to make a party there<lb/>
too, therefore the Apostle to prevent their designs,<lb/>
makes use of this following method.<lb/>
1. He exhorts the Philippians to an unanimous<lb/>
and constant resolution, in holding fast to the<lb/>
faith of the Gospel, in <normalised orig="spight" auto="true">spite</normalised> of all the threats<lb/>
and malice of their enemies: <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 1.27-28">That <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> stand fast<lb/>
in one spirit, with one mind, striving together for the<lb/>
faith of the Gospel; and in nothing terrified by your adversaries.</quote>
                  <lb/>
If once the fears of troubles and persecutions<lb/>
make men afraid to own and maintain their<lb/>
Religion; it will be an <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> matter for their<lb/>
enemies first to divide, and then to subdue them.<lb/>
But their courage and unanimity in a good<lb/>
Cause baffles the attempts of the most daring Adversaries,<lb/>
and makes them willing to retreat<lb/>
when they see they can neither disunite them nor<lb/>
make them afraid.<lb/>
2. He beseeches them in the most vehement<lb/>
and affectionate manner, not to give<lb/>
way to any differences or divisions among them,<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 2.1-2">If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any<lb/>
                     <pb n="6"/>
                     <lb/>
comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit, if any<lb/>
bowels and mercies; fulfil <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> my joy, that <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> be like<lb/>
minded, having the same love; being of one accord, of<lb/>
one mind.</quote> As though he had said unto them, I have<lb/>
seen the miserable effects of divisions in other<lb/>
Churches already, how our Religion <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been<lb/>
reproached, the Gospel <normalised orig="hindred" auto="true">hindered</normalised>, and the Cross<lb/>
of Christ <normalised orig="rendred" auto="true">rendered</normalised> of little or no effect by reason<lb/>
of them; let me therefore <normalised orig="intreat" auto="true">entreat</normalised> you, if you<lb/>
have any regard to the Peace and Welfare of<lb/>
your own souls; if you have any sense of your<lb/>
duty you owe to one another as members of the<lb/>
same body; if you have any tenderness or pity<lb/>
towards me, avoid the first tendencies to any<lb/>
breaches among you; entertain no unjust suspicions<lb/>
or jealousies of each other, <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> all the<lb/>
kindness you are able to your fellow members;<lb/>
live as those that are acted by the same soul<lb/>
(NoValue) carry on the same design; and as much<lb/>
as possible prevent any differences in opinions<lb/>
amongst you.<lb/>
3. He warns them and gives cautions against<lb/>
some persons from whom their greatest danger<lb/>
was, viz. such as pretended a mighty zeal for<lb/>
the Law: And very well understanding the mischief<lb/>
of their designs under their specious pretences,<lb/>
he bestows very severe characters upon<lb/>
them, <normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>. 2. <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 3.2">Beware of Dogs, beware of evil workers,<lb/>
beware of the Concision.</quote> All which Characters<lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
relate to the breaches and divisions which they<lb/>
made in the Christian Churches; which like<lb/>
Dogs they did tear in pieces, and thereby did unspeakable<lb/>
mischief, and so were evil workers, and<lb/>
by the Concision St. Chrysostom understands such a<lb/>
cutting in pieces as tends to the destruction of a<lb/>
thing; and therefore, saith he, the Apostle called<lb/>
them NoValue: because<lb/>
they endeavoured to cut in pieces, and<lb/>
thereby to destroy the Church of God. But lest<lb/>
they should give out that St. Paul spoke this out<lb/>
of a particular pique he had taken up against<lb/>
the Law of Moses, he declares that as to the spiritual<lb/>
intention and design of the Law it was accomplished<lb/>
in Christians, <normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>. 3. <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 3.3">For we are the<lb/>
Circumcision which worship God in the spirit, and <normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised><lb/>
in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</quote>
                  <lb/>
And for his own part, he had as much reason<lb/>
to glory in legal <normalised orig="priviledges" auto="true">privileges</normalised> as any of them all,<lb/>
<normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>. 4, 5, 6. but the excellency of the Gospel<lb/>
of Christ had so prevailed upon his mind, that<lb/>
he now despised the things he valued before,<lb/>
and made it his whole business to attain<lb/>
to the glorious reward which this Religion <normalised orig="promiseth" auto="true">promises</normalised>.<lb/>
This he pursues from <normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>. 7, to<lb/>
<normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>. 15.<lb/>
4. Having done this, he <normalised orig="perswades" auto="true">persuades</normalised> all<lb/>
good Christians to do as he did, <normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>. 15. <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 3.15">Let us<lb/>
therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded.</quote> But<lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
because many disputes and differences as to opinion<lb/>
and practice might happen among them, he<lb/>
therefore lays down two Rules for them to govern<lb/>
themselves by.<lb/>
1. If any <normalised orig="happen'd" auto="true">happened</normalised> to differ from the body of<lb/>
Christians they lived with, they should do it with<lb/>
great Modesty and Humility, not breaking out<lb/>
into factions and divisions, but waiting for farther<lb/>
information, which they may expect that God<lb/>
will give upon a diligent and sober use of the best<lb/>
means; <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 3.15">And if in any thing <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> be otherwise minded, God<lb/>
shall reveal even this unto you.</quote> By leaving them to<lb/>
Gods immediate care for farther illumination, he<lb/>
<normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not bid them depend upon extraordinary revelation;<lb/>
but requires them to wait upon God in<lb/>
his own way, without proceeding with the false<lb/>
Apostles to the <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> of Faction and Separation,<lb/>
and in the mean time to go as far as they could.<lb/>
2. For those who were come to a firmness and<lb/>
settlement of judgement upon the Christian principles,<lb/>
he charges them by all means to preserve<lb/>
Unity and Peace among themselves. <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 3.16">Whereto we<lb/>
have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let<lb/>
us mind the same things.</quote>
                  <lb/>
Wherein the Apostle supposes two things.<lb/>
I. The necessity of one fixed and certain<lb/>
Rule, notwithstanding the different attainments<lb/>
among Christians. <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 3.16">Nevertheless, whereto we have<lb/>
already attained, let us walk by the same Rule.</quote>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="10">C</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
II. The duty and obligation which lies upon<lb/>
the best Christians to observe it. He <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not<lb/>
speak to the ignorant and unthinking multitude;<lb/>
not to the licentious rabble, nor to the carnal and<lb/>
worldly Church; which some think are only desirous<lb/>
of Uniformity; but to the very best Christians;<lb/>
to those who had got the start of others<lb/>
(as the words here <normalised orig="signifie" auto="true">signify</normalised>) that they would be<lb/>
an example of Peace and Unity to their Brethren.<lb/>
I. The necessity of one fixed and certain Rule,<lb/>
notwithstanding the different attainments, of Christians.<lb/>
                  NoValue which Phrase seems to<lb/>
be a continuation of the former allusion to a Race.<lb/>
For as Eustathius observes, the first thing the Greeks<lb/>
were wont to do as to their exercises, was to circumscribe<lb/>
the bounds within which they were to<lb/>
be performed. That which fixed and determined<lb/>
these limits was called NoValue by the Greeks, and<lb/>
                  Regula and Lineæ by the Latins: thence transilire<lb/>
lineas in Cicero is to commit a fault, to break<lb/>
the bounds within which we are confined.<lb/>
All the question is, what the Apostle means by<lb/>
this Rule, whether only a Rule of Charity and<lb/>
mutual forbearance, with a liberty of different<lb/>
practice; or such a Rule which limits and <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>dermines</sic>
                     <corr>determines</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
the manner of practice. It cannot be the former,<lb/>
because that is the case, the Apostle had spoken to<lb/>
just before. <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 3.15">If in any thing <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> be otherwise minded;</quote>
                  <lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
therefore now subjoining this with respect to those<lb/>
who had gone beyond them, he <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> imply such<lb/>
an agreement and uniformity of Practice as <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised><lb/>
lie in observing the same standing Rule. For<lb/>
which we must consider, that they understood already<lb/>
what orders and directions he had given<lb/>
them when a Church was first formed among<lb/>
them; and therefore when the Apostle mentions<lb/>
a Rule without declaring what it was, we have<lb/>
reason to believe, it was such a Rule which they<lb/>
very well knew, which he had given to them before.<lb/>
So we find elsewhere the Apostle refers to<lb/>
such Rules of Government and Order, which he<lb/>
had given to other Churches, and were already<lb/>
received and practised among them. For the<lb/>
Apostles did not write their Epistles for the founding<lb/>
of Churches, but they were already in being;<lb/>
only they took notice of any disorders among<lb/>
them, and reformed abuses, and left some things<lb/>
to their own directions, when they should come<lb/>
among them. <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 11.34">And the rest will I set in order when<lb/>
I come.</quote>
                  <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 7.17">As the Lord <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> called every one, so let him<lb/>
walk; and so ordain I in all the Churches.</quote> Which<lb/>
<normalised orig="shews" auto="true">shows</normalised> that the Apostles did not leave all persons<lb/>
to act as they judged fit, but did make Rules determining<lb/>
their practice, and obliging them to<lb/>
uniformity therein. For might not men pretend<lb/>
that these were not things in themselves necessary,<lb/>
and might be scrupled by some Persons, and<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="12">C2</fw>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
therefore were not fit to be imposed upon any?<lb/>
But I do not find that the Apostles on this account<lb/>
did forbear giving Rules in such cases, and to oblige<lb/>
Christians to observe them; and that not on<lb/>
the <normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> Authority of Apostles, but as <normalised orig="Governours" auto="true">Governors</normalised><lb/>
of Churches, whose business it is to take<lb/>
care of the welfare and preservation of them.<lb/>
There are many things which seem very little<lb/>
and inconsiderable in themselves, whose consequence<lb/>
and tendency is very great; and the wisdom<lb/>
of <normalised orig="Governours" auto="true">Governors</normalised> lies in preventing the danger<lb/>
of little things, and keeping the zeal of well-meaning<lb/>
persons within its due bounds. For,<lb/>
those who are engaged below in the Valley, fighting<lb/>
in small parties, and pursuing their advantages,<lb/>
do run into their enemies Camp before<lb/>
they are aware of it, may receive an unexpected<lb/>
check from their Commanders in chief, who from<lb/>
the higher ground <normalised orig="espie" auto="true">espy</normalised> the hazard they are in by<lb/>
their over-forwardness, and the arts which their enemies<lb/>
use in drawing them into little Companies<lb/>
to fight separately, and the danger they may thereby<lb/>
bring upon the whole Army; and therefore send<lb/>
them a peremptory order to give over fighting by<lb/>
themselves and make good their retreat into the<lb/>
Body of the Army: They wonder, they complain,<lb/>
they think themselves hardly used; but no understanding<lb/>
man blames their Generals who regard<lb/>
their safety more than they do themselves,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="13">12</fw>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
and know the allowing them he Liberty they desire,<lb/>
would endanger the destruction of them all.<lb/>
The Wisdom and Conduct of <normalised orig="Governours" auto="true">Governors</normalised>, is quite<lb/>
another thing from the Zeal and Courage of <normalised orig="inferiour" auto="true">inferior</normalised><lb/>
Persons; who knowing their own resolution<lb/>
and integrity, think much to be controlled; but<lb/>
those who stand upon higher Ground and see<lb/>
further than they can do, must be allowed a better<lb/>
capacity of judging what makes for the safety<lb/>
of the whole, than they can have: and such things<lb/>
which they look on in themselves, and therefore<lb/>
think them mean and trifling, the other look<lb/>
upon them in their consequence, and the influence<lb/>
they may have upon the <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> safety. It were<lb/>
<normalised orig="extreamly" auto="true">extremely</normalised> desirable that all good and useful men<lb/>
should enjoy as much satisfaction as might be, but if<lb/>
it cannot be attained without running great hazards<lb/>
of unsettling all, it is then to be considered,<lb/>
whether the general safety or some <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> particular<lb/>
satisfaction be the more desirable. And<lb/>
this is that, which the example of the Apostles<lb/>
themselves gives us reason to consider, for although<lb/>
there were many doubts and scruples in<lb/>
their times about several Rites and <normalised orig="Customes" auto="true">Customs</normalised>,<lb/>
yet the Apostles did give Rules in such cases, and<lb/>
bind Christians to observe them; as we find in<lb/>
that famous decree made upon great deliberation,<lb/>
in a Council of the Apostles at Jerusalem;<lb/>
wherein they determined those things which they<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="14">13</fw>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
knew were then scrupled, and continued so to<lb/>
be afterwards, <normalised orig="whereever" auto="true">wherever</normalised> the Judaizing Christians<lb/>
prevailed. But notwithstanding all their dissatisfaction,<lb/>
the Apostles continued the same<lb/>
Rule; And S. Paul here requires the most forward<lb/>
Christians to mind their Rule, and to preserve<lb/>
Peace and Unity among themselves.<lb/>
But <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not S. Paul in the 14th Chapter of his Epistle<lb/>
to the Romans lay down quite another Rule, viz. only<lb/>
of mutual forbearance in such cases, where men are unsatisfied<lb/>
in conscience?<lb/>
I answer, that the Apostle did act like a prudent<lb/>
<normalised orig="Governour" auto="true">Governor</normalised>, and in such a manner, as he<lb/>
thought, did most tend to the propagation of the<lb/>
Gospel, and the good of particular Churches. In<lb/>
some Churches that consisted most of Jews, as<lb/>
the Church of Rome at this time did, and where<lb/>
they did not impose the necessity of keeping the<lb/>
Law on the Gentile Christians (as we do not find<lb/>
they did at Rome) the Apostle was willing to have<lb/>
the Law buried as decently, and with as little<lb/>
noise as might be; and therefore in this case, he<lb/>
<normalised orig="perswades" auto="true">persuades</normalised> both parties to Forbearance and Charity,<lb/>
in avoiding the judging and censuring one another,<lb/>
since they had an equal regard to the honour<lb/>
of God in what they did. But in those Churches,<lb/>
where the false Apostles made use of this pretence,<lb/>
of the Levitical Law being still in force, to divide<lb/>
the Churches, and to separate the Communion<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="15">14</fw>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
of Christians; there the Apostle bids them<lb/>
beware of them, and their practices; as being of<lb/>
a dangerous and pernicious consequence. So<lb/>
that the preserving the Peace of the Church, and<lb/>
preventing Separation was the great measure,<lb/>
according to which, the Apostle gave his directions;<lb/>
and that makes him so much insist on this<lb/>
advice to the Philippians, that whatever their attainments<lb/>
in Christianity were, they should <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 3.16">walk<lb/>
by the same Rule, and mind the same things.</quote>
                  <lb/>
II. We take notice of the Duty and obligation<lb/>
that lies upon the best Christians, <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 3.16">to walk by the same<lb/>
Rule, to mind the same things.</quote>
                  <lb/>
From whence arise two very considerable Enquiries.<lb/>
1. How far the obligation <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> extend to comply<lb/>
with an established Rule, and to preserve the<lb/>
Peace of the Church we live in?<lb/>
2. What is to be done, if men cannot come<lb/>
up to that Rule? For the Apostle speaks only<lb/>
of such as have attained so far; <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 3.16">Whereto we have<lb/>
already attained, let us walk by the same Rule.</quote>
                  <lb/>
1. How far the obligation <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> extend to<lb/>
comply with an established Rule, and to preserve<lb/>
the Peace of the Church we live in? This<lb/>
I think the more necessary to be spoken to, because<lb/>
I cannot <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> my self that so many<lb/>
scrupulous and conscientious men as are at this<lb/>
day among us would live so many years in<lb/>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
a known sin; i.e. in a state of Separation<lb/>
from the Communion of a Church, which in<lb/>
Conscience they thought themselves obliged to<lb/>
communicate with. It must be certainly some<lb/>
great mistake in their judgements must lead them<lb/>
to this; (for I am by no means willing to impute it<lb/>
to passion and evil designs) and out of the hearty<lb/>
desire I have, if possible, to give satisfaction in this<lb/>
matter, I shall endeavour to search to the bottom of<lb/>
this dangerous mistake, to which we owe so much<lb/>
of our present distractions and fears.<lb/>
But for the better preventing all mis-understanding<lb/>
the design of my Discourse, I desire it<lb/>
may be considered<lb/>
1. That I speak not of the Separation or distinct<lb/>
Communion of whole Churches from each other;<lb/>
which according to the Scripture, Antiquity and<lb/>
Reason, have a just Right and Power to Govern<lb/>
and Reform themselves. By whole Churches, I<lb/>
mean, the Churches of such Nations, which upon<lb/>
the decay of the Roman Empire, resumed<lb/>
their just Right of Government to themselves,<lb/>
and upon their owning Christianity, incorporated<lb/>
into one Christian Society, under the same<lb/>
common ties and Rules of Order and Government.<lb/>
Such as the Church of Macedonia would have<lb/>
been, if from being a Roman Province it had become<lb/>
a Christian Kingdom, and the Churches of<lb/>
Thessalonica, Philippi and the rest had united together,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="17">16</fw>
                  <pb n="16"/>
                  <lb/>
And so the several Churches of he Lydians or Proconsular<lb/>
Asia, if they had been united in one Kingdom,<lb/>
and Governed by the same Authority, under<lb/>
the same Rules, might have been truly called<lb/>
the Lydian Church. Just as several Families uniting<lb/>
make one Kingdom, which at first had a<lb/>
distinct and independent Power, but it would<lb/>
make strange confusion in the world to reduce<lb/>
Kingdoms back again to Families, because at first<lb/>
they were made up of them. Thus National<lb/>
Churches are National Societies of Christians,<lb/>
under the same Laws of Government and rules of<lb/>
Worship. For the true notion of a Church is no<lb/>
more than of a Society of men united together for<lb/>
their Order and Government according to the<lb/>
Rules of the Christian Religion. And it is a great<lb/>
mistake, to make the notion of a Church barely to<lb/>
relate to Acts of Worship; and consequently that<lb/>
the adequate notion of a Church, is an Assembly<lb/>
for Divine Worship; by which means they appropriate<lb/>
the name of Churches to particular<lb/>
Congregations. Whereas, if this held true, the<lb/>
Church must be dissolved <normalised orig="assoon" auto="true">as soon</normalised> as the Congregation<lb/>
is broken up; but if they retain the nature of a<lb/>
Church, when they do not meet together for<lb/>
Worship, then there is some other bond that unites<lb/>
them; and whatever that is; it constitutes the<lb/>
Church.<lb/>
