already dealt with:
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}pb – gets ignored as this is probably(?) just relevant for the original document, not the final corpus
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}lb – its tail is always the actual linebreak and gets added by the script
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}p – marks beginning text, so far used to add a little formatting to the test export
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}hi – content gets added to export text
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}head – titles. Some formatting is done for test exports
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}notvariant – content gets added to export text
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}normalised – that's the VARD element and its content, which is the normalised version, gets added to export text
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}div – a document marker. Gets ignored, which has no discernable impact on the text. Likely not relevant for final corpus
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}fw – for page numbering and the like. To my understanding completely irrelevant for final corpus, hence gets skipped
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}join – its content, which is the normalised version, gets added to export text
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}corr – itself gets skipped, but contents processed normally – see <sic> element for further info
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}closer – represents signature formulations etc, gets added
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}opener – represents introductions etc, got added to normal processing and is seemingly handled fine
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}foreign – only present once in corpus for a word that was omitted. Ignoring is therefore fine for this corpus
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}variant – seems to be a non-normalized, but recognized, variant. Just once in corpus. Added to the normal processing and it works fine.
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}sp – found in the catechism section a lot. Functions similarly to <p>
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}l – found in the catechism section a lot. Seems to be a line, so no </lb> elements are used there.
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}note – almost exclusively used in TEI header; two exceptions are one for an illegible word (possible element mis-use) and a series of bible references in one text. The latter I could export with the referenced bible passages. Normal processing simply yields the text fine
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}unclear – used only once for something illegible. Skipping it actually yields a clearer output (ascends and on the right of God, instead of ascends and steeth on the right of God – they normalized sitteth (or so) into teeth)
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}quote – was already included in first version of script. Seems to be handled fine based on one example
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}writing – only one instance in corpus. Including it worked perfectly
<cyfunction Comment at 0x103854a00> – indicates presence of an XML comment (<!-- … -->)
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}body – in test file it was the only child element of the <text> element, which is in turn the one marking the actual content of a TEI doc. Make sure this is true for ALL docs in corpus – checked and yes it is
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}choice – itself gets skipped, but content gets handled – make sure its contents are the same in ALL docs as they were in the test doc – it's an uncomplicated case as only its <sic> gets skipped which is fine. Contents of corr, even if they contain further elements, should be handled fine.


2 small XML-issues were fixed to restore well-formedness
3 instances of a normalised-element (manual) not containing the actual normalisation were fixed by supplying the normalisation myself
15 instances of the same with apparently automatically-normalised elements that lacked a normalisation
