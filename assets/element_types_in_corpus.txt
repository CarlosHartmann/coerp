already dealt with:
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}pb – gets ignored as this is probably(?) just relevant for the original document, not the final corpus
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}lb – its tail is always the actual linebreak and gets added by the script
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}p – marks beginning text, so far used to add a little formatting to the test export
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}hi – content gets added to export text
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}head – titles. Some formatting is done for test exports
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}notvariant – content gets added to export text
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}normalised – that's the VARD element and its content, which is the normalised version, gets added to export text
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}div – a document marker. Gets ignored, which has no discernable impact on the text. Likely not relevant for final corpus
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}fw – for page numbering and the like. To my understanding completely irrelevant for final corpus, hence gets skipped
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}join – its content, which is the normalised version, gets added to export text
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}corr – itself gets skipped, but contents processed normally – see <sic> element for further info
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}closer – represents signature formulations etc, gets added


still to be investigated:

further analysis potentially useful:
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}body – in test file it was the only child element of the <text> element, which is in turn the one marking the actual content of a TEI doc. Make sure this is true for ALL docs in corpus
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}choice – itself gets skipped, but content gets handled – make sure its contents are the same in ALL docs as they were in the test doc
{http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0}sic – gets skipped as it always shows up with following <corr> element – make sure this is true for all of them in ALL docs, including if <corr> always contains something normalised or if it can contain only text, and if that text gets added by script
