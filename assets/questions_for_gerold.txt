1 – What to do with TEI Header in export?
2 – How to mark titles and how to handle titles with linebreaks in them
3 – <yt> for 'that' apparently not caught by VARD
4 – The files 'bio_1612_Paule_R3', 'pamphlet_letter_1667_Owen_R2', 'pamphlet_letter_1688_Gee_R2', and 'preface_sermon_1641_Grantham_R2' are duds; they have no proper content apart from a TEI header with little information. Any reason / case of missing or lost data?
