BGSU1001  BGSU1001:0001.1:1  icle_bgsu1001  0  405  It is time, that our society is dominated by industrialization. The prosperity of a country is based on its enormous industrial corporations that are gradually replacing men with machines. Science is highly developed and controls the economy. From the beginning of school life students are expected to master a huge amount of scientific data. Technology is part of our everyday life.
BGSU1001  BGSU1001:0001.1:2  icle_bgsu1001  405  218  Children nowadays prefer to play with computers rather than with our parents' wooden toys. But I think that in our modern world which worships science and technology there is still a place for dreams and imagination.
BGSU1001  BGSU1001:0001.1:3  icle_bgsu1001  623  189  There has always been a place for them in man's life. Even in the darkness of the Middle Ages when religion confined the human mind in the cage of its dogmas, men dreamt of a better life.
BGSU1001  BGSU1001:0001.1:4  icle_bgsu1001  812  382  They dreamt of exploring the unknown depths of earth and sea, of flying into the sky and reaching the stars. Step by step society has freed itself from the restrictions of religion and science has become the dominant power. Nowadays some people see in its dominance a threat to man's inclination to dreaming. But man could dream in the darkest past, so why could he not dream now?
BGSU1001  BGSU1001:0001.1:5  icle_bgsu1001  1194  550  Man has always dreamt of going beyond the world he knew. Science has made the unknown world too small but man keeps on dreaming. He turns to books to find his new inspiration. People nowadays read not less than they did in the past. Besides they still create literature which means they are still capable of creating new imaginary worlds. People still use their imagination to paint pictures and to compose music. Art is still alive. And society feels necessity for this art because people enjoy escaping to other worlds, even if they are not real.
BGSU1001  BGSU1001:0001.1:6  icle_bgsu1001  1744  581  Moreover, I cannot imagine that people have lost their ability of creative thinking. People have always had the gift of imagination. I cannot agree with the statement that because of the dominance of science and technology, there is no place for this gift. How would all the technological achievements and scientific breakthroughs been made, if man had not used his imagination? It is because of his imagination and his constant dreaming that man has achieved so much in science. The fact that science never stops developing is a proof that man never stops using his imagination.
BGSU1001  BGSU1001:0001.1:7  icle_bgsu1001  2325  581  I am sure that man keeps on dreaming. There is not much space left to be explored but in every field of human life there will always be some kind of a frontier and people will always dream of going beyond it. Maybe industry has taken the place of nature and maybe romanticism is dead but psychologists go on asking the question: "Whom or what would you like to take with you on a lonely island?" And people go on dreaming that they will spend their lives like Robinson Crusoe with their favourite show-business star, or favourite pet or book but not with their personal computer.
BGSU1002  BGSU1002:0002.1:1  icle_bgsu1002  0  623  Nowadays there is a growing interest in higher education and almost every young person wishes to have a university diploma. I would not say that university degrees are useless; of course, they have their value but I think that the university courses are rather theoretical. They do not prepare students for the real life outside the university walls. The courses deal mainly with theoretical problems and general concepts. The specialization begins quite late, the practice is inadequate and is not always up to the requirements that real work will set to the students after they leave the university.
BGSU1002  BGSU1002:0002.1:2  icle_bgsu1002  623  480  In my opinion most of the courses taken by first and second year students aim at acquiring general knowledge, instead of specialized which the students will need in their later study and work. General knowledge is not a bad thing in principle but sometimes it turns into a mere waste of time. I could point out as an example the course in Latin I took last year. I must say I have forgotten everything I once knew, just because I think I will never need Latin in my future work.
BGSU1002  BGSU1002:0002.1:3  icle_bgsu1002  1103  71  So, is it not more useful to spend a year studying a modern language?
BGSU1002  BGSU1002:0002.1:4  icle_bgsu1002  1174  605  Besides being oriented towards general knowledge some of the courses are too theoretical. Agood example is the course in Informatics that first year students take.Computers are becoming more and more important in our life and today every educated person is expected to be able to work with computers.The university course, however, dealt more with theoretical problems rather than with actual computer skills. The lectures we had were quite useless for people with no technical education and instead of trying to memorize incomprehensible data we could have spent more time working with the computers.
BGSU1002  BGSU1002:0002.1:5  icle_bgsu1002  1779  606  Another problem that students of foreign philologies are confronted with is the lack of opportunity to practice the language in a country where it is spoken. Students in law and medicine, for example, have one year of practice before starting work but students in philology do not have many chances to live and study abroad. Something that puzzles me when speaking about practice, is the fact that you can specialize in literature, linguistics or translation but you have compulsory practice in teaching. This practice is obviously of no importance to students who have no intention of becoming teachers.
BGSU1002  BGSU1002:0002.1:6  icle_bgsu1002  2385  608  In my opinion university education deals with too much theory and not enough practice. Students have to study subjects which are not closely related to the subject they want to specialize in. They have to study in details how things are done but sometimes they do not have the opportunity to do them themselves. That is why some students feel that the university does not prepare them for real life. Moreover, young people can see examples of men who have succeeded in their business and in life in general without university degrees, which is a kind of a proof of the saying that life is the best teacher.
