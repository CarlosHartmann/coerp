I. TOuching her Earthly Parentage. This M
Sarah Wight, was daughter to Mr. Thomas
Wight, sometimes of the Auditors Office, and of the
Exchequers Office: Her earthly dwelling is now with
her faithful Mother M Mary Wight, widow, in
Lawrence Pountney-Lane, by Caning-street in LONDON:
Whose Father was Mr Edward Purcel Esquire,
of Ansloo near Shrewbury: and whose former Husband
was Mr. Edward Vaughan Esquire, the Kings
Receiver, and Surveyer for Northampton-shire, and
for Rutland-shire: by whom she had her son
Mr. Jonathan Vaughan, now of All-souls in Oxford.
Who not long since writ thence a Conciliatory
Letter to this his sorrowful Sister SARAH,
therein saying thus: Doest thou despair, because
thy Tempter is a Lion for his strength? Behold the
Lion of the Tribe of Judah, Christ the mighty
God: who can and will deliver thee out of his paw.
A fountain laid open for sin, and for uncleanness.
I verily believe, that although for the present
you lie among the pots, of no use: yet thy God will
make thee a Vessel of Honour, an instrument fit for
thy Masters use; whereby he will square sinners, to
his own glory, &c.] This in his Letter is now fulfilled,
and fulfilling. She that was born of flesh
and blood, borne in sin; and that was by Nature
a child of wrath: is now borne from above,
borne of God, having given to her Faith
and Love: and has Jesus Christ
to her Brother, and God to her
Father, and her dwelling place: He
dwelling in her, and she in him: Let
him and her that glories, not glory
in the flesh, but in the Lord alone.
II. Touching her Education: In the time of her
Mothers deep afflictions of Spirit, and sore Temptations,
she was well trained up in the Scriptures,
by her godly faithful Grand-mother, M Wight
of Daintree. And when the Lords time of Love
was, that he vouchsafed to manifest his Grace
in Christ to her Mothers soul, then the Lord
brought her home to her, she being then about 9
years old. She gave her self much to read and
study the Scriptures: Which though she then understood
not aright; yet the Lord by his Holy
Spirit brought to her remembrance, and opened to
her since her restoring, what formerly she had
read; for great comfort and soul-refreshing to her
self, and to many others; as hereafter follows.
Which is a great encouragement to all that fear
God, to train up their children in the holy Scriptures;
as, 2 Tim. 3. 15. Chap. 1. 5. Prov. 22. 6. Deuteronomy.
6. 6, 7. Gen. 18. 19.
III. Touching her afflictions. From her childhood
she was of a tender heart, and oft afflicted in
Spirit: Her Temptations were not so great, till
she was about twelve years old; since which, they
have continued with more violence till April 6.
1647. it being about 4. years. [Shee is not sixteen
years old (as her Mother saith,) till September
following.]
The beginning of her more violent Temptations
was thus: Her superior bid her do a small
thing, judging it meet and lawful: She did it,
doubtingly, fearing it was unlawful: and as she
did it, a great Trembling in her hands and body
fell upon her: being condemned in her self. About
a month after, returning home, having been abroad,
she had lost her hood, and knew she had
lost it. Her Mother asked her, for her hood. She
suddenly answered, My Grand-mother has it.
Her heart condemned her instantly, and trembled
again exceedingly. And these were the first chief
occasions of her deep despair: And upon this,
she had cast into her Conscience, that she was
both a Thief, and a liar, and was terrified ever since,
that she was shut out of Heaven, and must be
damned, damned.
In the last four years, she was oft in such extremities,
she could believe nothing but Hell and
Wrath - to be her Portion; and other times, that
there was no heaven, nor hell, but in our Conscience:
and that she was damned already, being an unbeliever:
and therefore if she could but dispatch
this life of hers, there was an end of her sorrows.
A subtle deceit of the old Serpent! Hence she oft
attempted wickedly to destroy her self, as by
drowning, strangling, stabbing, seeking to beat
out her brains, wretchedly bruising, and wounding
her self. The chief cause of such weakness since
But the Lord who is her life, and loved her
then in her blood, he wonderfully prevented her
destruction, many ways. Sometimes by one or
other at that instant, sometimes staying her in the
acting, when no creature was by: Sometimes by
bringing to her mind some choice Scripture: as
this, No weapon formed against thee, shall prosper, (Isa.
54.17.) or this, None shall take them out of my hand;
or, out of my Fathers hand (Joh. 10.28, 29) This
stopped her sinful act, but the comfort stayed not.
Many precious Ministers came to comfort her:
In London these, Mr Thomas Goodwin, Mr Barker,
Mr Lockyar, Mr Palmer their Minister in Lawrence
Pountney, Mr Sprig, Mr John Simpson, and others.
And these came to her in or near Shrewsbury,
Mr Hildershame of Felton, Mr Paget (Father of Dr
Paget now of London) Mr Wright of Wellington,
Mr Smith, Mr Fisher, Mr Blake, Mr Morgan Floyd,
Mr Moston: All these and many more godly Ministers
and precious Christians, being acquainted
with her sad condition, endeavoured to comfort
her: and she gladly would have received comfort;
but it was then hid from her.
Some glimpse she had, especially by means of
her kinsman, Mr John Browne, of Shrewsbury (a
faithful and loving man) and by one whom he
brought with him, viz. Mr Daniel Floyd: but it was
soon eclipsed again; and she remained in grievous
horror day and night; concluding she was
a Cast-away, a Reprobate, walking daily in the
midst of fire and brimstone, as one in Hell already.
Till the Lord (who had loved her with an
everlasting love, and in loving kindness prevented
her ruin,) at last restored comforts to her, and to
those that had prayed and mourned for her.
And since her much prayed- and hoped-for-deliverance,
amongst many that have visited her,
were these Ministers; Mr Palmer, Mr Sprig, and
Mr Simpson beforesaid, Mr Peters, Mr Charnock of
London, Mr Atherley of the Charterhouse (with his
wife,) Mr Hide of Wighton in Yorkshire, and the
Realtor. Also the Lady Willoughby, the Lady Renula,
and the Lady Clotworthy, the Lady Vermuiden,
with her daughters M Sarah, and M Katharine,
Sir Ric: Philips, and his Lady, dau: to Dr Oxenbridg,
Sir Richard Saltonstall, with his Lady, Dr Coxe, D
            
Debote, Dr Worsley, Dr Paget, Physicians; M Palmer,
wife to Mr Palmer. Also M Fines, wife to my
Lord Says eldest Son, and M Harrison, wife to the
Chamberlain of London, M Sarah Jones, wife to Mr
Tho. Jones Esquire of Tower-hill, Col. Langhams
wife, daughter to the Lady Roberts; Mr and M
Liggon, Capt. Price, and his wife, M Wilson at
Nags-head; M Lane, Mr P. Barbon, and his wife;
M Owen, and M Hannah Allen, Bookseller, M
Manning of Tower-street, M Elizabeth Waldo,
sister to Mr John Pocock; Mr Ellis and M Ellis, M
Hawkins, M Flood, and M Their, all near London-stone;
and her cousins Mr Brigs Taylor and
his wife, M Barney of Norfolk and of their nearer
neighbours, Mr Lewes Merchant, M Thurrel,
M Grace Philips, MDupper, M Aires, &c. Besides
her Brother Mr Jonathan Vaughan, of All-souls
in Oxford, & her uncle Mr James Wight of Southa:
and his wife, and other two Ants, M Anne and
M Mary Wight. Many more might be named, who
have seen her of late, and have been much affected
in hearing of the Lords wonderful workings, in,
and towards her: But these are sufficient to witness
what they have seen, or heard, and believe:
many of them being persons of note, and of much
esteem in London amongst them that fear the Lord.
The naming of them, the Realtor desires may not
be offensive to any of them, seeing it is done for the
more assuring this great and memorable work of
Gods mercy, to some that (like Thomas) will not
believe it, unless (at least) they may speak with
some, that have been present with her.
About a month before her great deliverance, Satan
having but a short time so to torment her, her
storms and tempests were greatest of all. She was
grievously hurried with Temptations; so terrified,
she could not rest at all, for many days and
nights together. Whilst she was able to go abroad,
her Mother would have her go with her
to hear Sermons, on the Lords days, and on the
Lecture-days there. One Lecture-day she was gone
forth before her Mother; who missing her, went
to the Assembly, and not finding her there, came
forth, and suddenly went, and sent towards
Thames to seek her: where she had been, to have
cast her self in, but was stayed from it by the
power and goodness of God: and being found,
she had a command on her spirit to go to hear
that Sermon, and her Mother coming to her, she
readily yielded to go with her Mother to the
Lecture there. Where was proved, what favour
God will show towards the stock of the Jews,
that he will gruff multitudes of them into their own
Olive, pardoning their sins against Christ, restoring
them to great dignity, &c. He that preached
went in to M Wights house there after the
Sermon, and spoke with her daughter, asking her,
if the Lord spoke any peace to her thereby. She
answered, she would not for all the world, but she had
heard that Sermon. Being asked, why so? She said,
That God will show mercy to the Jews; and they are
the basest people on earth; that so hate the Name of
Christians, and much more Christ himself: and
yet that God will call them; This supported her a
little at that present; but it stayed not with her,
and she was again under horrid Temptations,
to believe there was no God, and no Devil: no Heaven,
and no Hell, but what she felt within her.
One day being strongly carried on in that temptation,
that there was no other Hell, but here in the
Conscience, As that famous M Honywood had said
and done with a Venice Glass, (who said she was
as sure to be damned, as that was to break; and therewith
threw it from her to break it; and yet it
brak not;) so did she with a little white drinking
cup, and earthen cup; she said, As sure as this
cup shall break, there is no other Hell: and therewith
she threw the cup with violence, against the far
side of the chamber; and though it light against
the wood, it brak not. Her mother took it up, and
said, Lo here child, it is not broke. She got it again,
and suddenly said and did it so again, and again,
and once against the edge of the door: thus she
struggled, and did four or five times, and yet it
brake not; but at the fifth time a little nip brake
out. And now since the Lord has created peace
to her, she has desired to drink still out of that
her white cup: till their Water-bearer unawares
cast it down, and then it brake all to pieces.
In her despairing fits, she several times would
turn to the places in Job, and in Jeremy, where
they cursed the day of their birth; and she said to
this effect; Job cursed the day wherein he was borne,
and said, Wherefore have thou brought me forth of the
womb? Oh, that I had given up the ghost, and no eye
had seen me. She turning to the places, Job 3.3.
Job 10.18. And (Jer. 20. 14. to the end) Jeremy
cursed the man that brought tidings of his birth, with
bitter curses, because his mothers womb was not his
grave, and said; Wherefore came I out of the womb,
to see toil and sorrow, that my days should be consumed
with shame? But she said, Have not I much more
cause to say so, then they had? for they were in a blessed
condition: but I am cursed, and must be a fire-brand
of Hell for ever.
These and many other desperate expressions,
she frequently used, especially in the last month
of her sorrows. When they increased daily, so
that her soul was exceedingly troubled, and she
was, as it were all shattered to pieces. And she
was so weary of her life, and of her self, and of
every thing, she was never at such a pass, in such
extremity, in all her life before.
Her tender and good Mother, attending on her
continually day and night, to prevent her mischiefing
her self; being still upheld with great
hopes, that the Lord in his good time, would
come in to her with his consolations, yea, she was
verily persuaded so. (as was also her Brother in
Oxford,) And this made her sore task the more
easy; which else had been intolerable. Yet when
this extremity had continued long, so that for
many days and nights together, her mother had
taken no rest. At last she was even wearied out
with continual watchings, and to the end her self
might enjoy some rest, to prevent harm to her self,
she had spoke to a friend, desiring that her
daughter might be for a little season with her;
which her friend was very willing unto, and her
daughter was desirous to go with her, that her
Mother might enjoy rest. But the Lord prevented
both in his goodness. For when her friend was
come, her daughter was taken with such an exceeding
trembling, and such extremity of sorrow
and trouble and weakness, that she was not able
to go with her. A forerunner of her deliverance.
Then her Mother procured a maid that feared
God, to help to look to her, who came that same
day of her so trembling, being Tuesday April 6.
When the maid beforesaid came to her, she found
her weeping most bitterly, & wringing her hands
grievously, saying, I am a Reprobate, a Castaway, I
never had a good thought in all my life. I have been under
sin ever since I can remember, when I was but a
child, &c.
This heaviness was greatest, this night was
darkest of all, when the day, the joyful time of
her deliverance was near at hand. And like as at
the beginning of her grievous despairing, about
four years ago, upon those two sins beforesaid,
a great trembling fell upon her at the beginning
of her deep despair and trouble: so now, at
the ending there of, the like trembling fell upon
her, such as she never had at any other time.
And now, thus trembling exceedingly, and weeping,
and wringing her hands, she said to this effect:
My earthly Tabernacle is broken all to pieces;
and what will the Lord do with me? If I should hang
on Gibbets, if I should be cut in pieces, if I should die
the cruelest death that ever any did, I have deserved it,
I would still justify God, aye if he cast me to hell.
(Thus the Lord caused Job, to humble himself, and
justify the Lord, when his restoring was at hand.)
Her hands and her feet were clunched, so as she
could not stand. She was tempted to blaspheme
God and die. And when she was urged to speak,
her tongue was smitten. Afterwards she being laid
down, she said to her Mother, Isle lie still, and hear
what God will say to me: He will speak Peace, Peace.
If God will speak a word of Peace at the last moment,
I should be contented. Then she desired them that
none might trouble her, but that she might lie in
peace. And she lay still, as in a sleep, or as in a
trance rather, from that tuesday night, April 6.
till the last day of that week (called Saturday) at
night; except when she called for a little water to
drink, and drunk two or three cups of water. No
other sustenance she took all that time. And this
was the time of love, when the exceeding riches of
Grace was advanced.

OliveWherefore have thou brought me forth of the

April 20. at night, there being divers neighbours
and loving friends come together to see her,
M Collet, M Caron, M Dupper, the Realtor, and
divers others, about twelve or more, which greatly
desired to hear her speak, being much taken and
greatly refreshed with what they had heard of her,
(thanksgivings having been made in her behalf,
both in that parish, and in Ab-Church their neighbour
Parish, and elsewhere, where prayers had
been put up in her behalf,) she now lying still,
and had not spoken two days together since April
6.
These desiring if the will of God were so, that
they might hear her self speak: she lying with a
linen cloth over her eyes, which were very weak;
the maid told her, Mr Jessey was there; (he being
in the company, near to her,) she then began to
speak to him, and said; O magnify the Lord with
me, for he has delivered me from all my fears: not
from one, but from all my fears. This she spoke, as
all that follows, with a low voice, in a humble,
modest, melting manner, her tears sometimes
stopping her speech. He and the rest, listened, and
were greatly affected in hearing her. It cannot affect
so much in hearing it at second hand, as if you
had heard her self, with such brazenness of heart
uttering it. Proceeding on thus, (which presently
was writ down:) He has regarded the low estate,
the base estate of his hand-maid. I rejoice in him. Imourn over him, whom I have pierced. It was not Judas
or Soldiers so much, as I that pierced him. I thought
I was the bad Thief: but he has said to me as to the
good Thief, Thou shalt be with me in Paradise.
The earthly Paradise, was a Type of the Heavenly Paradise.
That was fading and lost; but this endures for
ever.
O praise the Lord with me, for he has heard me,
and looked on me, the vilest of sinners, the worst, the
chiefest of sinners: On me, that was rebellious, disobedient,
unthankful, unholy; a murmurer, as much as
ever the children of Israel in the wilderness, (the tears
oft trickling down, and she stopping, through her
weeping,) and their murmuring kept them out of Canaan,
but though I have so murmured, he has saved
me. I was at the very pits brink, at the very brink of
hell: and the Lord fetched me out. And is not he worthy
of praise? The Lamb is worthy to open the Book.
For none in Heaven nor earth, neither men nor Angels,
could open these brazen gates, this iron door, this
hard heart of mine, but he. [putting her hand to her
own breast.] When I confessed my sin, he forgave me the
punishment. I could never confess my sin, till now, that
he made known his mercy to me, though I sought it diligently
to confess it. Being asked when was this that
she confessed her sin? She said, Now since I saw his
mercy. And now he has made known to me his mercy.
Nothing but the sense of his mercy, could ever bring me
to confess my sin with meltings. I would fine have
got comfort by mine own workings, my own doings,
or from a Creature, and I spoke to men: but I never
could get comfort by the creature, but the Lord himself
did it. I could not love him, till he made known his
love to me: to me, the chiefest of sinners. If all the sins
in all the world, were in one party, I thought it was all
nothing to mine. I could not find any in all the Scriptures
that obtained mercy, that was in my case. Yet he
has showed mercy to me, the chiefest of sinners. O, that
he should come from the bosom of the Father, to die for
sinners! for me, the chiefest of sinners. If all the men
in the world should have told me, that Christ died for
me; that my sins were pardoned, I could not have believed
them. But now, if all the men in the world, and
Angels and Devils, should tell me they are not forgiven,
I would not believe them.
What pains did I take in going to men, to have
them speak comfort to me, and they could not do it.
But Christ did it in a moment. They that know his
Name, will trust in him: they cannot but trust in him.
If the world knew him, they could not but love him.
He is the chiefest of ten thousands. He is more to be desired
in his lowest estate, then millions of worlds, if
millions of worlds were all in one.
Behold, O daughter of Jerusalem: Thy King comes
meek, that he might teach his people meekness. He came
on an Asses Colt: not on a horse finely trimmed, to an untamed
heifer, unaccustomed to the yoke; (to me, that was
ungodly, unprepared) to Ephraim, that was as a
wild Asses colt. Surely, after I was turned, I repented.
I could not turn to him, nor love him, till he showed
his love to me, and turned me.
Praise the Lord with me, that has showed mercy on
one in so desperate a case as I was in. I could set nothing
before me, but curse, and hell, and wrath, night and
day. O that others may hear what God has done for
such a one: I would none may despair of Gods mercy,
that has done thus for me. If any did know what it
is to murmur against God, and against a parent, as I
have done, and felt what I have felt, they would never
do it.
"The Realtor having heard she now had not eaten
any thing at all for twenty-four days or
more, and drunk nothing in all this time since
April 6. but only fair water, neither that, but
two or three little cups together, once in two or
three days." He desired her, if she could, to eat,
to preserve life: for when the Lord saith, Thou
shalt not kill: he implies the Affirmative, Thou shalt
use all good means to preserve life. And though he,
and all those present, being so affected, even to admiration,
in hearing a child so speak, yet he wished
her to forbear speaking too much; because it spent
her, she being so very weak. She said; In rest and
returning shall I be saved, in quietness and confidence
shall be my strength. I have Manna to eat of, he feeds
me with hidden Manna. It was pleasant to the eye:
but they felt no sweetness, by looking on it, but by tasting
of it. When she ceased her speaking, having
desired he would praise the Lord with her, he performed
accordingly, those beforesaid being present.
Another time, when one gave her a Poesy, she
looking on it, and smelling its sweetness, commended
the workmanship of God in the several flowers:
saying to this effect; The flowers are all fragrant,
and some more fragrant then others, they have different
colours, and different smells: and all come out of the
earth. So are the Saints, they all are in Christ, and in
him they all are sweet and savoury: but are of different
strength, and judgement. The strong should bear with
the weak, and not despise them.
April 25. being the Lords day, when many Christians
were come to see her, amongst others, Mr and
M Liggon, Mr A. M Jones, M Aires, M Gr. Philips,
and others.
In like humble manner, her face being covered,
and lying still, (as she had kept her bed, being very
weak, since April 6.) with a low voice, as speaking
to her self, she said: How sweet is it to my
thoughts, that an infinite God, should be a Rock and a
Refuge to a finite Creature! a sure Rock and hiding
place, from all storms and tempests whatsoever.
When the man was wounded by thieves, and lay by
the way; the Priest and the Levite passed by: they passed
by and helped not: The creature comfort fails: and
then the good Samaritan helps. Christ saves, when
none else will or can: and when there's nothing in the
Creature to move him. The wounded man did not first
desire the Samaritans help. The deeper the wound is,
the more honour to him that cures him. He set him on
his own Beast, leaves him not to himself, to go where
he will: but brought him in, and gave two pence for
him. I believe that holds out Faith and Love. None
cared for him, refuge failed, then Christ helps, and takes
care for him.
One speaking to her of her former condition,
how far she was then from hope ever to obtain
mercy, she said; If all the world should be saved, then
it may be, I should be one; but else no hopes for me. That
Peter, Mary Magdalen, David, Manasses were saved;
it was nothing to me: no, if Judas should be saved,
yet should not I. All their sin, and Paul's in Persecuting,
and the Thief on the Cross, and Judas, and
all I could read of, or hear of, if all their sins were all
put together in one; yet all were not so bad as I. Yet I
obtained mercy, that thought my time of mercy was
past, and that I was damned already through unbelief.
I said many a time, There's no hope in thy end:
and I thought I saw it. I may say, it was good for me
to be afflicted, I prize his mercies the more. All terrors
could not humble me; but the sight of his mercy did.
I could never be kindly humbled till then. It was not
mine own fitting, or mine own humbling, but Christs
fitting, and Christs humbling; when he looks upon
such a one; that humbles. He comes with his power on
the soul, and causes the soul to believe.
My tongue was not able to tell the misery I was in
before continually: and now my tongue is not able to tell
what love and mercy has been showed to me, I can never
enough express his Name. I would fine have been
dissolved, to be with him. It was a hard thing for me
to be content to live here still: but its easy for him to
teach, to be willing to live or die: and he has taught
me.
I was so desperate, I cared not what became of me:
oft was I at very brink of death and hell: even at the
very gates, and they were open for me; and then Christ
shut them, and fetched me out: at Daniel that was in
the Lyons den, but it was his mercy that stopped the
mouth of the roaring Lion, and delivered me.
The hundredth and seventh Psalm; O that men
would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness,
and declare the wonders that he does for the children
of men. I would that Psalm were often read
over. The goodness of God is unsearchable. How great
is the excellency of his Majesty; that yet he would look
upon such a one as I! I was full of Terror the week before
I kept my bed: I rested not day nor night. I thought
no death was bad enough for me. If all kinds of deaths
were put together in one, it was too good for me. I walked
continually as in fire and brimstone, for rebelling
and murmuring against God, and against a Parent.When he hides his face, who is able to bear it?
and when he gives quietness, who then can trouble?
[Job 34.29.] I can testify the truth of both
these. He has spoke the word to me, Thy sins are forgiven
thee; I even I am he that blotted out thy
transgressions for mine own sake.  Jesus Christ is
unchangeable, therefore I was not consumed. Wee may
say with admiration, What is man, that thou art so
mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou so
regard him! thou made him lower then Angels.
Jesus Christ took our nature,
to take part of our sufferings; and that
we should follow him in sufferings, and
not think strange. Wee have not a High
Priest, that cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities,
but he was made like to us, that he might
sympathize with us, [Heb. 2. 17, 18. & Heb. 4. 15.]
Bless the Lord, O my soul! Which forgives all thine
iniquity; and heals all thine infirmity. In my misery
my flesh and my bones pined, and consumed away,
and I was near to death.[the Lords chearing the
heart does good like a medicine:] I now recover
strength. I read the Scriptures from a child: but I
understood not what I read till now, that I had the
Teaching of the Spirit.
He is worth the waiting for him. There is a blessing
pronounced to such, Blessed are all that wait for him.
I did not wait patiently for him. I was weary, and
could wait no longer. But he is not weary: He fails
not. He lets the Creature go his way for a time, for his
own good, to humble him more, and show his mercy the
more. He has him in a chain, and the enemy in a
chain. So he has the soul, to dispose of it. (My times
are in thy hands:) that he might magnify mercy indeed,
and free love indeed. No soul ever was as I have
been: I am sure of it. If all the sins of all sinners that
I read of, or heard talk of, were in one, it were all short
of me. And yet it is his goodness that such a one as I,
should obtain mercy. I wish all may take heed of
censuring the wildest creatures that
are, seeing the Lord has done thus
for me the wildest Creature: but pity
them with tears of blood.Thou shalt be with me in Paradise.Thou
shalt not killO that men
would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness,
and declare the wonders that he does for the children
of men.When he hides his face, who is able to bear it?
and when he gives quietness, who then can trouble?Thy sins are forgiven
thee; I even I am he that blotted out thy
transgressions for mine own sake. What is man, that thou art so
mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou so
regard him! thou made him lower then Angels.
