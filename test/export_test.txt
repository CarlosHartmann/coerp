Title: The grace and 
favour of God / our heavenly father / 
purchased unto us / by the bloody 
death of Christ our Saviour / befelt 
and increased in all your conscience / too 
your everlasting 
consolation.
 
                  
THe violence of this age 
does not suffer me / my most 
loving brethren / to come (as 
I would do) unto you / and by 
talk & brotherly conferring / 
to put you in mind of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ / which amongst 
others far more worthy / even I by 
Gods grace preached among you. I therefore 
have thought needful by these letters / now 
to do the same / now I say when though 
the perverse frowardness of men / the true 
preaching of Christ's Gospel is banished 
and mans doctrine is taught with lies & 
fables: And though some perchance will 
think that this longs not to me / but too 
him that is your Pastor to do / yet for 
as much as once I was your pastor / I cannot 

but testify / that some piece of pastoral 
cure does yet rest in my heart towards 
you. The which in deed does much persuade 
me / as the present necessity also seems 
no less to require / to make a long & a 
large treatise / by which you might have an 
whole armour against all the assaults off 
false Prophets. But when I consider / how 
truly / and that with much diligence you have 
been taught / and therewith thinking / that 
you are not forgetful hearers of the word / I 
think that among you it shall suffice / if I 
do but name those greatest evils / which 
now are poured forth out of pulpits among 
you / and therewith put you in mind 
of the truth / contrary to these lies / which 
once you both heard and received / desiring 
you to abide in the same. This will I do 
shortly / as I have but little / and the same 
unapt time to do it / yet truly I trust to do 
it / as let Gods word therein try it. If first 
you will suffer me to tell you / that through 
these false Prophets / the castle of your 
health / the salvation of your souls is assaulted / 
whom if you suffer too be with you 
if you yield up your selves to the believing & 
following of their doctrine / then know you 
that as by blind liars you be led / so you
with them then being blinded / shall with 
them fall in to the pit of partition, which 

is prepared as well for the falsely seduced / 
as for the false seducer. Of this I could 
be content to speak the less / but that I see 
that whilst of to many / and that Londoners / 
these beasts befooled. You have even 
drawn and pulled upon your heads those 
abominations / which if but reason had 
ruled / should not have been admitted before 
that by laws they had been thrust unto 
you / that I speak not / what true Christianity 
should have moved you too have 
done. 
Oh London / London / is this the gospeling 
fruicte / to be the first / that without a 
law shouldest banish true preaching out 
of the / too be the first that against laws 
shalt admit that massing Idolatry / to be 
the first that shall give the example of stumbling 
to all England / which shouldest yet 
have been the first in constancy / in humble / 
saying for the continuing of the truth in 
the / in quiet and patient suffering for the 
truths sake even death / if by the rulers it 
had been offered the. That ground art 
thou / which not in persecution / but before 
persecution comes does go back / a ground 
thou art reserved for the Lords woeful 
cures / to whose judgment London I leave 
the. 
Seeing in London these evils are received / as 

it is now meet for vigilante Pastors too 
watch over their flock / to chase the wolf 
away / less at the Lords hand they do 
hear the name of hirelings / so now is it 
high time for you my loving brethren / and 
all them that be the children of God to take 
heed whose voice you do hear / too beware 
of the leaven of papistical Pharisees / and 
to keep your selves undefiled from all their
abominations. The greatest of which 
now I will resit amongst all their abominations / 
one of the principal is their doctrine 
of transubstantiation / the very pride 
of papistry / and the horrible offence / even 
of the Turks and Heathen. That a popish 
priest / by his huffing and buzzing / and 
mumbling up of the words of Christ / 
more like a Conjurer then a Christian / 
should work that miraculous alteration 
and changing of the substance of bread 
and wine / into the substance of the body 
and blood of Christ / which then is to be 
taken / as Christ him self God and man / & 
so to be adored. But you know my dear 
brethren / that there is no such miracle too 
be believed without the certain doctrine of 
Gods word to warrant the same / which the 
papists can never show / & therefore their 
miracle is not to be believed / Christ in Instituting 
the Supper / meant not to leave there 

his body and blood really and substantially 
as the papists do teach: For Christ in the 
substance of his body / was then to be crucified/ 
he was to die / he was to rise again / 
he was to ascend / and he was / and in the same 
yet now is / to appear before the glorious 
God / our Bishop / advocate / & mediator / 
there so to remain until the last 
day / as the scriptures do teach. In the 
Supper he instituted a commemoration 
of the breaking of his body / and shedding 
of his blood / to be done and made of them that do eat that bread / and drink of that 
cup / according to his institution: which 
he called his body and blood / for that it is 
to the receivers a seal and confirmation 
of Christ's body broken / and Christ's blood 
shed for them / that the profit and commodity 
thereof is theirs / which there do 
partake by faith. And so these words: 
This is my body, and this is my blood, are 
to be understand / and not as the transsubstantiators / 
literally enforce them. For their understanding / 
them is both contrary to Christ's 
meaning / and also to the office of his 
body / besides that it is against the nature 
of his very body. And that the same phrase 
of speaking is thus to be understanded / as 
I have said: The like phrases in like matters 
in the scriptures does sufficiently tech 

us. As whereof circumcision / the LORD 
does say: This is my covenant, where it 
was but the seal or the covenant / as Paul 
calls it. In the same sort it is said: This 
is the passover. This cup is the new Testament 
in my blood. Christ is the rock. 
And in like manner are these to be understanded. 
So that if the adversaries will give 
the / give the holy Ghost leave to expound 
him self / then these words. This is my 
body? This is my blood? are figuratively 
to be understanded. As the like Pharisees 
are / and so serve they not all for their monstrous 
transubstantiation. The second abomination 
is their sacrifice of the mass. 
In which (too let many things pass / as 
the strangeness of the tongue / the Jewish 
apparel, the fond notts, crosses, becks & 
ducks.) Three evils most notable and to a 
Christian conscience intolerable are there. 
First their wicked sacrifice / which their 
mass-book testifies / to be Propitiatory / to 
take away the sins of all those / be they 
dead or living / for whom they do say mass: 
Yea / profitable and a veil able for wars / 
peace / whether / sickness / for moraine of beasts / 
and for whatsoever you lust to be their 
application. Oh shameful blasphemy. As 
concerning the sacrifice Propitiatory for 
sin / you must hold the anchor of your faith 

that this sacrifice Christ him self once offered 
for all in his own bloody death. He was 
the priest & the sacrifice / the offerer and the 
thing offered / & by his own bloody offering 
purified he in the shedding of his blood all 
his from sin. By it purchased he eternal 
sanctification & salvation for them that shall be 
saved: & by it finished he for ever / the full propitiation 
for sins: for saying these words 
it is finished or consummate / he yielded 
up the ghost. Detestable therefore is the papistical 
sacrifice & injuries to the bloody 
death of Christ. 
Christ instituted this supper to be a sacrament 
to us / and not that of it a priest should 
make a propitiatory sacrifice for sin: In 
the eating & drinking of it / that we should declare 
the Lords death / offering the sacrifice 
of thanks therefore (and therefore is it 
called of the fathers a sacrifice of thanks) 
and not leaving any more sacrifice propitiatory 
for sin too any priest too offer: 
That we eating and drinking / according 
too his institution / should by faith apply 
unto our consciences / the benefit of his 
death and passion / and not giving power 
too any priest by messing too apply the benefit 
of his death / to whom and to what 
he lists. 

Christ ordained his Supper neither for 
the dead / which have no use of eating and 
drinking with us in the congregation: nor 
yet for beasts / whether/ nor war / for which 
Christ did not die: but for his church living 
upon this earth / that needs his word / & 
needs his Sacraments / for the confirming 
of their faith. 
Thus plainly / you see one mischievous 
misuse in this mass. The second evil is / 
that the bread and cup (which the Lord 
instituted too be received of the faithfully 
with thanks giving) In their mass they 
do abuse / and make of it an Idol / holding it 
up for the people / not only to gaze upon / 
but to give unto it that honour / which is 
due unto God alone: And so both make 
of it an Idol / and of the people gross Idolaters / 
and transgressors of Gods commandment. 
The filthiness of which Idolatry / 
I know you do see so plain / that I need not 
wish many words to impugn it / for a 
Christian conscience can not but abhor it. 
The third evil is that in their mass / that 
that is eaten and drunken is done & devoured 
of the priest all alone / with quartering 
and sopping / with licking and supping / 
with washing and wiping / and such pretty 
tricks of their own inventing. Christ in 
his institution appointed this supper too 

be celebrate of the whole congregation. Take 
you, and drink you all of this says he: This 
do you in remembrance of me. For so oft 
as you eat this bread / and drink of this cup 
you show the Lords death till he comes. 
Christ and Paul speaks not to the priest 
alone / but too the whole congregation / too 
observe this ordinance of eating and drinking 
at the Lords supper: Whereby you 
may plainly see how contrary this doing 
of our popish massers is in this also to the 
Institution of Christ. And too be short in 
this their whole mass is nought / else but 
an horrible profanation of the Lords supper: 
Wherefore as a most injurious blasphemy / 
too the blood of Christ / as a most 
gross Idolatry / as a most wicked profanation 
of Christ's institution / of all Christians 
is this mass to be eschewed and abhorred. 
Out of his mischievous Idol the mass / 
form they unto the people / a new found sacrament 
of their own inventing: delivering 
to the people (as they say) through the 
miracle of their transubstantiation a body / 
in which body / because also there is blood 
therefore / they do not minister their consecrated 
cup accordingly / for fear of spilling 
and yet they give drink to their household 
to wash down the crimes withal. Oh 

thieves where learn you too minister such a 
sacrament. Where have you your ground in 
the scripture for this / your unwholesome housell. 
Who can with a good conscience receive 
such a new found Popish sacrament at a 
papists hand / saying also it is thereto off 
them used / to put Christ's true institution 
out of his true use. Whose appointed ordinance 
is that the bread of thanksgiving / 
and the cup of thanksgiving should be 
eaten and drunken of the congregation / as 
before I said. 
This their new found Sacrament 
they hang up in the pit / they carry abroad 
in processions to be adored / with many 
such mischiefs of their own inventing / 
which to reckon up / all were an endless labour. 
I leave them therefore ever listening 
when I may hear them defend these their 
abominations by the written word off 
God / but this as they never yet could do / 
so shall they never be able to do it / and therefore 
of all Christians are they with their 
evasions to be forsaken. 
In the doctrine of Justification they 
wander enwrapped in laberin these mextricable. 
They err in extenuating sin 
both original and actual / in not understanding 
the law / the force of it (I mean) nor 

the end of it / in making a Justification / 
partly of Christ's grace / partly of mans 
free will / good motions and good works / 
and herein they so enwrap them selves 
with their terms of the first grace / the second 
grace / grace president / grace concomitating / 
grace following / with merit of 
congruence / and merit of condignity / that 
neither understand thee true justification / 
neither can other men understand 
what they do mean by their Justification: 
But their doctrine is too bring men into 
a continual doubting of salvation / and 
leads them clean from that free Justification / 
which we have in Jesus Christ. 
But you my brethren have out of the scriptures 
received / and I trust by the practises 
of your own consciences have tasted. 
That by nature you are the children 
of wrath of yourselves: as of yourselves 
that you are but such a lump of sin / that 
in you dwells no good thing. For 
which the law justly condemned you 
as guilty of Gods curse and wrath / and 
so drives you too Christ. By whose 
grace you be freely justified. 
By whose bloodshedding / only 
and alone / the atonement is now made 

between God and you / which you 
believing are made the heirs of blessing / 
of which your consciences by faith being 
assured by the work of Gods spirit / you be 
at peace with God / because you do feel even 
in your hearts by lively persuasion off 
faith / that Christ has loved you / and given 
him self for you / for whose only sake 
you are justified and saved: Which you thus 
filing / are led by the same spirit that  
works this in you too render unto God 
the sacrifice of your body / in living & doing 
those works / which in his sight are acceptable / 
and that in a freedom and liberty off 
the spirit / I mean no fleshly liberty, but 
that liberty of the spirit / by which we 
dar draw ny unto the seat of Gods 
grace, calling him: Abba father / that liberty
that subdues the liberty of the flesh / 
and makes it captive & bond too serve the 
spirit. In which you also walking / when 
you have done all that you can do / if you could 
do all that is commanded you too do / yet 
saying all mans righteousness is but as a defiled 
clothe / you seek not thereby the perimplishment 
of your Justification. Which is 
all ready fully given you in Christ's Jesus / 
you like not to the merit of your good works: 
but on your part knowing your own 
want and imperfection / yea / and sin even

in the best you do / you say: we are unprofitable 
servants commending all your doings 
to the grace of God thorough Christ / 
that by him they may be made pure: on 
Gods part considering / that the good you 
do / is the work of his spirit in you / which 
works in all men / both to will & to do / 
you do give unto him the glory / saying by his 
grace only / you are that good that you are. 
Nevertheless / yet this also you know that 
the Lord / which through Christ has accepted 
you unto his grace / does of the same 
grace in Christ / accept these your works 
into his favour / as just perfect and good. 
Which though they be the works of his 
spirit in you / yet is he content to have them 
called and esteemed as yours / and as yours 
does he of his own free grace reward them 
both in this life, and in the life to come. 
In this that I have thus spoken / you see 
the force of sin original and actual / the 
force and end of the law / the power of 
mans free will / the true justification / man's 
regeneration / and the life / fruits & perfection 
of Gods regenerate child: By which 
you may the more easily perceive how far 
the papists wander from the truth of justification / 
by which they draw men into 
a desperate doubting of salvation / which 
who so likes / let them taste thereof. Here is 

occasion also given me to warn you of all 
those means that they have taught to be 
meritorious to deserve Gods grace / as works 
of superrogacion / works done of a good 
intent / fishfastes / vows / pilgrimages / pardons / 
and such like Popish trash / which 
though as yet perchance they dare not teach / 
yet have they taught / and will hereafter 
teach it. But against all such / I account 
you sufficiently armed / if you hold fast this 
that our only merit available before god / 
is the merit of Christ / which he freely gives / 
and God for his only sake freely imputes 
to all true believers / which is unto 
them full perfect / and sufficient merit / righteousness / 
sanctification / & salvation. They 
teach also invocation of saints / to make 
them mediators / if not too God for us, yet 
unto Christ to speak the better for us. 
The scripture teaches plain / that between 
God and man / there is but one mediator / 
the man Jesus Christ / who therefore became 
man / that for men he alone should make intercession / 
as for mans redemption he alone did 
die. Wherefore even he also teaches men to 
call upon the father in his name / promising 
to such that they shall be hard. 
Prayer abuse they not only in a strange 
tongue / contrary to the doctrine of Paul / 
which will have all things done in the congregation / 

to the edifying thereof : in superstitious 
numbering of a certain number of 
Psalms / or Pater nosters / of which because 
the people shall be sure / they teach them 
the use of beads / contrary unto which 
Christ our Saviour taught / condemning 
it as a pharizeeical superstition / when for 
their much clattering sake / they think them 
selves to be hard: But also they teach and 
defend praying for the dead / to be charitable 
and propitiatory. 
Where as yet the scripture teaches / that 
they that die in the Lord / are in solace and 
blessedness. As then they need not our prayers / 
so our prayers can add nought unto 
their blessedness: And on the contrary part 
they that die wickedly / have no remedy 
everlastingly: So that on all parts / this 
kind of prayer is in vain. The mother

being in most blessed safety / and with these
the time of health & grace being past / their 
curious charity therefore / and their peevish 
propitiatory prayer has no ground in the 
scriptures. But through this they have picked 
the purse of many a poor man / for on 
this unhappy ground build they chanteries / 
trentalles universaries / diriges / purgatory / 
pardons for souls departed / and a 
piece of their expiatory sacrifice / with many 
such proper devises.  

Auricular confession they teach / in which 
they enforce a numbering of sins / which 
is nought / else but the tyranny of their kingdom / 
and as they use it a killing of Christian 
consciences, and has no ground of the scriptures. 
In an anguish and duty of conscience 
it is both good / necessary / and comfortable / 
for a man to counsel with some such learned 
elder / in whose lips both lie the law 
of truth. Again / if the true ecclesiastical 
discipline were used / a piece of it ought too 
be / that the man restored / should of his 
fault make an open confession before the 
congregation / to declare publicly his repentance. 
Yea / and a minister may upon 
just ground examine any / of whom he has 
cure / of such a fault / as he sees him worth 
to be reproved for: But this is so far from 
their eareshrift / that a man most blind / 
may easily judge thereof. But the rabble of 
their errors are to many now to recite / as 
of the authority of the church / of the not 
erring of the church / of discipline / of their 
five new invented sacrament / of vows / of 
choice of meats / of images / and such like. 
Against all / which that you may be armed 
my dear brethren / I require you not only 
to call to mind the doctrine of the truth 
received. But also that for the trial of them 
you do abide in the word of the truth / Gods 

word I mean. And because / here they 
have also an error / I will but recite it / and 
so make an end. 
Their error is / that Gods written word 
is not a sufficient doctrine unto salvation / 
but (say they) the voice of the church / traditions / 
and counsels are to be hard of necessity. 
As for traditions / there is no tradition 
of any matter of faith to be received / 
other then is in the scriptures expressed. 
Likewise doctors and counsailles / with the 
consent and custom of the church / are so 
far to be hard in matters of faith / as 
they do agree with the written scripture: for 
it is the touch stone to try them all by / & 
that in such sort / that if they say not / according 
to this word / then as there is no 
light in them / so are they not to be followed. 
As for traditions / customs / and by and for 
the order of the church ceremonies received 
and used / which be no matters of faith; 
they may be admitted and altered at the discretion 
of them that have the rule of the 
church under Christ / according to the necessity 
of the time / and the disposition of the 
people / so that in them be nothing else but 
true edifying to unfeigned Godliness. And 
such are of the people with humbleness too 
be received. But for the full trial of such / 
Yea / and for the full and perfect institution 

of all men / in such things as concerning 
salvation / God has left unto his church 
and people his written word. In which 
though all things that God might have 
caused to be written / be not written. Yet in it 
so much is written / as suffices to teach us 
that Jesus Christ is the son of God / and 
also that we believing / might have life everlasting / 
as John does witness / by which 
we learn / that the written word of God. 
is a sufficient doctrine to instruct us in that 
faith / which brings to life everlasting. 
It is that sufficient doctrine that can alone 
make men learned unto salvation, by the 
faith which is in Christ Jesus / it alone suffices 
to make the man of God perfectly instructed 
too all that is good / as witnesses 
Paul. Therefore unto the scriptures do 
Christ send the Pharisees, Abraham too 
Moses and the Prophets / Peter also to 
the same word of the Prophets / as to the 
doctrine that suffices to instruct us too 
salvation. The knowledge of which word 
whosoever goes about to take from the 
people by putting it into a strange language 
to the end that the more safely / our popish 
merchants may keep their mart of falsehood 
and Popery / he robs the people of 
their mean to salvation / he opens a door 
for thieves and murderers / to devour the 

flock of Christ / and if at the worlds hand / 
he sustained not the judgment of a thief, 
yet at Gods hand shall he be sure to have 
the judgment of a soul murderer. 
Thus briefly I have put you in mind 
my dear brethren of the principal errors of 
the adversaries / and of the truth contrary 
to them / not so copiously as the matter deserves / 
but shortly measuring the need of 
your knowledge / for I have not to do now 
with the ignorant / but with you / of whom 
by the time and kind of your teaching / I 
judge that you be able not only too judge off 
the truth / but too be brotherly instructors 
of other in the same. And thus I have done 
first to exhort you constantly to abide in the 
truth received. Call to your mind that 
God of his great mercy and goodness has 
long been in planting / sowing / and watering 
of you / as it were to make you a garden off 
pleasure unto him self. These seeds of life 
the devil by his doctors will now go about 
to pick out of your hearts. But if in this 
gospeling age / you have been worthy hearers 
of the Gospel, if with the word heard 
with your ears / the Lords sprite has 
touched your hearts to believe the word of 
truth preached / as he has done to so many 
as have unfeignedly desired it / if you be the 
sheep / which have rightly heard the shepherds 

voice / then surely the strangers 
supplanting voice shall you not hear / but you 
shall flee from such hirelings / as from 
thieves / robbers and murderers. Hereby 
verily shall you be known what ground you 
are / fruitful / or unfruitful constant / or servers

of the time: Good Gospel hearers be 
not such as will be tossed about with every 
wind / they be no such ground as will be 
dried up with every blast of burning heat / 
but they abide in Gods truth / searching 
and learning the same in his holy scriptures / 
and that with such faithful diligence 
and constant obedience / that if an angel 
from heaven shall preach an other Gospel / 
they hold him accursed: Yea / and though 
there be many counterfeit Christians / 
that fall away from the Lords truth / 
yet abide they with Christ and say: Thou 
haste the words of everlasting life: Consider 
my dear brethren / that we too hear 
alone / but to keep Christ's word makes 
a man happy. And in keeping the principal 
part is too persevere in the doctrine off 
truth / this makes Christ's disciples / this 
makes you free / yea / this is it / that makes 
a man safe / for he that perseveres too 
the end / shall be saved. 
This also have I written too exhort 
you / to keep your selves undefiled from all

Popish leaven / if you do fall from the Gospel / 
and embrace Popery / you fall from 
truth to lies / from the word of light 
and life / to darkness and death / from salvation 
to damnation / from God too the 
devil. You are then they / into whom the 
evil spirit reentered with seven worse then 
him self / you are then the foolish builders 
which suffer the unrecoverable ruin. And 
as then with that filth that is in Popery / 
you be defiled with it: so of the damnation 
which is due to such abomination / you 
shall be partakers of it. But if you think 
that you can both embrace Popery and the 
Gospel / you do deceive your selves / for you 
can not both hold the taste off Christ's 
death in your consciences / and allow also 
that mass / which is the defacer of Christ's 
death / you can not embrace the right 
use of the Lords supper / and also use and 
partake the horrible profanation of the same: 
You can not by faith apprehend 
free justification / and yet seek by your righteousness 
and merits too be saved: you can 
not accept Gods written word / as the 
sufficient doctrine of salvation: and also
take mans doctrine and traditions / as necessary

to the same / and so forth of the rest. 
This can you not do both / they are so contrary. 

But if you could do it / yet may you not do it /  
for God will none of your mingled service / 
for as there is no convenience between Christ 
and Beliall / so men must not halt on both 
sides in Gods service / but either say that 
God is God / or else that Baal is god. God 
never allowed that service of the Samaritans / 
which both served their Idols / and 
worshipped the living God. But if you be 
turned to the Lord / then all strange Gods 
must you clean forsake. The Lord is God 
alone / alone therefore according to his word 
will he be served. God is over man a jealous 
God / wherefore he will have whole man 
wholly to be his alone / as our first commandment 
teaches us. Again / if you think 
that in your hearts you will serve the Lord / 
but yet you will be and may be present in parson 
at their Idolatry. For your heart shall be 
in heaven. This is but a fleshly policy / which 
fails as many as trust unto it. How can 
you / too whom Christ's death is dear: 
abide to see that whoorish thief / that steals 
from Christ the glory of his death. How 
can you / which have been and are ready to receive 
with thankfulness the Lords supper 
according to Christ's institution / abide to see 
the horrible profanation thereof? And so 
forth of the rest. But if your conscience were 
such that you could thus do / yet know you 

this / that it is against your Christian profession. 
For we are taught / that too believe 
with the heart / & to confess with the mouth 
makes a man safe. Both hearts believe / & 
mouths confession must go together / which 
does not so in you / when inwardly you are 
Gospelers / & outwardly dissemblers with 
papists. You are bought with a price (says 
Paul) glorify now God in your body and 
in your sprite, which are Gods. Saying 
both body and sprite are Gods / not only 
by creation / but bought also by redemption / 
even in the price of Christ's blood / you can 
not with a dissembling pretence / couple your 
bodies with papists / for then you do not glorify 
God in your bodies. We read not that 
any child of God / used ever justly any 
such dissimulation. Daniel used none such 
and therefore was he son accused of not adoring 
the king / Beland the Dragon. The 
three children / whether they came by compulsion / 
or came of their own mind / where
the Idol was / dissembled not / for forth with 
they were accused as transgressors of the 
kings commandment. Eleazarus would 
not dissemble / eating even of lawful flesh. 
These men glorified God in body & sprite / 
these men believed in heart / & confessed with 
the mouth / & so must you do / without any 
other musing / if you will do the office off 

Christians. And this to do not only the 
profession of Christianity enforces / but 
Christian charity also. Our doings must 
be without offence giving: But by this 
dissembling a double stumble block is given 
which even in things indifferent is to be 
avoided. For what though a Christian may 
eat freely of meats offered unto Idols / yet 
if thereby an Idolater / whose conscience in 
his superstition / should be confirmed thereby / 
it were better never to eat flesh. And 
what though all things be clean to the clean 
to be eaten on all days with thanks giving / 
yet better it is not to eat flesh / nor to 
drink wine: then too offend thereby thy 
weak brother: If this be to be observed in 
things indifferent / how much more in 
things which are absolutely evil / must you 
take heed that neither you give occasion off 
concerning the conscience of an Idolatry / 
nor yet of offending the week to draw them 
to the leek evil with you: both which you 
do / when both a papist and a week brother 
sees you as mongrels mingling yourselves 
with the Papists in their Idolatry. As 
much might I speak / how that all things 
that you do in the congregation must be 
done to edifying. But of this to have full 
instruction. I refer you to the mind off 
master Calvine / lately translated & printed 

in English. Thus now I end wishing you 
all well in the Lord. Abide in his truth / 
keep your selves undefiled. Offer your 
selves humbly to suffer all violence of bloody 
laws for the truths sake / keep safe 
your consciences / though the sword takes 
your lives from you / suffer & bear withal 
humbleness and quiet obedience. Humble 
your selves in unfeigned repentance before 
the Lord / in the horrible plague of Popery / 
that of his mercy he may be moved 
to end these days of delusion / and let 
your prayers always ascend up 
before the Lord / begging of 
him such things as 
you need. In which 
I beseech you 
to pray 
also for me.
Your loving
friend and orator. Thomas Sampson. 
The grace of our LORD Jesus 
Christ be with you all. AMEN.
