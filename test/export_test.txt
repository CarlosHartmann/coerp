Title: A Dialogue of diverse
Questions demanded of the children
to their father very necessary, and
profitable both for children, and parents,
masters and servants.
The youngest sons Question.
AFter that one of my Children
had read a Chapter unto me at
supper, out of the Acts of the
Apostles, my youngest son after supper
sitting by the fire, asked this question,


father
(saith he)

what is God?

The fathers Answer.
My son, all ye wisest Philosophers yt
ever were, could never yet comprehend or
resolve this question, the cause was, they
never searched to know him by his holy
word, but by their own natural wisdom,
by which wisdom, it is unpossible
to please God, or know him, for God
has revealed himself unto us in his
holy word although S. Paul saith, God
has revealed himself unto us by his creatures,
which are the heavens and
earth, and all things therein contained.
By which they know there is a God,
but yet neither Philosopher, nor any other
can tel what God is, but by his holy
word. In which he reveals himself
unto us, what he has done for us, and
how he has so loved us before wee
were, that he has created all things for
us, & has also given us his dear & only
son Jesus Christ, who being very
God equal with his father, came down
from heaven, and disdained not the Virgins
womb, and there took our nature
on him and was made man in all points
as we are, only sin excepted, and in
our natural flesh, was obedient even
unto the very death of the Cross, wherein
he suffered for us, the very pains of
hell both in soul and body, was dead &
buried, and rose again the third day to
justify us, and after forty days he did
ascend into heaven whence he came, &
there he will sit until the day of judgment,
having all power both in heaven
and earth, which is meant by sitting at
Gods right hand. And then he will come
and be our joyful judge, but until then
he will be with us in spirit and power,
by which spirit, we have revelation &
knowledge of him, and what God is?
And without this spirit, it is unpossible
to understand his holy will, that is revealed
in his holy word, which holy spirit,
is the holy Ghost, which holy Ghost
is the virtue and power of God, proceeding
from the father and the son, the
third person in the trinity which three
persons is but one God, which God is
almighty, unmeasurable, incomprehensible
and without all men's capacity and
wisdom. For he is a spirit, and therefore
they that will worship him, must
worship and serve him in spirit, and
truth, for otherwise, he is incomprehensible,
he is Alpha and Omega, that
is, he is the first and the last, without
beginning or end, for no man has seen
God at any time, unto whom be all honour.
Amen.

Another sons Question.
Father, you say that S. John saith, that
no man has seen God at any time. I
pray you tell us then, why God is pictured
in form like an old man, with a
long white beard & sitting in a golden
chair, how can that be except he has
been seen of some man.

The fathers answer.
My son, I say that God is neither
old, nor young, neither can any place
contain him, for he fills all places,
both in heaven and earth, and the Sea:
and therefore he is everywhere, for heaven
is his seat, and earth is his footstool,
and therefore he must have a very
great chair to contain him. Therefore
such as dare presume to paint or picture
him, in any proportion, doth commit
great and horrible blasphemy, and are
cursed of God himself. Much less like
an old man, with a long white Beard,
for that is the weakest sort of men. But
how can or dare any creature make his
Creator. Oh horrible, execrable, damnable,
vile, presumptuous cursed wretch,
that dare presume to violate and break
Gods holy precept, forbidden expressly
in the first table and the second verse.
Good children beware of such horrible
Papistical blasphemies.

Another Question of the son.
Father I heard you once say that there
was a man in Bridewell, that affirmed
by Scripture that it was not lawful to
fear God, but to love him. Must we not
fear God but love him?

The fathers answer.
In deed there was a vile fellow in
Bridewell that affirmed out of the scriptures,
& first out of the second Chap. of
S. Luke & the 17. verse, out of the song of
Zacharias, in these words, that we being
delivered out of the hands of our enemies,
might serve him without fear,
all the days of our life, but this fear is
not meant toward God, but it is that
wee should not fear Gods rigour and
justice: that he scourges the wicked
withal, but love him as a father: neither
yet fear what the wicked can
do unto us, in all their extremities or
malice, neither yet fear any of their
threats, scorns, scoffs, persecutions or
tortures whatsoever, but because God
has delivered us out of the hands of
our enemies, we should serve him
without fear all the days of our life, &
not cast off our loving fear of our good
God, that has delivered us out of the
hands of the devil, hell and damnation
for ever. Who would not fear to displease
such a good God & loving father,
also divers scriptures are our warrant
against this presumptuous villain, for
God promises great blessings unto all
such as fear him. As for example in the
book of Moses, it is set down how
God loves his own children that fear
him, as the words of the three men or
Angels affirms, when they used these
words unto Abraham: Shall God (say
they) hyde any thing from Abraham, because
he and all his house fear him. Also
Joshua or Jesus the Captain that conducted
the children of Israel after Moses,
used these words unto them: Do
you (saith he) what you will, but I and
all my house will serve and fear ye Lord.
Also the holy Prophet David has these
warrants throughout all his Psalms,
to fear God, as first in the 2. Psalm,
verse 11. Commanding (saith) see that
ye serve the Lord in trembling and in
fear. Also in the 25. Psalm. verse 3.They that fear the Lord shall know
his secrets. And in the 34. Psalm. ver.
9. 10. Fear the Lord his holy ones, for
they that fear him shall lack no good
blessing. And again, Come near my
children and I shall teach you how to
fear the Lord. And in the 128. Psa. The
holy ghost pronounces them blessed that
fear ye Lord. Also in the first Chapter
of Salomons Proverbs.verse.7. The holy
Ghost saith, That the fear of the
Lord is the beginning of wisdom. And
Eccl. in his 4. Chap. ver. 13. saith that a
poor child which fears God, is better
then a king yt dotes. Thus you proved
by warrants of scripture ye way to fear
God. Yet this wretch forges other places
out of the scripture like the devil for
his purpose. As out of the 8 Chap to To.
15. ver. in these words, ye have not rescued
that spirit of bondage that you should
fear any more: but the villain abuses
the text corruptly, for the Apostle means
no such thing, but that we should
not fear condemnation nor waver or
despair as the Papists teaches us, to
make us dwell in bondage and fear of
our salvation in Christ's merits only,
but to be ever in doubt & despair, which
pestilent doctrine makes thousands to
fear God and not love him. Fear not
him that can kill the body, but fear him
which can kill both soul and body.but I and
all my house will serve and fear ye Lord.They that fear the Lord shall know
his secrets.Fear the Lord his holy ones, for
they that fear him shall lack no good
blessing.Come near my
children and I shall teach you how to
fear the Lord.blessed that
fear ye Lord.the fear of the
Lord is the beginning of wisdom.ye have not rescued
that spirit of bondage that you should
fear any more:Fear not
him that can kill the body, but fear him
which can kill both soul and body.

The sons fourth Question.
Good father who are those that fear
God, and not love him, are there any
such, I pray you describe who they be.

The fathers answer.
All they are those which bind themselves
to the observation of Gods laws
and the popish ceremonies, and think
except they observe and keep them, they
are damned for ever. And when they see
that they are not able to keep them: them
they live in servile fear of God and his
Laws, wishing that there were neither
God, laws, nor precept. These I
say, are those that fear God, & not love
him, for they have received ye spirit of
bondage that S. Paul speaks of in
his 8. Chap. to the Rom. which carnal
spirit, makes them dwell ever in fear
of hell, and damnation, and yet toil and
moil themselves to obscure the law of
God, by their own righteousness & merits
and by their hypocritical ceremonies of
civil life. These I say, fear God as the
wicked fear the magistrates & laws of
this land, for they rather curse them them
love them, such a servile fear have ye ignorant
Atheists, the meritmongers, the papists
& the double hearted protestants, for
they fear Gods law & his judgment for
fear of damnatio~, but they love him not
Even as ye wicked fear ye Prince & her
laws for fear of Tiborn, but they love her
and her laws as well as they love Tiborn,
and all this is, because the have
neither true faith, true love, nor true
fear of God or Prince. And therefore
are they never able to understand or
make any true distinction either of Gods
law, belief, gospel, sacrament, or prayer
to satisfy them selves, or any other in
affliction, but desperately void of all
sweet joys of heavenly comfort and consolation
for ever without regeneration.

The sons 5. Question.
Father you said that no man is able
to keep and fulfil Gods commandment.
Why should God Give such a
law that no man is able to keep, and
yet you say, if that wee do not fulfil
and keep them, we shall all be damned
for ever.

The fathers answer.
My son, (mark what I say, God
that made the law, made it as he is him
self (that is) just, righteous and holy,
and so made he man also at his first creation,
just, righteous and holy. And so
made God Adam like himself, and then
able to keep and perform the whole
law. Therefore man must of force seek
and practise all the means and ways
possible how to fulfil and keep ye same
law in every point and title, which we
may by his grace working in us, be
made able to do in some measure, but
yet not so perfectly, by the entering in
judgment with us, he may justly condemn
us, but he will not have any to
be saved otherwise then by mercy, offered
in his son Christ, and obtained by
faith in him.

The sons 6. question or objection.
How is it possible, because you say
that no man is able to keep and fulfil
it, much less in every point and title.

The fathers answer.
That which man is not able to do, by
reason of his fall, God has so loved us
before Adams fall, that he did provide
for us in his mercy and grace. A man,
even God and man Jesus Christ, his
only son, who came down from heaven,
from God his father, and disdained
not to be enclosed in ye Virgins womb,
and there was made man by the power
of the holy ghost, in all points as we are,
only sin excepted and in our flesh and
nature suffered his passion on ye Cross
for us, and on it suffered the very pains
and torments of hell unto bitter death,
and was buried, by which death and passion,
he has fully accomplished our salvation,
and also fulfilled the whole law
in every point and title, and also appeased
Gods wrath, and vanquished the devil,
hell and damnation, and set open the
gates of heaven for all faithful believers,
and brought us into favour again with
God, his and our faithful father, and is
ascended into heaven where he sits,
and has all power both in heaven and
earth, and there is our daily mediator
unto God, his and our father for us, until
he shall come again to be our joyful
Judge, but yet we must strive and practise
daily to fulfil (to the uttermost of
our power) Gods holy will and commandments.

The sons 7. Question or objection.
How is it possible except you can describe
us some means or way to practiseit, good dear father direct us.

The fathers answer.
By these five steppes or degrees which
if you can keep unto the end, you shall
keep Gods commandments to please
him, although not fulfilled it. for yt Christ
has done already. Which steppes are
these: first to hear the word of God diligently,
reverently, and lovingly. Secondly,
to learn it simply, faithfully & obediently.
Thirdly, to understand it humbly,
spiritually, and truly. Fourthly, to
practise it holily, constantly and righteously.
Fiftly and lastly, to persevere daily,
hourly, and unto our lives end most
triumphantly, and by these five steps or
degrees you may practise to keep the
whole decalogue and will of God.

The sons 8. Question or request.
I pray you describe unto us, the true
sense & meaning of the Law, decalogue
or precept in a brief some or exposition.

The fathers description or exposition.
It is set down by Moses, as he received
it from God in ye Mount Sinai, and
he received it into two Tables, and in
10. verses or precepts it is expressed,
and in the first Table is set down 4.
precepts, and in ye second Table is written
6. precepts, in which first table is set
down our duty toward God, in the 4.
first verses, and in the second table our
duty towards our neighbour, for in the
first table, we are taught in the 4. first
precepts, to have none other Gods but
God only. Secondly, not to reverence
or worship any thing in heaven or earth.
And thirdly, not to abuse Gods holy
name in any exercise. And fourthly, we
are commanded straightly, to remember
to keep holy the Lords day. And in
the second table in the 6. precepts wee
are commanded in the first precept, andfifth commandment, for to honour our
Parents, Princes, and Magistrates.
And the sixth commandment forbids
murder. The 7. forbids adultery,
The 8. forbids theft. The 9. forbids
perjury and false witness against
thy neighbour. And the 10. and last commandment,
forbids covetousness,
extortion, usury, or any thing that shall
prejudice thy neighbour. So that in the
first table practised, is seen our love, holiness,
faith and zeal towards God. Even
so by our endeavour of the second Table
is also seen our love, mercy, faith and
fidelity towards our poor neighbours
and brethren. The sum and fulfilling
of the whole law of God is first to love
God above all things whatsoever, which
is the fulfilling of the four first precepts
of the first Table. And the second is to
love our neighbours & brethren as our
selves, which is the fulfilling of the six
last precepts in the second Table, that is
to live in righteousness all the days of
our life, which power the Lord God
grant us for Christ's sake.

The sons 9. Question.
Because the scripture saith, that no
man by the deeds of the Law can merit
salvation. How then is it possible
to be certain and sure of our salvation,
seeing we are bound to keep the whole
Law.

The fathers answer.
I have said before, that which natural
men cannot do, our Christ which is
both God and man, has by his precious
death and passion fully accomplished, but
yet we must do our endeavour and goodwill
to practise his commandment unto
the uttermost of our power. And therefore
the surest woe for us is to take fast
hold of Christ by a sure & firm fath. &c.

The sons 10. Question.
But what faith is that I pray you describe
unto my mother and us, the true
sense and meaning thereof.

The fathers answer.
It is our belief Apostolical, commonly
called the Creed of the Apostles. As
we say daily. I believe in God. &c. which
Creed or belief, is set down in 12. Articles,
which 12. Articles are divided into
four parts, and in the first part we
confess God our father to be almighty,
and the only maker of heaven & earth,
and in the second part, we do also confess
Jesus Christ to be the only son
of God, and the second person in the trinity,
who being equal with God, his
and our father, came down from heaven
unto us in earth, and here was enclosed
in ye virgins womb, & there was
made man in all points, as we are only
sin excepted, by the power of the holy
ghost, and was borne of the Virgin Mary
in Bethlem, in a stable between an
Ox and an Ass, cradled in a manger,
or Crach, and after he had lived obediently
with his Mother the Virgin, and his
supposed father Joseph at twelve years
of his age, he did dispute with the mighty
doctors in the midst of the Temple
of Jerusalem, and there expounded the
scriptures, and all that heard him wondered
at his gracious speeches, and at the
age of 30. years, was baptised of John
in Jordan, and then went into the wilderness,
and was tempted 3. times of the
devil, and then came to Jerusalem meekly
riding on an Ass, and there was received
of men and children with hosanna,
confessing him king of Israel, and
the son of the highest, and there he
whipped out of the Temple the buyers
and sellers and money changers, and
after he had reproved the Scribes
and Pharisees, and taught the Scripture
(unto his Disciples) he was Judasly
sold unto the Scribes and Pharisees,
mocked, reviled, scourged, buffeted,
condemned of Pilate, crowned with
thorns, crucified on the Cross between
two thieves, and accursed of God his
father, and did suffer on the Cross the
very pains of hell (both in body and
soul) for thee and me, was dead and buried
for thee and me, and the third day
he rose again to justify thee and me.
And after forty days, when he had accomplished
his fathers will, in the sight
of all his Apostles and many other, he
did ascend up into heaven, where he sits,
and there he shall remain until the day
of judgment, where he makes continual
intercession unto God our Father for
thee and me, who has all power both
in heaven and earth to help thee and
me, and will surely come again the last
day in power and glory, and be a joyful
Judge for thee and me. This is the sum
of the second part of our belief: and in
the third part of our belief, we believe
in the holy ghost, & that he is ye third person
in the trinity, equal with the father
and the son, and that he is the virtue
and power of God, proceeding both from
the father and the son, and also the Illuminator
of his elect, yea  the sanctifier
and preserver of all his saints, the
holy Church of God. And in the fourth
part of our belief, wee believe and confess
the communion of saints, to be all
those which believe that Jesus Christ is
the their only mediator and saviour,
which communion of saints we believe
is the universal Church of Christ, dispersed
throughout all the world, commonly
called the Catholic Church, dispersed
here and there upon the face of the
whole earth, of which company Jesus
Christ is the head, (and not the Pope)
which head will not lose one of his elect
for we are as dear unto him, as the  apple
of his eye although we be here condemned,
despised, derided, and tormented
yet our firm faith and belief is, that
our sins are forgiven us, only by our
redeemer and mediator Jesus Christ's
merits, and that our bodies and souls
shall be at the joyful day of judgment
triumphantly with him in heaven, for
ever and ever, and this is the whole
sum of our faith. But this faith is
not mans fantasy or dream, nor the holy
papists formed faith, nor the Atheists
frozen faith, nor yet any evil faith, nor
an heretical faith, but a full and firm
assurance of salvation, grounded and
founded upon the promises made in the
beloved mediator Jesus Christ.

The sons 11. Question.
Is there any that professes any other
faith but this which you have already
described. I pray you good father let
us understand who they be, and what
they are.

The fathers answer.
Yea, there is an Historical faith, which
the devils, Atheists, Epicures, and all belly
Gods have, that is, they do believe
that there is a God, and that the Scriptures
be true, and also fear and tremble,
but they never practise to do his
will, neither yet love they God nor his
holy word, but they love their own
pleasure and bellies more then God,
therefore they shall be saved with the
devils, for their counterfeit, hypocritical
holy and evil life will not serve.
There is also ye Scribes, Pharisees, and
Friars, and Papists formed frozen
faith, which teach men that by their
merits, ceremonies and holy service,
that they shall escape Purgatory, and
deserve heaven. And so they shall as
soon as the Atheist, Epicure, belly
Gods and devils.
There is yet an other sort of people,
that persuade themselves they have a
great faith, and think that they are highly
in Gods favour because they can
make great speech of scripture, and use
great gravity, so that Butter would not
seem to melt in their mouths, before
such as are the principal Preachers,
and will invite them home to their
house, to cloak their holy hypocrisy, but
let a poor professor meet any of these
and salute them, then they will look
so lofty with their eye lids, and speak
so strangely, as though they had never
seen or known them, and yet of their
old familiar acquaintance. But let a
poor man make his moan unto them
of his need, then are they dry, and altogether
without any sap of Christian
love and charity, which shows their
hypocritical faith and infidelity, these
carnal Protestants are all one with usurers
(I will not say) Usurers, I
will not say Leasemongers, Extorcioners,
and proud, profane, miserable,
merciless worldlings.
There is yet a simple sort of Protestants
which think they are very religious,
but they are such as S. Paul
speaks off, which are ever learning,
and yet ignorant asses: and as proud
as Peacocks. All these will run as fast
to heaven, as the Atheists, Epicures, Papists,
and devils, these have faith, but
without repentance of life: it is but
presumption, which will breed in ye end
repentance without faith, which breeds
desperation, from which the Lord
keep us. There is also the Anabaptists,
and the pestilent Famelists faith,
from which horrible sect, good Lord of
his mercy deliver us all.

The sons 12. Question.
How should one attain unto a sure
and constant faith, because you say that
no civil living can please God, without
a sure and constant faith.

The fathers answer.
There is no means or way to attain
unto such a faith but by free grace from
God, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
and that only by daily and faithful prayers
unto God our father for his only
sons sake, and also for his holy spirit,
to instruct and teach us how to pray, &
by none other prayer, but that prayer
which Christ has taught us in his holy
Gospel, which prayer sounds thus.Our father which art in heaven, &c.Our father which art in heaven,

The sons. 13. Question.
I pray you sir, is this prayer to be divided
into parts, as you have done the
commandments and the belief.

The fathers answer.
Yea, for it is divided into. 6. petitions
&. 2. parts, and in the first part is three
petitions, & in the second part is other
three, and the first three petitions excells
the three last, as much as the first
table excells the second, for in the three
first petitions, we crave of God all things
necessary for our souls, in the three
last petitions, we ask of God all things
needful for our bodies, quietness of
mind, and preservation from Satan,
&c. But as touching that preamble
which sounds thus. Our father which
art. &c. That is none of the petitions.Our father which
art.

The sons 14. Question.
What mean you by this word preamble,
is it not one of the. 6. petitions
as the rest are.

The fathers answer.
No, it is no more but a faithful and
reverent presentation of our selves unto
God our father: in which humble &
faithful salutation, we acknowledge
God to be our father and to be in heaven,
but as touching the first petition which
sounds thus, hallowed be thy name,
in this we crave & pray our good father
that we may reverence and with all our
power, honour, sanctify, and keep holy
his name, that is that we abuse not his
name, by swearing by it in vain, neither
profane it in any service or ceremony,
for that is sorcery, although ye
ignorant think they do god good service.
And as touching the. 2. petition which
sounds thus, thy kingdom come. In
this petition we crave of our good father
that his kingdom may dwell with us
and reign with us, which kingdom is
his holy word, & all his heavenly gifts
& graces thereunto belonging, in which
petition we also pray, that God would
give us his holy spirit, and power to
withstand Satan & all his wiles, for ever.
And in the. 3. petition we crave of
our loving father, that we may have
power and grace. to do his holy will in
all our actions, affections and conversations
in this life, even in earth as it is
faithfully done in heaven. In which. 3.
holy petitions, we crave of our good God
all things necessary for our souls. As
in the first table we are taught in the
first four precepts. And in the fourth
petition which sounds thus. Give us
this day our daily bread: In this petition
we crave all things that is necessary
for this life whatsoever. In which
also is concluded all things necessary
for this life, both blessings spiritual
and blessings temporal, and that in any
wise we abuse it not prodigally. And
in the fifth petition, forgive us our offences,
as we do forgive them that offend
us. In which prayer we ask vengeance
of God, if we forgive not one another,
& therein also we show our christian
love and charity one towards an other,
yea our faith and fidelity.hallowed be thy name,thy kingdom come.Give us
this day our daily breadforgive us our offences,
as we do forgive them that offend
us.

Title: A Christian caveat.

The holy Prophet Jeremy in his. 48.
Cha. of his prophecy, has these words,
cursed is he that does the Lords work
negligently, which curse takes hold of
all such that abuse the first table, yea
the second also, but especially the first,
for the first table excells the second,
as much as God excells a man. Therefore
he that breaks the first table, in any
precept, commits sin, direct against
God his creator, and as the first
table teaches us our duty towards god,
ye 2. our duty towards our neighbours, &
brethren. And as ye Lords prayer is divided
into 2. parts, which. 1. part teaches
us to ask allthings necessary for our
souls, and the second part allthings
necessary for this present life, & therefore,
if God has taught us in this first
table, first, to honour & reverence him,
and as Christ has taught us in his

three first petitions, first to ask allthings
necessary for our souls, if then we practise
not first, the contents of the first
table, which is to honour God, & also if
we do not first ask all things necessary
for our souls, as christ has taught us in
ye 3. first petitions, & so practise them first
in all our life and actions that man runs
I say into everlasting curse of
God, because he does the Lords work
negligently, which he ought first to observe
and practise. As for example, God
commands in the first table, first to
honour him, and in the three first petitions,
Christ teaches us first to ask
allthings necessary for our souls: if
then we do not first practise these in all
our life and actions, but seek our own
honour and profit, and fulfil our own
will and pleasure first, then we run
headlong, wilfully, and desperately into
the danger of this damnable curse, because
we neglect the Lords work, will
and commandment, as for daily example
in these days to much practised,
if a man having servants and family,
dare presume to prefer his own
commodity and profit more then the


observation of the Lords day, that man
I say most presumptuously, provokes
the Lords great curse upon him, and
all his house, for if God by his own
mouth commanded to stone to death
that man that gathers but a few
sticks on the Sabbath day, what will
he do (think you) unto those that for
their own pleasure, commodity, and
profit, dare presume to break, violate
and profane, the Lord gods express
holy day, will not he (think you) curse
condemn, and utterly reject all such
wise presumptuous worldly wicked rebels,
such Atheists, Epicures, and belly
gods, whose Kitchen is their Church
and belly their God, & glory everlasting
shame and confusion. Even such (I say)
that provoke their servants to work
and drudge on the Lords day, such
vile Epicures that make their servants
groan under their burdens which they
carry to their vile sodomite and filthy
Gardens of vanity, on the Lords day,
water to water their Gardens, baskets
of victuals, or wine in bottles: and so
spend all the Lords day in gluttony
and drunkenness, which servants wish

rather. 6. week days, then on sunday.
Or in what desperate danger lives ye
devilish wretches, that drudge all the
week, and year, to spend vainly on the
holy days, or else on their own pleasure,
and neither have respect or remember
that which God has commanded
us to remember. Therefore I fear that
king Balthazar trembled not so much
when he saw the hand writing on the
wall, as these prophaners shall tremble
when Christ shall come in judgment
with Jeremy's curse, with ite maledicti
or all these prophaners of the Lords
day, except this curse be their caveat to
repentance.
