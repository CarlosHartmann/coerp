The life of John Picus
Earl of myrandula.
JohanPicus of the father's side descended of
the worthy linage of the emperor Constantine
by a nephew of the said emperor called
Pic9 by whom all the Ancestors of this Johan Picus
undoubtedly bear yt name. But we shall let his
ancestors pass to whom (though they were right
excellent) he gave again as much honour as he received.
and we shall speak of him self rehearsing in
part his learning and his virtue. For these be the
things which we may account for our own of which
every man is more properly to be 9me~ded then of the
nobleness of his ancestors: whose honour makes
us not honourable. for either they were them self virtuous
or not: if not then had they none honour then
self: had they never so great possessions: for honour
is the reward of virtue. And how may they claim
the reward yt properly longs to virtue: if they lack
the virtue yt the reward longs to. Then if themself had none honour how might they leave to their
heirs yt thing which they had not themself. on the
other side if they be virtuous and so consequently honourable /
yet may they not leave their honour to us as
inheritance: no more then the virtue that them self
were honourable for. For never the more noble be we
for their nobleness if ourself lack those things for
which they were noble. But rather the more worshipful
yt our ancestors were the more vile and shameful
be we: if we decline from the steppes of their worshipful
living: the clear beauty of whose virtue makes
the dark spot of our vice the more evidently
to appear & to be the more marked. But Pic9 of whom
we speak was him self so honourable / for the great plentious
abundance of all such virtues: the possession
whereof very honour follows (as a shadow follows
a body) yt he was to all them yt aspire to honour
a very spectacle in whose conditions as in a clear polished
mirror they might behold in what points
very honour stands: whose marvelous cunning
& excellent virtue though my rude learning be fer unable
sufficiently to express: yet for as much as if no man
should do it but he that might sufficiently do it: no
man should do it. and better it were to be unsufficiently
done then utterly undone. I shall therefore as I can
briefly rehearse you his hole life: at the lest wise to
give some other man here after (yt can do it better) occasion
to take hit in hand when hit shall happily
grieve him to see the life of such an excellent cunning
man so fer uncunningly written.

Of his parents and time of
his birth.
IN the year of our lord god .m.cccclxiii. Pic9
the second being then the general vicar
of christ in his church: & Federik the third of yt name
ruling the empire this noble man was born the last
child of his mother Julia. a woman common of a noble
stock. his father hight Johan francis a lord of great
honour and authority.

Of the wonder that appeared before his birth.
A Marvelous sight was there scene before his
birth. there appeared a fiery garland standing
over the chamber of his mother while she travelled
and suddenly vanished a way: which appearance
was peradventure a token that he which should that
hour in the company of mortal men be born: in the
perfection of understanding should be like the perfect
figure of that round circle or garland and that his
excellent name should round about the circle of this
hole world be magnified whose mind should always as
the fire aspire upward to heavenly thing. And whose
fiery eloquence should with an ardent heart in time to
come worship and praise almighty god with all his
strength. And as yt flame suddenly vanished so should
this fire soon from the eyes of mortal people be hidden
we have often times read that such unknown and
strange tokens have gone before or follows the nativities
of excellent wise and virtuous men departing
(as it were and by god's commandment)
severing the cradles of such special children from the
company of other of the common sort. And showing yt
they be born to the achieving of some great thing.
But to pass over other. The great saint ambrose: a
swarm of bees flew about his mouth in his cradle
& some entered in to his mouth and after yt issuing
out again and flying upon high hiding themself
among the clouds escaped both the sight of his
father and of all them that were present which prognostication
one Paulinus making much of: expound
it to signify to us the sweet honeycombs of his
pleasant writing: which should show out the celestial
gifts of god & should lift up the mind of men
from earth in to heaven.
