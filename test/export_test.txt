Title: The glass of the Gospel, or the examination 
of our faith, according to the Articles 
of faith, which contain the 
sum of the Gospel.

Title: Rules.

3. THe measure of our faith is according 
to the measure of the 
power thereof in comfort and sanctification, 
issuing from every article, except 
in the time of temptation. 
2. All the benefits contained in the 
articles of faith, are ours, in &through 
Christ only, when he is ours. 
3. Let us prove our selves therefore 
whether we are in the faith, let us examine 
our selves; know wee not our 
own selves, how that Iesus Christ is in 
us, except we be reprobates. 
4. And if Christ be in us, the body is 
dead because of sin, but the spirit is 
life for righteousness sake. 
5. For the Kingdom of God is not in 
word but in power.

6. We must therefore show our faith 
out of our works: for as the body 

without the spirit is dead, , even so faith 
without works is dead. Jam. 2. 18. 20. 
26. 


Title: 1. Article. 
I believe in God]

3. This is my faith, that though by 
nature thorough Adam, I &the whole 
Church are Apostates from God, and 
enemies to him &his law, yet by grace 
thorough the second Adam Iesus Christ, 
God is our God, and we his people reconciled 
unto him, to serve him in newness 
of life all our days. 
2. This is my comfort hereof, that 
God is my God, and has sealed me 
for himself, and therefore I am most 
blessed, being in such a case. Psalm. 144. 
15. 
3. This gives me further assurance 
that this my faith is sound, because together 
with this comfort, he has given 
me since I believed in his name a heart 
desirous to depart from all iniquity. 2. 
Tim. 2. 29. 

Title: Father]


3. This is my faith, that though I was 
a child of wrath, yet by grace in Christ 
I am the child of God, and God my 
loving father. 
2. This comfort I receive hereof, that 
I being thus his child shall lack nothing, 
because my heavenly father 
does tender me much more, then any 
earthly father his child. Essay. 46. 15. 
16. 
3. This is my assurance, that my faith 
herein is sincere, because together 
with this comfort, I feel my self affectioned 
to reverence, love and obey 
him as my most dear father, and am 
enabled by his spirit to run to him 
with boldness in all my wants, crying Abba, oh my father. Room. 8. 15. 

Title: Almighty]
 

This is my faith, that 
though I be weak and unable to resist 
my enemies bodily or spiritual, no 
way able to help or provide for my 
self, yet my heavenly father is of all 
majesty and power, guiding continually 

men, Angels, devils, and all creatures 
to serve for his own glory, and 
the good of his children. 
2. This comfort I receive hereof, 
that he does &will continually make 
all things work together for the best 
unto me, not only the holy means 
appointed thereunto, but also mine 
afflictions, yea my greatest enemies. 
Sins and Satan himself, until I be 
perfected in the Heavens. Gen. 50. 
20. 
3. This also does further assure me, 
that he thus works for me: because he 
has first showed the same mighty power, 
quickening and raising me up 
from the death of sin, which he showed 
in raising my Saviour from the 
grave, and secondly for that I have 
sensibly felt all things thus working 
together for my salvation. 

Title: Maker of heaven and earth]
 

3. This is my faith, that though 
through Adam I had lost the right, 

both of heaven and earth, and of every 
creature, so as I could have no comfort 
in the use of them, but terror as an usurper, 
being cast forth off the earthly 
paradise, left as an heir of the curse, 
yet thorough my Saviour the second 
Adam, since I truly believed in him, I 
am restored to a far better estate, being 
made in him a right heir of all, 
never to be cast forth off my inheritance 
any more. 
2. This comfort I receive hereof, 
that heaven is mine and all the joys 
thereof, and that I am set already in 
the heavenly places in Christ my head, 
who reserves the full fruition for me. 
And secondly that all the creatures in 
heaven and in earth be they good or 
bade, are at a league with me, to help 
for my good, so far as may stand with 
his glory, my salvation and the good 
of his Church. Hos. 2. 18. 
3. This is also my assurance, that 
my faith is sincere herein, because that 
together with this comfort, I both 

perceive all the creatures thus ready to 
help me, especially in time of trial 
when ordinary means fail: and also 
feel a holy care wrought in me to 
use the creatures aright, sanctifying 
them by the word and prayer, and that 
my affections are set on heavenly 
things. 

Title: 2. Article. 
And in Iesus]
 

3. This is my faith, that though I am 
guilty of innumerable sins both original 
and actual, even the breach 
of the whole law, and every part thereof, 
and so am worthy to be damned, 
and have all the plagues of God due 
to my sin cast upon me, yea though 
I was a bond slave to sin and Satan, 
yet I believe that Iesus is my Saviour, 
&has deliuered me from all my sins, 
both the guilt, &satisfactory punishment 
of them, as also from the power 
of sin and Satan. Room. 6. 12. 
14. 

2. This faith is my comfort, and 
moreover that all my sins and enemies 
shall not hinder my salvation. 
Room. 8. 39. 
3. This is also for my full assurance 
thereof, because besides that I feel my 
soul rejoicing in God my Saviour, &
I perceive my self also deliuered from 
the tyranny of Satan, and power of 
sin, even of those sins which before 
led me captive, so that no sin 
has any more dominion over me, 
that I do serve it in the lusts thereof, 
and for that I am withal deliuered 
from the terrors of conscience for my 
sin. 

Title: Christ.
 

3. This is my faith, that though I 
was in the kingdom of darkness &
a stranger from God by my sin, yet 
Christ was anointed for me with all 
the gifts of the spirit to be my mediator, 
my King. 
my Priest. 
my Prophet. Mat. 23. 10. Act. 3 22. 23.

2. This is my comfort, that he being my 
king, has and will fully deliuer me 
from the kingdom of Satan, &give 
unto me his heavenly kingdom. Secondly 
being my Priest, has first reconciled 
me to his father; by the sacrifice 
of himself, and keeps me since in 
favour, by his perpetual intercession. 
Thirdly being my Prophet, will proceed 
to teach me all the will of his father 
necessary to eternal life. 
3. This is for my assurance hereof, 
because I feel my self to have received 
of the anointing of every one of 
these from Christ &the fruit of them. 
3. of his kingdom, enabling me to begin 
not only to subdue my sins &
evil affections, but also to rule so far 
over my self, as to bring my very 
thoughts and all committed unto me 
into some obedience to Christ. 2. Of 
his Priesthood whereby I am made 
able to offer to the Lord my self, supplications, 
thanks and works of mercy, 
with all that I have to serve him. 

3. Of his Prophesy, making me to 
grow in the knowledge of himself, 
and in care to instruct others therein. 

Title: His only son]
 

3. This is my faith, that he beeing 
the only son of the Father by nature, 
has made me a child and heir 
by the grace of adoption, who was by 
nature a child of wrath and perdition. 
2. This comfort I find herein, that 
to me belongs the inheritance of Gods 
sons. Gal. 47. Room. 8. 17. 
3. This also is for my assurance, for 
that he has sent the spirit of his son 
into my heart, whereby I can call 
him father with comfort, which is my 
witness and seal. Romans. 8 16. 2. 
Cor 1. 22. 

Title: Our Lord]
 

3. This is my faith, that though I 
was under the Prince of darkness, 
having Satan my Lord, until I believed 

in Christ, yet since I am Christs 
and he is my only Lord 
By 3. Purchase with his blood. 
By 2. Gift from his father. 
By 3. marriage contracted to be 
consummate at his appearing. 
2. This is my comfort, that being 
thus purchased and given to him as a 
peculiar gift, I shall never perish, and 
being thus contracted to Christ my 
Lord, the bond thereof is in such faithfulness, 
as shall never be dissolved, until 
I be brought into the bride-chamber, 
and fully glorified. 
3. This increases my assurance, 
for that together with this comfort, 
I feel my self redeemed from the 
earth: viz. my earthly conversation, &
do delight to hear the voice of my 
bridegroom. 

Title: 3. Article. 
Which was conceived by the holy Ghost, 
borne of the virgin Mary]
 

3. This is my faith: that though I 
was conceived in sin, and borne in 

iniquity, and so corrupted in all the 
parts both of my soul and body, yet 
that both the conception, birth and 
whole nature of Christ my Saviour, 
was fully sanctified by being united to 
his Godhood, to be imputed unto 
me. 
2. This is my comfort, that my God 
has given me this holiness of his son, 
as a robe to cover all my sinfulness, and 
whereby I do both presently, and shall 
ever stand most gloriously in Gods 
sight, chiefly at the great day. 
3. This is my further assurance 
hereof, because I can morn for this 
total corruption in me, and being 
humbled in the sense of it, am driven 
daily to put on Christ by faith: and 
for that I feel also the new birth in 
me, by a change begun in all the powers 
both of my body and soul, 
wrought by virtue hereof, since I was 
conceived and borne in the Church, 
by the power of the holy Ghost. 

Title: 4. Article. 
Suffered under Pontius Pilate: was crucified]
 

3. This is my faith, that besides all the 
evils which my Saviour endured for me, in all the course of his life, he also endured that most 
death which I had deserved, 
to satisfy his fathers justice for me, &
to pacify his wrath towards me. 
2. This is my comfort hence, that I 
am deliuered from the curse of the 
law, he beeing thus accursed for me, 
&that whatsoever sufferings I endure 
in this life, are sanctified hereby to be 
to me 
Fatherly 3. Exercises. 
Fatherly 2. Chastisements. 
Fatherly 3. Trials. 
Fatherly 4. Fulfilling of Christs afflictions. 
Fatherly 5. Means to confirm me 
to Christ my head, 
6. Examples to others. 
3.This also warrants the soundness 

of my faith herein. 3. Because I feel 
my self to profit in Christianity by 
my afflictions and crosses. 2. I desire 
to take pleasure in such sufferings for 
Christs sake. 3. Because the old man in 
me begins to be crucified with 
Christ. Gal. 2. 19. 5. 24. 

Title: Dead.]
 

3. This is my faith, that Christ has 
died for my sin and by dying has overcome 
death, and so taken away the 
sting thereof, that it cannot hurt any of 
those that believe in him. 
2. This comfort I find hereupon, 
that death shall be so far off from hurting 
me, that it is already sanctified by 
this death of my Saviour, to be to me 
the gate of life. 
3. This also increases my assurance 
that my faith is sound herein, because 
I find together with this comfort, 
that every sin has received his 
deaths wound in me (each beginning 
to die) and for that I feel a power by 

Christs death, to triumph against the 
terrors of death, waiting for it, when I 
have finished my course, wishing to 
be dissolved and to be with Christ. 
Room. 7. 24. 

Title: And buried]
 

3. This is my faith, that Christ was 
buried for me, both to assure me of the 
certainty of his death for me, and that 
all my sins are buried in his grave, 
yea withal to bury sin in me, and 
to sanctify my grave to be a sweet 
bed for my body to rest in until the 
resurrection. 
2. This very faith is my joy, and 
moreover that my sins thus buried 
shall never come into remembrance to 
accuse or condemn me, or to hinder 
Gods everlasting mercy &love from 
me. 
3. This also furthers my assurance, 
for that together with this joy, I feel 
many sins buried in me, and consuming 
daily by the virtue of this death 

and burial of my Saviour, especially, 
the strength and delight I took in every 
sin. 

Title: He descended into hell]
 

3. This is my faith, that Christ suffered 
not only in his body the punishment 
due to my body, but in his soul 
also the torment due to my soul, which 
I should have endured for evermore, 
and that not only upon the cross, 
but also in the garden, as appears by 
his speeches, his prayers, his cry, his agony, 
and bloody sweat, and so has 
for me triumphed over hell. 
2. This is my comfort, that though 
I stood ever in danger of eternal death 
for all my sins, yet now by my Saviour 
I am deliuered from the terrors 
thereof. Heb 2. 15. 
3. This is further for my assurance 
hereof, for that I have received comfort 
in this only, even then when the 
pains of hell have gotten hold upon 
me for my sins; and because I feel 

a desire to save others also from that 
place of torment by leading them to 
this my Saviour, and have now entered 
the narrow way to heaven following 
my Saviour therein, having left the 
broad way going to destruction. 

Title: 5. Article.
The third day he rose again from the
dead]
 
3. This is my faith, that my Saviour 
has fully satisfied the justice of his father 
for my sin, even to the uttermost 
farthing, in that he rose again, because 
any one sin of his elect not satisfied 
for had kept him in death, seeing 
he took upon him to become surety 
for them all. 
2. This is my joy, that thorough 
him I am justified and stand as righteous 
in the sight of my God, all my sins 
being utterly done away, and covered 
hereby. 
3. This helps my assurance hereof, 

for that besides this comfort, I feel 
my self also raised up to a desire of a 
perfect holiness. Apo-20. 5. 6. 

Title: 6. Article. 
He ascended into heaven]
 

3. This is my faith, that when my 
Saviour had fulfilled all things in the 
earth for the redeeming of his church, 
he went up into heaven, both to 
prepare the way, and also to take 
possession and to keep it for me. 
Ioh. 14 2. 
2. This is my joy, that none can hinder 
me from thence, but where my 
Saviour and head is, there shall I be 
also. 
This ratifies my assurance, for that 
my affections are already ascended, 
beeing set on things that are above. 
Col. 3. 2. 

Title: And sits on the right hand of God the 
father almighty]
 
3. This is my faith, that my Saviour 
has all power given him over all 
sorts, to give eternal life to whom he 
will, and condemn the rest, sits as

King at the right hand of his Father, 
filling his Church with his gifts, guiding 
it by his word and spirit, until he 
have glorified it, and subdued all his 
enemies, convincing them by the light 
of Nature works, 
3.creatures. 
2.judgments. 
3.mercies.
of his word. 
2. This is my comfort, that he will 
guide me by his word &spirit continually: 
&overrule whatsoever Satan 
or the wicked can do against me, to 
serve for my good, &against themselves. 
3. This is also for my further assurance 
herein, because I feel my self 
desirous to be guided by the direction 
of his holy spirit speaking in the 
word: and moreover, I hear a voice 
behind me saying; This is the way, 
walk in it, when I turn to the right 
hand or to the left. 

Title: 7. Article.
From thence he shall come, to .]
3. This is my faith, that my Saviour 
shall come to be the judge of the whole 
world, to judge every one according 
to their works. 
2. This is my joy, that though I did, 
and do naturally quake, so oft as I 
hear or think of the terrible judgment, 
yet remembering the judge, who 
has by himself satisfied for all my 
sins, so taking them on himself, 
and given me his own absolute righteousness. 
I can cry; Come Lord Iesus, 
come quickly, since he shall come 
to me a most happy Saviour, and not 
an angry judge. 
3. This is also for the accomplishment 
of my assurance, that this my faith is 
sincere, because besides this comfort, I 
labour always to have a clear conscience, 
that I may have boldness at that 
day, and can persuade men, knowing 

The terror of the Lord. 

Title: 8. Article.
I believe in the holy Ghost]

3. This is my faith, that the holy 
Ghost is God, the third person in Trinity, 
sanctifier and preseruer of his 
Church, knitting the whole church to 
Christ the head thereof, &every member 
one to another. 
2. This is my comfort, that he will 
perfect in me this good work of sanctification 
until the appearing of Iesus Christ, 
having already so knit me 
to Christ my head, as I can never be 
separated. 
3. This assures my heart, because I 
have already received the first fruits 
of this blessed Spirit, whereby I am enabled 
to sigh, weighting for the perfect 
adoption, and to pray with groans, 
striving against that corruption in me 
therefore it is to me as the seal and 
earnest of my inheritance against the  
day of glory. 2. Cor. 1 .22.

Title: 9. Article.
The holy catholic Church.]

Title: The holy catholic Church.]
3. This is my faith, that God has 
always a chosen flock, not only of 
those who triumph already in the 
heavens, but even militant here in the 
earth, universally scattered, all which 
he has ordained to eternal life, by 
his son Iesus Christ, to whom all his 
promises appertain, having these 
principal marks, a cheerful submission 
to the word and sacraments outwardly, 
and holy affections inwardly 
according to the same, proceeding 
from this holy faith: though the number 
of them have been very small in 
the most flourishing ages of the church, 
and those ordinarily of the baser sort, 
and shall scant be found when Christ 
shall come. 
2. This is my comfort, that GOD 
has vouchsafed me to be one of 

that little flock. Luc. 12. 32. 
3. This assures me further hereof, 
because I feel in my self a hungering 
after the word and Sacraments, as my 
spiritual nourishment, and can willingly 
submit my self to be guided by 
the same word, for the perfecting this 
work of grace begun in me. 

Title: The communion of Saints.]
 
2. This is my faith, that this whole 
Church has a communion or fellowship 
together in Christ &all his benefits, 
&so in every article of this faith, 
as in the same Saviour, Father, preseruer 
&sanctifier: and also amongst 
themselves, being affected alike both 
inwardly in love, hatred, joy, grief, 
that is, to love the same things, and 
for the same: and outwardly in relieving, 
helping, and caring for one another. 
2. This rejoices my soul, that the 
Lord has vouchsafed me to be of 
this blessed communion. 

3. This further assures me hereof, 
because together with this comfort, I 
am so affected to all the true servants 
of God, thus soundly professing the 
Gospel, that I can pray heartily for 
them, morn and rejoice with them, 
and for them, as for my brethren and 
sisters, and be ready to help them in 
whatsoever, esteeming of them as 
members of Christ with me, and can 
claim the word as my portion and 
heritage for ever. Psalm, 119. 111. 

Title: 10. Article.
The forgiveness of sins

3. This is my faith, that all this 
whole church &every member thereof, 
have all their sins forgiuen for 
Christ, being all washed in his blood. 
2. This comfort I find hereof, that 
howsoever I am a miserable sinner 
many ways, yet none of all my sins 
shall ever be imputed unto me, being 
of this holy Communion. Room. 8, 33. 

3. This is also for my assurance, because 
I can oft morn bitterly, when 
I look at my Saviour, whom by my 
sins I have crucified, and do abhor 
them as none of mine, but fruits of that 
sin that still dwells in me in part, 
and moreover because I can forgive 
and pray even for my very enemies, &
have set my self to wage continual 
war against every sin. 

Title: 11. Article. 
The resurrection of the body].
3. This is my faith, that all bodies 
shall rise again at the last day, when 
Christ comes, the bodies of all the faithful 
to eternal joy by the resurrection 
of Iesus Christ, though all the rest to 
condemnation. 
2. This is my comfort, that this my 
body now subiect to diverse infirmities, 
as sickness, manifold pains and 
sorrows, &c shall then arise a glorious 
body like the shining body of 

Iesus Christ, free from any more misery, 
pain, or labour, all tears beeing 
wiped away from mine eyes. 
3. This is also my further assurance 
hereof, because I feel in my self the 
first resurrection, by a daily rising in 
my inner man, to newness of life. Apoc. 
20. 6. 

Title: 12. Article. 
The life everlasting]
3. This is my faith; that in steed of 
this transitory life, so full of labours 
and griefs, God has provided for all 
this holy church a most happy and 
blessed life, which shall continue 
for evermore. Apo. 21. 22. &22. 1. 2. 
3. 4. 5. 
2. This joy I find herein, that 
though my life be full of crosses and 
troubles, every day subiect to a thousand 
temptations, and very momentany, 
yet then it shall be a most glorious 
life, when I shall dwell in Paradise in 

the presence of God, and all his blessed 
Saints and Angels for evermore. 
1. These. 1. 9. 10. 
3. This finally confirms my assurance 
hereof, because I feel the life 
of grace begun in me already, 
which is the beginning of this eternal 
life (but that then it shall be far more 
holy and glorious, and every way 
more blessed then the heart of man 
can conceive,) and moreover for that 
he has given me this grace to believe 
in the son: I therefore know by the 
testimony of my Saviour, that I have 
eternal life; and withal he has given 
me a heart to hear his voice with delight, 
so that I shall never perish: yea 
my faith herein is such, that I account 
all things but loss and dung, in respect 
of Christ Iesus my Saviour, and all 
the troubles of this life, not worthy 
the glory, that shall be then revealed 
unto me, &so strive hard forward towards 
this mark, labouring always 
to keep a good conscience, both toward 

God &man; that I may ever be prepared 
for the full fruition hereof, &counted 
worthy to enter through the gates 
into the City. Apoc. 22. 14. This is the victory that overcomes 
the world, even our faith. 1.Ioh. 5. 4 Be thou faithful unto the death, and I 
will give thee the crown of life. Apoc. 2. 
10. Here is the patience of Saints, here 
are they which keep the commandments 
of God, and the faith of Iesus. Apoc. 14. 
12. I have sworn and will perform it, 
that I will keep thy righteous judgements

always. Psalm. 119. 160. Then shall I not be confounded, when I 
have respect to all thy commandments.
Psalm. 119. 6. 
Lord increase my faith. Luke. 17. 5. 
Mat. 9. 24. 

Title: The benefits of this practise of examination 
to encourage us unto it, since it is 
wearisome and unpleasant to 
flesh and blood.

3. Performing it aright, wee shall avoid 
all hardness of heart, lukewarmness, 
sleeping in any sin, and prevent 
an evil conscience, with many other 
punishments of sin, and withal we 
shall be able to recover our selves forth 
with, out of every gross sin, and 
from Satans power, yea even from 
the gulf of deepest despair. Psalm. 
32. 4. 5. 
2. We shall daily be putting off the 
old man, and putting on the new: 
strip us off the rags of our sins, 
and put on our wedding garment, to 
make us still more glorious in the eyes 
of our bridegroom: yea we shall caste 
away the works of darkness and 
put upon us the armour of light. 
3. Being thus armed, wee shall be so 

enabled to watch continually, and defend 
our selves against Satan, and all 
his power, that he shall never give us 
any deadly wounds, but we shall put 
him to flight, and in time trample him 
utterly under our feet. 
4. We shall be able to see the good 
way and wherein the perfection of a 
Christian consists, with his true glory 
and felicity in this life, and to rejoice 
in them that are such: and withal to 
behold the fearful state of the world, 
to morn for it with just Lot: so to 
judge aright between the godly and 
the wicked, and specially to judge for 
our own estate. 
5. We shall be fitted in some measure 
according to our place and calling 
as wee are Christians, to teach, 
convince, admonish, reprove, exhort 
and comfort both our selves and 
others. 
6. We shall be enabled to pray for 
our selves and others, with the whole 
Church of God, according to our several 

necessities, and after the will of 
God in faith, and withal to make a 
most sound confession of our sins 
general or particular, with feeling, and 
so most sweet thanksgiving for all 
mercies, with a like comfortable profession 
of our faith. 
7.We shall so grow in Christ, and 
repair his image, as by beholding &
observing our selves, we shall get most 
strong consolation, that wee are true 
branches of that holy vine, lively members 
of Christs body, the very sheep 
of his fold, to stand at his right hand, 
and hence most certain assurance of 
eternal life sealed unto us by his holy 
Spirit, having in the mean time 
all the promises of this life, and that 
to come, all being ours and for us. 
8. Seeing our growth in grace, perceiving 
what sins wee have overcome, 
and what graces we have obtained, 
we shall be encouraged to strive 
forward to perfection, until wee obtain 
the end of our strife, the crown 

of glory. Apoc. 2. 9. 10. 
9. Wee shall shine as stars in the 
world, to the greater glory of our god. 
the comfort and good example of 
Gods servants, the conversion of the 
wicked, or stopping their mouths, 
and leaving them more without excuse. 
10. We shall increase the brightness 
of our glory in heaven, as wee have 
more glorified God in the earth: for 
the practise of this examination in the 
course of our life, is a spiritual sowing, 
whereof wee shall in due time reap 
a plentiful harvest, if wee fail not. 
Gal. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 
11. Wee shall be sure to get and 
keep a good conscience, whereof such 
peace, boldness, security, and heavenly 
joy will follow in us, as passes 
all understanding, and no carnal man 
can possibly feel, but only those 
for whom the kingdom is prepared, 
because it is the beginning of it 
in this world. 

12. Briefly, which is the sum of 
all, we shall get this assurance that Iesus 
Christ is our Saviour anointed for 
us, our King. 
our Priest. 
our Prophet. 
having made us also Kings and priests, 
to our God for evermore. 

Title: Some necessary questions appertaining
hereunto.
3. Of senselessness in sin.

Quest. Can any man living without 
feeling of his sin, and misery by it, 
or of his spiritual poverty, have any 
sound hope of his salvation by Christ?And. No. Christ is a physician only 
to them that are sick, a deliuerer to 
them who feel themselves in prison, 
calls them only that travel, and are 
ready to faint under the burden of 
their sins.

Title: Of obstinacy in sin.

Q. Can any who continue stubbornly 
in any one sin, not submitting 
themselves to be ruled by the 
word of Christ and his ministers, in all 
things, hope for eternal life by Christ, 
or the  favour of God?
A. No, they that come to Christ must 
follow him forsaking themselves, taking 
up their cross daily, and learn 
of him to bear his yoke: if ever they 
will find rest unto their souls, they 
must hear his voice, or else they shall 
be destroyed from among his people. 
For they that despise Christs messengers, 
refusing to hear them, despise 
him: and all that boast of faith, must 
show their faith by their works, to be 
a living faith, else it shall no more profit 
them then the faith of the devils, 
yea all must follow holiness without 
which no man shall ever see God with 
comfort. Heb. 12. 14.

Title: 3. To whom sound comfort 
belongs.

Q. Can any but they who endeavour 
to walk with GOD in holiness all 
their days, have any comfort that they 
shall be heard in their distress, or can 
they pray?
A. No, for the justice of God will 
not admit it: for he that turns away 
his ear from hearing the law, his prayer 
is abominable, and what marvel 
is it, if God call to us, and wee will not 
hear to obey him, though he hear 
not us, when wee call and cry to him. 
Therefore we must hold the prophets 
rule for certain. That if wee but 
incline unto wickedness in our hearts, 
God will not hear us.

Title: Experiment general.

Try whether wee can find any 
sound comfort in our prayers, that God 
will hear us in the day of our affliction 
or any time of need, or that any 
one of the promises of GOD belong 
to us, or so much as believe any 

article or faith with comfort, until 
we have soundly repented of all our 
sins, our known sins particularly, 
unknown generally, with a full resolution 
to know the Lord, and fear 
him, walking in all his commandments 
for ever. 


Title: 4. Quest. Of the causes of 
backsliding.

Quest. Since sin has such fearful 
effects, and men void of feeling 
of their sin, are in so dangerous 
a case, how come a number, 
who have had some good feeling, to 
such coldness in religion, hardness of 
heart and senselessness in sin, as 
to make no conscience almost of any 
sin?And. 3. By neglecting the means 
of the preservation of grace, as of ordinary 
hearing, reading of the Scriptures 
and other good books prayer, 
meditation, conference, examination, 

fasting, and the like, or doing these 
things for a fashion only, without reverence, 
or at least not waiting, for the 
fruit of them. 
2. By committing some gross sin, 
or living in some known sin without 
repentance, as David, or for not glorifying

god according to our knowledge 
of him, in practising all holy duties 
which he requires, or at least, not receiving 
the love of the truth. 2. These. 2 
10. 11. 12. 
3. By overmuch greediness in seeking 
earthly things, whether our pleasures, 
profits, ease or credit, which 
steal away our hearts and choke 
grace; or seeking them more then Gods 
glory and his savour, with the things 
concern his kingdom, or with the 
neglect hereof, and of the salvation of 
our brethren. For our love cannot be 
in the highest degree, to two contrary 
masters: but as it increases towards 
one it decreases towards the other. 
neither will our jealous God part our 

love with the world, for either he 
will be loved with all the heart, and 
with all the soul, and above all earthly 
things, or not at all. 
4. By familiarity with the enemies 
of Gods religion, or men notoriously 
profane, or luke-warm professors 
for it is the just judgment of God to 
lead us into temptation hereby, so giving 
us up for these sins.


Title: Some special preservatives against 
every sin.

3. That wee be resolute to choose 
rather to endure any misery, then to 
sin against God. as Joseph, Daniel, 
and the three children. 
2. That wee consider the heinousness 
of the least sin, that it is against 
Gods infinite majesty, and 
Christs blood, deserving the eternal 
curse of God; and more by the fearful 
punishment of the sin of the angels, 
of Adam, Moses, Vzzah, Saul, 

and chiefly, that upon the son of 
God himself, so to accustom our 
selves to subdue the very least sins. 
3.That wee warily resist the 
first motions to any sin, and 
be careful avoid every occasion 
thereof, as we do of infectious diseases. 
Gen. 39. 10. 
4. That we live always as in Gods 
presence who may take us away on a 
sudden, remembering also our appearance 
before him. Acts. 24. 15. 16. 
5. That wee keep continually a fresh remembrance of Gods great 
goodness, especially his chiefest mercies 
bodily, and spiritual, ordinary, 
and extraordinary, to say always as 
Joseph, how can I do this, and sin against 
my good God? Neh. 6. 11. 13. 
6. That we be walking ever painfully 
in our special calling with God. 
7. That we keep withal a perpetual 
memory of the former misery of 
sin, and blessings of righteousness. 
8. That above all wee use fervent 

prayer upon all occasions to be kept 
by these preservatives. 1. These. 5. 17. 
Eph. 6. 18. 

Means to keep always a tender 
conscience.
3. This practise of considering our 
ways. Psalm. 119. 59. 
2. Careful using all the means of 
grace, neglecting no one. 
3. Avoiding presumptions, or gross 
sins. 
4. Companying familiarly only 
with the godly, avoiding the contrary 
so far, as is possible. 
5. Watching against worldly cares, 
that they steal not away our hearts. 
Mat. 6. 24. &13. 22. Luck 21. 34. This is the generation of them that 
seek him, of them that seek thy face, this 
is Jacob. Psa. 24. 6. The way of the righteous shines as the 
light that shines more and more unto 
the perfect day. Pro. 4. 18. 19. 

The loving kindness of the Lord endures 
for ever and ever upon them 
that fear him, and his righteousness 
upon children's children. Unto them 
that keep his covenant, and think upon 
his commandments, to do them.  Psalm. 
103. 17. 18. 
FINIS.
