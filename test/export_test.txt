Title: The life of John Picus
Earl of myrandula.
Johan Picus of the father's side descended of
the worthy linage of the emperor Constantine
by a nephew of the said emperor called
Pic9 by whom all the Ancestors of this Johan Picus
undoubtedly bear yt name. But we shall let his
ancestors pass to whom (though they were right
excellent) he gave again as much honour as he received.
and we shall speak of him self rehearsing in
part his learning and his virtue. For these be the
things which we may account for our own of which
every man is more properly to be 9me~ded then of the
nobleness of his ancestors: whose honour makes
us not honourable. for either they were them self virtuous
or not: if not then had they none honour then
self: had they never so great possessions: for honour
is the reward of virtue. And how may they claim
the reward yt properly longs to virtue: if they lack
the virtue yt the reward longs to. Then if themself had none honour how might they leave to their
heirs yt thing which they had not themself. on the
other side if they be virtuous and so consequently honourable /
yet may they not leave their honour to us as
inheritance: no more then the virtue that them self
were honourable for. For never the more noble be we
for their nobleness if ourself lack those things for
which they were noble. But rather the more worshipful
yt our ancestors were the more vile and shameful
be we: if we decline from the steppes of their worshipful
living: the clear beauty of whose virtue makes
the dark spot of our vice the more evidently
to appear & to be the more marked. But Pic9 of whom
we speak was him self so honourable / for the great plentious
abundance of all such virtues: the possession
whereof very honour follows (as a shadow follows
a body) yt he was to all them yt aspire to honour
a very spectacle in whose conditions as in a clear polished
mirror they might behold in what points
very honour stands: whose marvelous cunning
& excellent virtue though my rude learning be fer unable
sufficiently to express: yet for as much as if no man
should do it but he that might sufficiently do it: no
man should do it. and better it were to be unsufficiently
done then utterly undone. I shall therefore as I can
briefly rehearse you his hole life: at the lest wise to
give some other man here after (yt can do it better) occasion
to take hit in hand when hit shall happily
grieve him to see the life of such an excellent cunning
man so fer uncunningly written.

Title: Of his parents and time of
his birth.
IN the year of our lord god .m.cccclxiii. Pic9
the second being then the general vicar
of christ in his church: & Federik the third of yt name
ruling the empire this noble man was born the last
child of his mother Julia. a woman common of a noble
stock. his father hight Johan francis a lord of great
honour and authority.

Title: Of the wonder that appeared before his birth.
A Marvelous sight was there scene before his
birth. there appeared a fiery garland standing
over the chamber of his mother while she travelled
and suddenly vanished a way: which appearance
was peradventure a token that he which should that
hour in the company of mortal men be born: in the
perfection of understanding should be like the perfect
figure of that round circle or garland and that his
excellent name should round about the circle of this
hole world be magnified whose mind should always as
the fire aspire upward to heavenly thing. And whose
fiery eloquence should with an ardent heart in time to
come worship and praise almighty god with all his
strength. And as yt flame suddenly vanished so should
this fire soon from the eyes of mortal people be hidden
we have often times read that such unknown and
strange tokens have gone before or follows the nativities
of excellent wise and virtuous men departing
(as it were and by god's commandment)
severing the cradles of such special children from the
company of other of the common sort. And showing yt
they be born to the achieving of some great thing.
But to pass over other. The great saint ambrose: a
swarm of bees flew about his mouth in his cradle
& some entered in to his mouth and after yt issuingout again and flying upon high hiding themself
among the clouds escaped both the sight of his
father and of all them that were present which prognostication
one Paulinus making much of: expound
it to signify to us the sweet honeycombs of his
pleasant writing: which should show out the celestial
gifts of god & should lift up the mind of men
from earth in to heaven.

Title: Of his person
He was of feature & shape seemely & beauteous /
of stature goodly and high: of flesh tender
and soft / his visage lovely and fair / his colour
white entangled with comely reddish / his eyes gray
and quick of like / his teeth white and even / his hair
yellow and not to piked.

Title: Of his setting forth to school
and study in humanity.
Under the rule and governance of his mother
he was set to masters & to learning: where
with so ardent mind he laboured the studies of humanity
that with in short while he was (and not with
out a cause) accounted among the chief orators
and poetic of that time in learning marvelously
swift and of so ready a wit that the verses which he
heard ones read: he would again both forward and
backward to the great wonder of the hearers rehearse.
and over that would hold it in sure remembrance
which in other folks wont commonly to happen contrary.
for they yt are swift in thinking be often times
slow in remembering. and they yt with more labour
& difficult receive it: more fast & surely hold it.

Title: Of his study in Canone
IN the fourteen year of his age by the commandment
of his mother (which longed very
sore to have him priest) he departed to bolognia to
study in the laws of the church: which when he had
two year tasted perceiving that the faculty leaned
to no thing but only mere traditions & ordinances:
his mind fill from it. yet lost he not his time
there in for in that two year yet being a child he compiled
a breviary or a summary upon all the decretals
in which as briefly as possible was he comprised
the effect of all yt whole great volume and made a book
no slender thing to right cunning & perfect doctors.

Title: Of his study in philosophy & divinity.
After this as a desirous sercher of the secretes
of nature he left these common trodden
paths and gave him self whole to speculation & philosophy
as well human as divine. For the purchasing
whereof (after the manner of Plato and Apollonius)
he scrupulously sought out / all the famous doctors
of his time. visiting studiously all the universities
and schools not only through Italy but also
thorough france. And so infatigable labour gave he
to those studies: that yet a child and beardless he was
both reputed: and was in deed both a perfect philosopher
and a perfect divine.

Title: Of his mind and vainglorious disposition
at Rome.
NOw had he been .vii. year 9uersaunte in these
studies when full of pride & desirous of glory
and man praise (for yet was he not kindled in ye
love of god) he went to rome & there (coveting to
make a show of his cunning & little considering how
great envy he should raise against him self) ix.C. questions
he purposed. of diverse and sundry matters.
as well in logic and philosophy as divinity. with
great study piked and sought out as well of the latin
actors as the greeks. And partly set out of the secret
mysteries of the hebrews / Caldaies / & Arabs.
and many things drawn out of ye old obscure philosophy
of Pythagoras / trimegistus / and orpheus9 / &
many other things strange: and to all folk (except
right few special excellent men) before that day:
not unknown only: but also unheard. of all which questions
in open places (that they might be to all people
ye better known) he fastened and set up. offering
also himself to bear the costs of all such as would
come thither out of far countries to dispute / but
thorough ye envy of his malicious enemies (which
envy like ye fire ever draws to ye highest) he could
never bring about to have a day to his disposition
appointed. For this cause he tarried at Rome an
whole year in all which time his enviours never durst
openly with open disposition attempt him but rather
with craft and slight and as it were with privy
trenches enforced to undermine him for non
other cause but for malice and for they were (as many
men thought) corrupt with a pestilent envy.
This envy as men denied was specially raised a
against him for this cause that were there where many
which had many years: some for glory: some for
covetuousness: given them self to learning: they thought
that it should happily deface their fame & diminish
the opinion of their cunning if so young a man plenteous
of substance and great doctrine: durst in the
chief city of the world make or proof of his wit and
his learning as well in things natural as in divinity
and in many such things as men many years never
attained to. Now when they perceived that they
could not a against his cunning any thing openly
prevail: they brought forth the serpentines of false
crime. And cried out that there were .xiii. of his .ix.C.
questions suspect of heresy. Then joined they to
them some good simple folk that should of zeal to ye
faith and pretence of religion impugn those questions
as new things. and with which their ears had
not be in yours. In which impugnation though some
of them happily lacked not good mind: yet lacked
they erudition and learning: which questions:
not withstanding before that / not a few famous doctors
of divinity had approved. as good and clean
and subscribed their names under them. But he not
bearing the loss of his fame made a defence for those
xiii. questions. A work of great erudition and elegant
and stuffed with the cognition of many things
worthy to be learned. which work he compiled in
xx. nights. In which it evidently appears: not only
that those conclusions were good and standing
with the faith: but also that they: which had barked
at them: were of folly and rudeness to be reproved.
which defence and all other things that he should
write: he 9mitted like a good christen man to ye most
holy judgment of our mother holy church. which
defence received: & the .xiii. questions duly by deliberation
examined: our holy father ye pope approved Pic9
and tenderly favoured him. as by a bull of our holy
father pope Alexandra the .vi. it plainly appears:
but the book in which the hole .ix.C. questions with
their conclusions were contained (for as much as
there were in them many things strange and not
fully declared and were more met for secret communication
of learned men then for open hearing of
commune people which for lake of conning might
take hurt thereby) Picus desired him self yt it should
not be read. And so was the reading thereof forbidden.
Lo this end had Picus of his hie mind and
proud purpose. yt where he thought to have gotten
perpetual praise: there had he much work to keep
him self upright: that he ran not in perpetual infamy
and slander.

Title: Of the change of his life
But as him self told his nephew he judged that
this came thus to pass: by the especial provision
and singular goodness of almighty god. that by
this false crime untruly put upon him by his evil
willers he should correct his very errors / and
that this should be to him (wandering in darkness)
as a shining light: in which he might behold & consider:
how fer he had gone out of ye way of truth.
For before this he had been both desirous of glory
and kindled in vain love: and holden in voluptuous
use of women. The comeliness of his body
with the lovely favour of his visage / and there
with all his marvelous fame / his excellent learning /
great riches and noble kindred set many women
a fire on him. from the desire of whom he not abhorring
(the way of life set a side) was somewhat fallen
in to wantonness. But after that he was once with
this variance wakened he drew back his mind flowing
in riot and turned it to christ. women's blandiments,
he changed in to te desire of heavenly joys
& despising the blast of vainglory which he before
desired / now with all his mind he began to seek the
glory and profit of christ's church and so began he
to order his 9ditio~s that from there forth he might
have been approved & though his enemy were his
judge.

Title: Of the fame of his virtue and the resort
unto him therefore.
HEre upon shortly the fame of his noble cunning
and excellent virtue both far & nigh
began gloriously to spring for which many worthy
philosophers (& that were taken in number of the most
cunning) resorted busily unto him as to a market of
good doctrine. sum for to move questions and dispute /
sum (that were of more godly mind) to
here & to take the wholesome lessons & instruction of
good living: which lessons were so much the more
set by: in how much they came from a more noble man
and a more wise man and him also which had him
self some time followed ye crooked hills of delicious
pleasure. to the fastening of good discipline in the
minds of the hearers those things seem to be of great
effect: which be both of their own nature good &
also be spoken of such a master: as is converted to the
way of justice from te crooked & ragged path of voluptuous
living.

Title: The burning of wanton books.
Five books that in his youth of wanton uses
of love with other like fantasies he had made
in his vulgar tongue: all together (in detestation of
his vice passed and lest these trifles might be some
evil occasion afterward he burned.

Title: Of his study and diligence in
holy scripture.
FRom henceforth he gave him self day & night
most fervently to the studies of scripture in
which he wrote many noble books: which well testify
both his angelic wit / his ardent labour / and
his profound erudition of which books some we have
& some as an inestimable treasure we have lost. Great
libraries it is incredible to consider with how marvelous
celerity he read them over / and wrote out what
him liked. of ye old fathers of ye church: so great knowledge
he had as it were hard for him to have yt has
lived long & all his life has don nothing ellis but
red them. Of these newer divines so good judgement
he had yt it might appear there were no thing in any
of them that were unknow to him. but all thing as
ripe as though he had all their works ever before
his yen. but of all these new doctors he specially
commended saint thomas as him yt enforced himself
in a sure pillar of truth. he was very quick / wise / and
subtle in disposition & had great felicity therein while
he had yt hie stomach. But now a great while he had
bode such conflicts farewell: and every day more and
more hated them. and so greatly abhorred them: that
when hercules estensis duke of ferrari: first by messengers
and after by him self: desired him to dispute
at ferrari: because ye general chapter of friar's preachers
was held there. long it was or he could
be brought there to: but at the instant request of the
duke which very singularly loved him he can thither
where he so behaved him self that was wonder to behold
how all ye audience rejoiced to here him for it
were not possible for a man to utter neither more cunning
nor more cunningly. But it was a communesaying with him that such altercations were for a logition
and not meetly for a philosopher. he said also
that such disputations greatly profited as were exercised
with a possible mind to searching of the
truth in secret company without great audience: but
he said that those disposition did great hurt: that were
held openly to the ostentation of learning & to win
the favour of the common people & the commendation
of follies. he thought that utterly it could unified
be but that with the desire of worship (which these
gazing disputers gape after) there is with an inseparable
bond annexed ye appetite of his confusion &
rebuke whom they argue with. which appetite is a
deadly. wound to ye soul & a mortal poison to charity
there was nothing passed him of those captions subtleties
& cavillations of sophistry / nor a gain there was
no thing yt he more hated & abhorred considering yt
they served of nought but to ye shaming of such other
folk as were in very science much better learned and
in those trifles ignorant. And yt unto searching
of ye truth (to which he gave 9tinuall labour) they
profited little or nought.

Title: Of his learning universally.
BUt because we will hold the redder no longer
in hand: we will speak of his learning but a
word or twain generally. some men had shined
in eloquence but ignorance of natural things has
dishonested him / some men have flowered in the knowledge
of diverse strange languages but he had wanted
all the cognition of philosophy. Some men have
read the inventions of the old philosophers but he
had not been exercised in the new schools. Some men
had sought cunning as well philosophy as divinity
for praise and vainglory and not for any profit or
increase of christ's church. But Picus all these things
with equal study had so received yt they might
seem by hopes as a plentious stream to have flown
in to him. for he was not of the 9dition of some folk
(which to be excellent in one thing set all other aside)
but he in all sciences profited so excellently: that which
of them so ever you had considered in him you would
have though yt he had taken that one for his only
study. And all these things were in him so much
the more marvelous in yt he came thereto by him self
with the strength of his own wit for ye love of god
and profit of his church with out masters so that we
may say of him that Epicure the philosopher said
of him self that he was his own master.

Five causes that in so short time brought
him to see marvelous cunning.
To the bringing forth of so wonderful effects
in so small time I 9sidre five causes to have
come to gender: first an incredible wit / secondly a marvelous
fast memory / thirdly great substance by the
which to ye being of his books as well latin as greek
& other tongues he was especially helped .vii.m. ducatshe had laid out in ye gathering together of volumes
of all manner of literature. The fourth cause
was his bossy & infatigable study. The fifth was the
contempt despising of all earthly things.

Title: Of his conditions and his virtue.
But now let us pass over those powers of his
soul which appertain to understanding & knowledge
& let us speak of then yt belong to ye achieving
of noble acts / let us as we can declare his excellent
conditions yt his mind inflamed to godward may
appear. And his riches given out to poor folk may
be understood / to the extent yt they which shall hear his
virtue may have occasion thereby to give especial laud
and thank therefore to almighty god of whose infinite
goodness all grace and virtue comes.

Title: Of ye sale of his lordships and alms.
Three year before his death (to the end that all ye
charge & business of rule or lordship set a side
he might led his life in rest and peace well considering
to what end this earthly honour & worldly dignity
comes) all his patrimony and dominions yt
is to say the third part of thralldom of Myrandulaand of concordia: unto Johan francis his nephew he
sold. & that so good cheap that it seemed rather a
gift then a sale. All that ever he received of this bargain
partly he gave out to poor folk / partly he bestowed
in the being of a little land to the finding of
him & his household. And over yt much silver vessel &
plate with other precious & costly utensils of household
he divided among poor people. He was content
with mean fare at his table how be it somewhat yet
retaining of the old plenty in dainty viand & silver
vessel. Every day at certain hours he gave
himself to prayer. To poor men always if any came he
plentuously gave out his money: and not content only
to give that he had him self ready: he wrote over yt / to
on .Hierom Beninevi9 a florentin a well lettered man
(whom for his great love toward him and ye integrity of
his conditions he singularly favoured) yt he should with
his own money ever help poor folk: and give maidens
money to their marriage: and always send him
word what he had laid out that he might pay it
him a gain. This office he committed to him that he
might ye more easily by him as by a faithful messenger
relive ye necessity & misery of poor needy people such
as him self happily could not come by ye knowledge of.

Title: Of ye voluntary affliction & paining of his own body.
Over all this: many times (which is not to be
kept secret) he gave alms of his own body:
we know many men which (as saint Hierom saith)
put forth their hand to poor folk: but with the pleasure
of ye flesh they be over common: but he: many days
(and namely those days which represent unto us ye
passion & death yt Christ suffered for our sake) bet and
scourged his own flesh in the remembrance of that
great benefit and for cleansing of his old offences.

Title: Of his placability or benign nature.
HE was of cheer always merry & so benign
nature yt he was never troubled with Anger &
he said ones to his nephew that what so ever should
happen (fell there never so great misadventure) he
could never as him thought be moved to wrath: but
if his chests perished in which his books lay: that he
had with great travail & watch 9piled. But for as
much as he considered yt he laboured only for ye love
of god & profitof his church: & yt he had dedicate unto
him all his works/ his studies & his doings & since
he saw yt since god is almighty they could not miscarry
but if it were either by his commandment or
by his sufferance: he verily trusted: since god is all
good: yt he would not suffer him to have that occasion
of heaviness. O very happy mind which none adversity
might oppress which no prosperity might enhance:
not the conning of all philosophy was able
to make him proud / not the knowledge of the hebrew /
chaldey & arabic language beside greek and
latin could make him vainglorious / not his great
substance/ not his noble blood could blow up his
heart / not ye beauty of his body / not ye great occasion of
sin were able to pull him back in to ye voluptuous broad
way yt leads to hell: what thing was there of so marvelous
strength yt might overturn ye mind of him
(which now as seneka saith) was gotten above fortune
as he: which as well her favour as her malice
has set at nought/ yt he might be coupled with a spiritual
knot unto christ and his heavenly citizens.

Title: How he eschewed dignities.
when he saw many men with great labour & money
desire & busily purchase ye offices & dignities of ye
church (which are now a days) alas ye while 9muneli
bought and sold) him self refused to receive them:
when two kings offered them. when an other man offered
him great worldly promotion if he would go to the
kings court he gave him such an Answer / that he
should well know that he neither desired worship nor
worldly riches but rather set them at nought yt he
might ye more quietly give him self to study & ye service
of god: this wise he persuaded/ yt to a philosopher
and him that seeks for wisdom it was no praise
to gender riches but to refuse them.

Title: Of the despising of worldly glory.
All praise of people and all earthly glory he reputed
utterly for nothing but in ye renaying
of this shadow of glory / he laboured for very glory /
which ever more follows virtue as an unseparable
servant. he said that fame oftentimes did hurt to
men while they live / & never good when they be dead.
so much only set he by his learning in how much he
knew that it was profitable to the church & to the extermination
of errors. And over that he was come
to that prick of perfect humility that he little forced
whether his works went out under his own name
or not so that they might as much profit as if they
were given out under his name. And now set he
little by any other books save only the bible. in the only
study of which: he had appointed himself to spend
the residue of his life, saying that the commune profit
pricked him when he considered so many an so great
works as he had conceived and long travailed upon
how they were of every man by and by desired
and looked after.

Title: How much he set more by devotion then conning.
THe little affection of an old man or an old
woman to godward (were it never so small)
he set more by: then by all his own knowledge as well
of natural things as godly. And often times in communication
he would admonish his familiar friends
how greatly these mortal things bow and draw to
an end how slippery and how falling it is yt we live
in now how firm how stable it shall be yt we shall
here after live in. whether we be thrown down in to
hell or lift up in to heaven. wherefore he exhorted them
to turn up their minds to love god which was a
thing far excelling all the conning that is possible
for us in this life to obtain. The same thing also in
his book which he entitled de ente et la lightsomely
he treats where he interrupts ye course of his dissipation
and turning his words to Angel9 Politianus
(to whom he dedicated that book) he writes in
this wise. But now behold o my well-beloved Angel
what madness holds us. Love god (while we be in
this body) we rather may: then either know him or
by speech utter him. In loving him also we more profit
our self / we labour less & serve him more. and
yet had we lever always by knowledge never find yt
thing that we seek: then by love to posed yt thing:
which also with out love were in vain found.

Title: Of his liberality & contempt of riches.
Liberality only in him passed measure for so
far was he from the giving of any diligence
to earthly things that he seemed somewhat besprinkled
with the freckle of negligence. his friends often times
admonished him that he should not all utterly
despise riches. showing him that it was his dishonest
& rebuke when it was reported (were it true
or false) that his negligence & setting nought by money
gave his servants occasion of deceit & robbery
Nevertheless that mind of his: (which evermore on
high cleaved fast in 9te~platio~ & in searching of natures
council) could never let down itself to ye
9sideration and overseeing of these base abject and
vile earthly trifles. his high steward came on a time
to him & desired him to receive his account of such
money as he had in many years received of his: &
brought forth his books of reckoning. Picus answered
him in this wise. my friend (saith he) I know
well you have might often times and yet may deceive
me & you list wherefore the examination of these
expenses shall not need. There is no more to do. if I be
ought in your debt I shall pay you by & by. if you be in
mine pay me. either now if you have it: or hereafter
if you be now not able.

Title: Of his loving mind & virtuous
behaviour to his friends
HIs lovers and friends with great benignity &
courtesy he entreated. whom he used in all secret
communing virtuously to exhort to godward whose
godly words so effectually wrought in the hearers:
yt where a 9nyng man (but not so good as cunning)
came to him on a day for ye great fame of his learning
to commune with him as they fell in talking of virtue
he was with the words of Picus so thoroughly proceed
yt forth with all he forsook his accustomed vice
and reformed his conditions. The words yt he said
unto him were these. If we had ever more before
our yen yepainful death of christ which he suffered for
the love of us: & then if we would again think upon
our death we should well beware of sin. Marvelous
benignity & courtesy he showed unto then: not
whom strength of body or goods of fortune magnified
but to then whom learning & 9ditio~s bound him to
favour / for similitude of manners is a cause of love
& friendship. A likeness of conditions is (as Appolloni9
saith an affinity.

Title: what he hated & what he loved
There was no thing more odious nor more intolerable
to him then as (horace saith) ye proud
palaces of stately lords. wedding / & worldly business /
he fled almost a like: notwithstanding when he
was asked once in sport whither of those two burdens
seemed lighter and which he would choose if he
should of necessity be driven to that one & at his election:
which he staked thereat a while but at ye last he
shake his head and a little smiling he answered yt he
had lever take him to marriage. as yt thing in which
was less servitude & not so much jeopardy. liberty
a above all thing he loved to which both his own natural
affection & ye study of philosophy inclined him:
& for yt was he always wondering & flitting and would
never take him self to any certain dwelling.

Title: Of his fervent love to god.
OF outward observances he gave no very great
force we speak not of those observances which
the church 9maundeth to be observed for in those he
was diligent but we speak of those ceremonies which
folk bring up setting ye very service of god a side
which is (as christ saith) to be worshipped in spirit
& in truth) But in the in ward affects of the mind
he cleaved to god with very fervent love and devotion.
some time that marvelous alacrity languished
and almost fell: and left again with great strength rose
up in to god. In the love of whom he so fervently
burned that on a time as he walked with John
francis his nephew in an orchard at ferrari in ye talking
of the love of christ he bark out in to these words.
nephew said he this will I show the I warn
the keep it secret: the substance yt I have left after
certain books of mine finished I intended to give out
to poor folk and sensing my self with the crucifix
bare foot walking about the world in every town
and castle I purpose to preach of christ. Afterwards I
understood by the especial commandment of god
he changed that purpose and appointed to profess
himself in the order of friar's preachers.

Title: Of his death.
IN the year of our redemption .m.cccc.iciiii. him
when self had fulfilled ye .xxxii. year of his age
& abode at florence he was suddenly taken with a fervent
axis which so fer forth crept in to the interior print: pertis
of his body yt it despised all medicines & overcame
all remedy and compelled him with in three days
to satisfy nature and repay his the life which he received
of his.

Title: Of his behaviour in the extremes of his life.
After that he had received the holy body of
our saviour when they offered unto him the
crucifix (yt in the image of christ's ineffable passion
suffered for our sake: he might ere he gave up the
ghost / receive his full draught of love and compassion
in the beholding of that pitiful figure as a strong
defiance against all adversity and a sure portcullis
against wicked spirits) the pressed demanded him
whither he firmly believed yt crucifix to be ye Image
of him that was very good & very man which in
his good head was before all time begotten of his father.
to whom he is also equal in all thing: and which
of the holy ghost god also: of him & of the father coeternally
going forth / which .iii. persons be one god) was
in the chaste womb of our lady a perpetual virgin
conceived in time. which suffered hunger thrust / heat /
cold / labour / travail / and watch. and which at
the last for washing of our spotty sin contracted
and drawn unto us in the sin of adam for the
sovereign love yt he had to mankind: in the alter
of the cross willingly and gladly shed out his most
prescious blood. when the pressed enquired of him these
things and such other as they be wont to enquire of
folk in such case. Picus answered him yt he not only
believed it but also certainly knew it. when that one
Albert9 his sisters son a young man both of wit cunning /
and conditions / excellent: began to comfort him
against death: & by natural reason to show him why
it was not to be feared but strongly to be taken: as yt
only thing which makes an end of all the labour /
pain / trouble / & sorrow of this short miserable deadly
life: he answered yt this was not the chief thing yt
should make him 9tent to die: because the death determines
the manifold incommodities and painful
wretchedness of this life: but rather this cause should
make him not content only: but also glade to die: for
that death makes an end of sin: in as much as he
trusted: ye shortness of his life should leave him no space
to sin & offend. He asked also all his servants
forgiveness. if he had ever before yt day offended
any of them. for whom he had provided by his testament
many years before. for some of them met and
drink / for some money each of them after their desiring.
He showed also to ye above named Albert9 &
many other credible persons yt ye queen of heaven came
to him yt night with a marvelous fragrant odor
refreshing all his members yt were browsed & freshed
with that fever & promised him that he should not utterly
die. He lay always with a pleasant and a merrycountenance and in the very twitches and pains of
death he spoke as though he beheld ye heaviness open
And all yt came to him and saluted him offering their
service: with very loving words he received / thanked /
& kissed. The executor of his moveable goods he
made on Antony his brother. The hewer of his lands
he made ye poor people of the hospital of florence:
And in his wise in to ye hands of our saviour he
gave up his spirit.

Title: How his death was taken.
what sorrow and heaviness his departing out
of this world was: both to rich and poor
high and lowe: well testifies the princes of
Italy. well witnessed the cities and people: well records
the great benignity and singular courtesy of
Charles king of france. which as he came to florence
intending from there to Rome and so forth in his
voyage against the Realm of Naples hearing of the
sickness of Picus in all convenient have he sent him
two of his own physicians as ambassadors both to
visit him and to do him all ye help they might. And
over that sent unto him letters subscribed with his
own hand full of such humanity and courtesy of
fres: as the benevolent mind of such a noble prince
and the worthy virtues of Picus required.

Title: Of the state of his soul.
After his death (and not long after) one hieronim9
a friar preacher of ferrari a man as well
in cunning as holiness of living most famous. In
a sermon which he rehearsed in the chief church of
all florence said unto ye people in this wise. O thou
City of florence I have a secret thing to show thee
which is as true as ye gospel of saint John I would
have kept it secret but I am compelled to show it.
For he that has authority to command me has
bid me publish it. I suppose verily that there be
none of you but you knew Johan Picus earl of myrandula.
a man in whom god had heaped many great gifts
and singular graces. the church had of him an inestimable
loss. for I suppose if he might have had
the space of his life prolongued: he should have excelled
(by such works as he should have left behind him) all
them that did this .viii.C. year before him. he was
wont to be conversant with me and to break to me
the secrets of his heart in which I perceived that he
was by privy inspiration called of god unto religion.
wherefore he purposed often times to obey this inspiration
and follow his calling. how be it not being
kind enough for so great benefices of god: or called
back by the tenderness of his flesh (as he was a man
of delicate complexion) he shrank from the labour / or
thinking happily yt the religion had no need of him
differed it for a time / how be it this I speak only
by conjecture. But for this delay I threatened him
two year together: yt he would be punished if he forslows
yt purpose which our lord had put in his
mind. & certainly I prayed to god my self (I will
not lie there fore) that he might be somewhat beaten: to
compell him to take that way which god had from
above showed him. but I desired not this scourge upon
him yt he was beaten with: I looked not for that:
but our lord had so decreed that he should forsake
this present life and leave a part of that noble crown
that he should have had in heaven. Notwithstanding
ye most benign judge has dealt mercifully with him:
and for his plenteous alms given out with a free
and liberal hand unto poor people & for the devout
prayers which he most instantly offered unto god
this favour he had: though his soul be not yet in
the bosom of our lord in the heavenly joy: yet is
it not on yt other side deputed unto perpetual pain.
but he is adjudged for a while to ye fire of purgatory
there to suffer pain for a season. which I am ye gladder
to show you in this behalf: to the entente that they
which knew him: & such in especially as for his manifold
benefices are singularly be holden unto him:
should now with their prayers alms / & other sufferages
help him. These things this holy man hierom
this servant of god openly affirmed. and also said
that he knew well if he lied in that place: he were worthy
eternal damnation. And over yt he said yt he had
known all those things within a certain time. but
ye words which Picus had said in his sickness of ye
apprise of our lady caused him to doubt & to fear lest
Picus had be deceived by some illusion of ye devil.
in as much as the promise of our lady seemed to have
been frustrate by his death. but afterwards he understood
yt Picus was deceived in the equivocation of ye
word while she spoke of ye second death & everlasting:
& he undertook her of ye first death & temporal. And after
this ye same hierom showed to his acquaintance
yt Pic9 had after his death appeared unto him all 9paced
in fire & showed unto him yt he was such wise in purgatory
punished for his negligence & his unkindness.
Now since it is so that he is adjudged to yt fire from
which he shall undoubtedly depart unto glory & no man
is sure how long it shall be first: & maybe ye shorter
time for our intercessions. Let every christen body show
their charity upon him to help to speed him thither
where after ye long habitation with ye inhabitants of
this dark world (to whom his goodly 9uersatio~ gave
great light) & after ye dark fire of purgatory (in which
venial offences be cleansed) he may shortly (if he be not
all ready) enter ye inaccessible & infinite light of heaven
where he may in ye presence of ye sovereign godhood so
pray for us yt we may ye rather by his intercession be partners
of yt unspeakable Joy which we have pried to
bring him speedily to. Amen. Here ends life of Johan
Picus earl of Myrandula. Finis.

Title: The argument & matter of the first epistle of Picus
unto his nephew Johan francis.
It appears by this epistle yt Johan francis
the nephew of Pic9 had broken his mind unto
Picus and had made him of council in some secretgodly purpose which he intended to take upon
him. but what this purpose should be: upon this letter
can we not fully perceive. Now after yt he thus
intended there fill unto him many impediments and
divers occasions which withstood his intent and in
manner let him & pulled him back. wherefore Picus
comforted him in this epistle and exhorts him to perseverance.
by such means as are in the epistle evident
and plain enough. Notwithstanding in ye beginning
of this letter where he saith that the flesh
shall (but if we take good heed) make us drunk in
the cups of Circes and mishap us in to the likeness
and figure of brute beasts: those words if you
perceive then not be in this wise understood. There
was sometime in. A woman called Circes
which by enchantment as virgil makes mention
used with a drink to turn as many men: as received
it in to divers likeness & figures of sundry beasts.
some in to lions / some in to bears / some in to
swine / some in to wolfs which after ward walked
ever tame about her hows and waited upon her in
such use or service as she lift to put unto them. In
like wise the flesh if it make us drunk in the wine
of voluptuous pleasure or make the soul leave ye noble
use of his reason & incline unto sensuality & affections
of the body: then ye flesh changes us from
the figure of reasonable men in to ye likeness of unreasonable
beasts. and yt diversely: after the convenience &
simulated between our sensual affections and the
brutish properties of sundry beasts. As the proud
hearted man in to a lion. the arrows in to a bear / the
lecherous in to a goat / The drunken glutton in to a
swine ye ravenous extorcioner in to a wolf ye false
deceiver in to a fox / the mocking jester in to an
ape. from which beastly shape may we never be restored
to our own likeness again: unto the time we
have cast up again the drink of the bodily affections
by which we were in to these figures enchanted.
when there comes some time a monstrous
best to ye town we run & are glad to pay some money
to have a sight thereof. but I fear if men would
like upon them self advisedly: they should see a more
monstrous best. nearer home: for they should perceive
then self by ye wretched inclination to divers beastly passions
changed in their soul not in to the shape of
one but of many beasts. yt is to say of all then whose brutishappetites they follow. Let us then beware as pic9
conceals us yt we be not drunken in ye cups of Circes
yt is to say in ye sensual affections of ye flesh lest / we deform
ye image of god in our souls after whose image
we be made & make our self worse then idolaters
for if he be odious to god which turns ye image of
a best in to god: how much is he more odious which
turns the image of god in to a best.

Johan Picus earl of Myrandula to Johan
francis his nephew by his brother health in
him that is very health.
THat thou have had many well occasions after
thy departing which trouble thee & stoned
a against the virtuous purpose that thou have taken
there is no cause mi son why thou should either marvel
thereof / be sorry therefore / or dread hit. but rather
how great a wonder were this if only to ye among mortal
men the way lay open to heaven without sweat
as thought yt now at first / the deceitful word & the
cursed devil failed. & as though thou were not yet
in ye flesh: which covets against the spirit: & which
false flesh (but if we watch and like well to our self)
shall make us drunk in the cups of circes & so deform
us in to monstrous shapes of brutish & unreasonable
beasts. Remember also that of this evil occasions
ye holy apostle saint James saith thou have
cause to be glad writing in this wise. Gaudete fratres
quam in temptationes varias incideritis. Be glad
saith he my brethren when you fall in diverse temptations.
and not causeless for what hope is there of glory
if there be none hope of victory: or what place is
there for victory where there is no battle: he his called
to the crown & triumph which is provoked to the conflict
& namely to that conflict: in which no man may
be overcome against his will. and in which we need none
other strength to vanquish but yt we list our self to
vanquish. Very happy is a christen man since yt ye victory
is both put in his own freewill: & the reward
of the victory shall be far greater than we can either
hope or wish. Tell me y pray the my most dear son
if there be ought in this life of all those things: ye delight
whereof so vexed and tossed these earthly minds
Is there I say any of those trifles: in ye getting of which
a man must not suffer many labours many displeasures
& many miseries or he get it. The merchant
thinks himself well served if after .x. years sailing /
after a .m. incommodities / after a .m. Ieopardyes of
his life he may at last have a little the more gatheredtogether. Of the court & service of this world there
is nothing yt I need to write unto thee. the wretchedness
whereof the experience itself has taught the &
daily teaching. In obtaining the favour of ye princes /
in purchasing the friendship of the company in ambitious
labour for offices & honours. what an heap
of heaviness there is: how great anguish: how much business
and trouble I may rather learn of the then tech
ye. which holding my self content with my books
& rest / of a child have learned to live within my degree
and as much as I may dwelling with my self
nothing out of my self labour for / or long for. Now
then these earthly things slipper / uncertain / vile &
commune / also to us and brute beasts: sweating & panting
we shall uneath obtain: and like we then to heavenly
things and godly (which neither eye has seen
nor ear has heard nor heart has thought) to be drawn
slumber & sleeping meagry our teeth: as though
neither god might reign nor those heavenly citizens
live with out us. Certainly of this worldly felicity
were gotten to us with idleness and ease then might
some man that shrinks from labour: rather choose
to serve ye world then god. But now if we be forlaboured
in the way of sin as much as in the way of
god and much more (whereof the dampened wretches
cry out lassati sumus in via iniquitatis we be wearied
in the way of wickedness
then must it needs
be appoint of extreme madness if we had not lever labour
there where we go from labour to reward then
where we go fro labour to pain. I pass over, how
great peace & felicity it is to the mind when a man
has nothing that grudges his conscience nor is not
appalled with the secret witch of any privy crime.
this pleasure undoubtedly far excelled all yt pleasures
yt in this life may be obtained or desired. what thing
is there to be desired among ye delights of this world?
which in the seeking weary us. in the having blinds
us. in the losing pains us. do thou my son
whether the minds of wicked men be vexed or not
with continual thought & torment: it is the word
of god which neither may deceive nor be deceived.impii quasi mare seruens quote quiescere no potest.
                     
The wicked man heart is like a stormy see yt
may not rest. there is to him no thing sure / no thing peaceable
but all thing fearful / all thing sorrowful / all thing
deadly. Shall we then envy these men: shall we follow
them: and forgetting our own country heaven / &
our own heavenly father where we were / free born: shall
we wilfully make our self their self their bound:
& with them wretchedly living / more wretchedly die
and at ye last most wretchedly in ever lasting fire be
punished. O the dark minds of men. O the blind
hearts. who says not more clear then light that all
these things be (as they say) truer then truth it
self. & yet do we not that yt we know is to be done.
In vain we would pluck our foot out of ye clay but
we strike still. There shall come to thee my son doubt
it not (in these places namely where thou art conversant)
innumerable impediments every hour: which
might fear the from the purpose of god and virtuous
living (and but if thou be ware) shall throw thee
down headlong. But among all things the very
deadly pestilence is this: to be conversant day and
night among them whose life is not only on every
side an elective to sin: but over that all set in the
expugnation of virtue. under their captain the devil.
under the binary of death. under the stipend of
hell. fighting a against heaven. a against our lord god
and a against his christ. But cry thou therefore with
the prophet diru~pamus vincula eorum & proiiciamus
a nobis inguz ipso4. Let us break the bands
of them & let us cast of the yoke of them. These be
they whom (as ye glorious apostle saint Paul says)
our lord has delivered in to the passions of rebuke
and to a reprovable sense to do those things that
are not convenient / full of all iniquity / full of envy /
manslaughter. contention / gel / & malice / backbiters
odious to god 9tumeliouse / proud / stately / finders
of evil things / foolish / dissolute / with out affection
with out covenant with out mercy which when they
daily see the justice of god yet understood they not
that such as these things come: are worthy death.
not only they yt do such things: but also they which
consent to the doing: wherefore my child go thou neverabout to please them: whom virtue displeases. but
ever more let these words of the apostle be before
them eyes. Oportet magic deo placer q~ hoi~bus  we
must rather please god then men. and remember these
words of saint Paul also. hominibus placere~
serve9 christi non essem If I should please men I were
not christ's servant. Let enter in to thine heart an holy
pride & have disdain to take them for masters
of thine living which have more need to take the for a
master of theirs. It were far more seeming yt they
should with ye by good living begin to be men then
thou should with them by ye leaving off thy good purpose
shamefully begin to be a best. There holds me
some time by almighty god as it were even a swoon
and an insensibility for wonder when I begin in my
self: I knew never whether I shall say: to remember
or to sorrow / to marvel or to bewail the appetites
of men. or if I shall more plainly speak: ye very madness
not to believe the gospel whose truth the blood
of martius cries yt voice of apostles sounds / miraclesproves / reason confirms / the world testifies / ye
elements speaks / devils confesses. But a far greater
madness is it if thou doubt not but that the gospel
is true: to live then as though thou doubtestnot but that it were false. For if these words of the
words of the gospel be true / yt it is very hard
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven why
do we daily then gape after the heaping up of riches.
And if this be true that we should seek for the glory
and praise not that comes of men but that comes
of god why do we then ever hang upon the judgement
& opinion of men and no man reckons whether
god like him or not. And if we surely believe yt ones
the time shall come in which our lord shall say go
you cursed people in to ever lasting fire & again come
you my blessed children posed you the kingdom that
has been prepared for you from the forming of the
world why is there no thing then yt we less fear then
hell or yt we less hope for / then the kingdom of god.
what shall we say ellis but that there be many christen
men in name but few in deed. But thou my son enforce
thy self to enter by ye straight gate yt leads to
heaven & take no heed what thing many men do: but
what thing ye vary law of nature / what thing very reason
what thing our lord him self shows ye to be done
for neither thine glory shall be less if thou be happy with
few nor thy pain more easy if thou be wretched with
many. Thou shalt have .ii. specially effectual remedies
against the world & the devil with which two:
as with .ii. whinges: thou shalt out of this vale of misery
be lift up in to heaven / that is to say alms deed
and prayer. what may we do with out ye help of god
or how shall he help us if he be not called upon?
But over that certainly he shall not here the when
thou call on him if thou here not first ye poor man
when he calls upon thee & verily it is according
that god should despise thee being a man when thou
being a man despises a man. For it is written in
what measure yt you met: it shall be met you again
And in an other place of ye gospel it is said blessed
be merciful men for they shall get mercy. when I
stir the to prayer I stir ye not to ye prayer which stands
in many words but to that prayer which in ye
secret chamber of the mind / in the privy closet of ye
soul with very affect speaks to god and in ye most
lightsome darkness of contemplation not only presents
the mind to the father: but also unite it with
him by unspeakable ways which only they know that
have assayed. Nor I care not how long or how short
thy prayer be / but how effectual how ardent / and rather
interrupted & broken between with sighs then
drawn on length with a continual row & number
of words if thou love thine health / if thou desire to be sure
from ye green's of the devil / from the storms
of this world / from the await of thine enemies if thou
long to be acceptable to god if thou covett to be happy
at the last: let no day pass the but thou ones at ye
lest wise present thy self to god by prayer and falling
down by fore him flat to ye ground with an humble
affect of devout mind not from ye extremity of thy
lips but out of ye inwardness of thine heart cry these
words of the prophet. Delicta iuue~tuts~ me & ignora~tias
meas nor memineris sed secu~du~ misericordia~
tua~ meme~to mei p~pter bonitate~ tua~ dn~e.The offences
of my youth & mine ignorances remember not good
lord / but after thy mercy lord for thy goodness remember
me. when thou shalt in thy prayer are of god:
both ye holy spirit which prays for us and eke thine
own necessity shall every hour put in thine mind. & also
what you shalt pray for: thou shalt find matter
enough in the reading of holy scripture which yt thou
would now (setting poet's fables & trifles a side)
take ever in thine hand I heartily pray ye. Thou mast
do no thing more pleasant to god no thing more profitable
to thy self: then if thine hand cease not day
nor night to turn & read the volumes of holy scripture.
There lies privily in them a certain heavenly
strength quick and effectual which with a marvelous
power transforms & changes ye readers mind in
to the love of god if they be clean & lowly entreated.

Title: The matter or argument of the epistle of
Picus to Andrew Corneus.
THis Andrew a worshipful man and a especial
friend of Picus had by his letters given
him counsel to leave the study of philosophy as
a thing in which he thought Pic9 to have spent time
Enough and which: but if it were applied to ye use
of some actual business: he judged a thing vain & unprofitable.
wherefore he counselled Picus to surcease
of study and put himself with some of ye great princes
of Italy. with whom (as this Andrew said) he
should be much more fruitfully occupied then always
in the study & learning of philosophy to whom picus
answered as in this present epistle appears where he
saith these words (By this it should follow that it
were either servile or at ye leastwise not precisely to make
the study of philosophy other then mercenary) thus
he means. Mercenary we call all those things
which we do for hire or reward. Then he wakes philosophy
mercenary & uses it not as cunning but
as merchandise which studies it not for pleasure
of it self: or for the instruction of his mind in mortal
virtue: but to apply it to such things where he
may get some lucre or worldly advantage.

Johan Picus earl of myrandula to andrew
Corneus greeting.
You exhort me by your litres to the civil and
active life saying that in vain: and in manner
to my rebuke & shame have I so long studied
in philosophy. But if I would at the last exercise
yt learning in the entreating of some profitable acts
and outward business. Certainly my well beloved andrew
I had cast a way both cost and labour of my
study: if I were so minded that I could find in my
heart in this matter to assent unto you and follow your
counsel. This is a very deadly and monstrous persuasion
which has entered the minds of men: believing
that the studies of philosophy are of estates &
princes: either utterly not to be touched: or at least wise
with extreme lips to be sipped (and rather to ye pomp
and ostentation of their wit then to the culture &
profit of their minds to be little & easily tasted. The
words of Neoptoleni9 they hold utterly for a sure
decree that philosophy is to be studied either never
or not long. but the sayings of wise men they repute
for Japes & very fables: that sure & steadfast felicity
stands only in the goodness of the mind & that
these outward things of ye body or of fortune little
or nought pertain unto us. But here you will say to
me thus. I am content you study. but I would have
you outwardly occupied also. And I desire you not
so to embrace martha that you should utterly forsake
Mary. Love them & use them both as well study as
worldly occupation. Truly my well-beloved friend
in this point I gain say you not. they that so do I
find no fault in. nor I blame them not. but certainly
it is not all one to say we do well if we do so: and
to say we do evil but if we do so. this is far out of
the way: to think that from contemplation to the active
living that is to say from the better to the worse
is none error to decline And to think that it were
shame to abide still in the better and not decline.
Shall a man then be rebuked because that he desires
and ensues virtue only for it self: because he
studies ye mysteries of god: because he searches
the counsel of nature because he uses continually
this pleasant ease & rest: seeking none outward thing
despising all other thing: sith those things are able
sufficiently to satisfy the desire of their followers. By
this reckoning it is a thing either servile or at ye lest
wise not princely to make ye study of wisdom other
then mercenary. who may well here this who may
suffer hit. Certainly he never studied for wisdom
which so studied therefore that in time to come either
he might not or would not study therefore. this man rather
exercised the study of merchandise then of wisdom.
you writ unto me that hit is time for me now
to put my self in household with some of the great
princes of Italy but I see well yt as yet you have not
known the opinion that philosophers have of them
self which (as horace said (repute then self kings of
kings: they love liberty: they can not bear ye proud
manners of estates: they can not serve. They dwell
with them self and be content with the tranquillity
of their own mind they suffice them self & more /
they seek nothing out of them self: the things that
are had in honour among ye 9mune people: among
them be not holden honourable. All that ever the voluptuous
desire of men thirsts for: or ambition sighs
for: they set at nought and despise. which while
it belongs to all men: yet undoubtedly it pertains
most properly to them whom fortune has so liberally
favoured that they may live not only well and
plentuously but also nobly. These great fortunes lift
up a man high and sets him out to the show: but often
times as a fierce and a skittish horse they cast of
their master. certainly always they grieve and bear
him and rather tear him then bear him. The golden
mediocrity the mean estate is to be desired which
shall bear us as it were in hands more easily. which
shall obey us & not master us. I therefore abiding
firmly in this opinion: set more by my little house my
study / the pleasure of my books / ye rest and peace of
my mind: then by all your kings palaces all your
commune business / all your glory. all the advantage
that you hawk after. and all the favour of the court
Nor I like not for this fruit of my study yt I may
thereby hereafter be tossed in the flood and rambling
of your worldly busyness: but yt I may ones bring
forth the children that I travail on: yt I may give
out some books of mine own to the commune profit
which may somewhat savour: if not of cunning yet at
the lest wise of wit and diligence. And because you
shall not think that my travail & diligence in study
is any thing remitted or flaked: I give you knowledge
yt after great fervent labour with much watch
and infatiguable travail I have learned both the hebrew
language and the chaldey and now have I set
hand to overcome the great difficult of the Arab
tongue. These my dear friend be things: which to appertain
to a noble prince I have ever thought and
yet think. Fare you well. written at Paris the .xv.
