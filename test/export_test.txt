IN Most humble wise Complained 
unto your highness / that 
where as this noble realm of England / 
has of long time out of mind 
been the most free country in all Christendom / 
Now is like to be brought in 
to bondage and slavery of such a nation 
as all the world both hates and abhors. 
The only occasion there off is our unthankfulness / as 
our preachers and true prophets declared unto us 
in the time off your brother / that most virtues 
prince king Edward the vj. That if we would 
not be thankful for that great benefit off gods 
holy word / then truly preached among us. God 
would take away our said virtues king / and set up 
a strange king to reign over us / for our unrepentant 
hearts / who should bring in again / popery / 
idolatry / and all abominations / as it is come to 
pass this day. For when that blessed word off 
god was truly preached among us / we followed 
it not in living / but did as the Jews which followed 
christ / because they eat off his bread and were 
filled. Even so did the most part off every state 
and degree in the common Weal / hear the gospel preached 
not because they sought the glory off god only / 
and so to have framed them selves to live there 
after / as they ought to do. But lived as in the time 
off there former darkness / in evil lust / using extortion 
covetousness / and bribery? Neither sought
they the true liberty off the gospel / to set there consciences 
free from sin and superstition. Which now (alas) 
appears by there so ready mutability / provoking 
gods heavy Ire and wrath with there seeming to 
allow Idolatry: which Passed all the former evil. 
So that it is to be dread / gods Justs does 
punish one sin by another / which off all is most 
perilous / and dangerous / as appears by them 
which be given up off god / because they seek not to 
glorify god / according to the knowledge he has 
offered unto them but Wandering in the vanities 
off there own reasons / and imagination off there 
own hearts: become at last to be confirmed in error 
with strong illusions / because they have 
had no more ernest desire to the truth / as the holy 
apostle does most plainly declare. On the other 
side / some were wilful / stubborn and hard hearted / 
and would not receive the gospel off the glory off 
god / but with desire to there old idolatry / hastened 
the vegeance off god. And therefore are these 
plagues Justly come upon us because off our unthankfulness / 
and not knowing the time off our 
visitation. For gods holy book does show these / 
to be the very and in fallible causes off the overthrow 
of kingdoms and common weals / specially where 
god off his mercy / has offered the knowledge off 
him self / and caused his word to be truly preached. 
Wherefore your grace may call to remembrance 
the great and manifold benefits that you have 
received at the hands of almighty god / who by 
his permission has so quietly set you in your estate 
and honour that you be in at this time / and has 
also contrary to men's expectation given you fruit 
in your body / as it is reported. And according to 
certain off  your privy counsel setting forth to the 
world in print / with there hands at it / and as the 
act off parliament does pronounce and declare / providing for the same. besides many other gifts 
he has endued you with all. Wherefore look 
to betimes / least you be found unthankful for all 
those benefits that god off his mercy so richly 
has poured upon you / now that you see those plagues 
Justly come upon the realm / that god plagued 
other realms with all for there unthankfulness. 
We have a notable example off the Jews / who 
were gods elect and chosen people whom god with 
almighty hand delivered out of the bondage of 
Egypt brought them through the red see / fed them 
with heavenly bread xl years in the wilderness / 
gave them in possession many kingdoms / and drove 
out many nations before them / so that quietly 
they enjoyed there countries and dominions. And 
for all those benefits / god required no more off 
them but to love him with all there hearts / and to keep 
his commandments / and in no wise to serve 
any strange gods made off silver or gold wood or 
stone et c. like as the nations had done / whom god 
cast out before them for the same offences. This 
not withstanding / they forgot god that had done 
so many benefits for them / and worshipped strange 
gods / like as the heathen did. then god sent unto 
them his holy prophets to warn them to forsake there 
abominable idolatry / but they would not obey 
gods holy prophets but murdered them as 
plainly appears (like as our bishops will murder 
gods true preachers and prophets nowadays 
which have preached the like message of god) but 
what followed for there unthankfulness / did not god 
plague them by sending strangers among them / which 
destroyed many hundred thousands in their former 
times of her captivities and changes off there 
common weal / and at the last utter dissolution: 
namely at the destruction off Jerusalem / by Titus 
and Vespacianus the emperors / and also destroyed 
there gooly cities / carried them out off there own 
countries / where they be now scattered abroad / made 
flaws / despised / and abhorred off all nations as 
it is manifest and plain at this day. This is a 
goodly example for your grace and for all chasten 
princes to mark and to have all ways before your 
eyes / least you and they be found unthankful: And 
know you this surely / that if god spared not the 
Jews / which were his elect and chosen people / 
much less will he sparse you / if you anger him with 
strange worshipping and serving of strange gods / 
and setting up abominations / like as they did. 
I have hard many times that you do it off a zeal 
that you have to Religion / yea but your zeal is not according 
to knowledge of gods holy word / for god 
did forbid his people / the children of Israel to do that they thought good in there own eyes: but willed 
them to do that only which he commanded them. 
Nadab and Abyw the sons off Aaroy / offered 
strange fire before the lord that he commanded them 
not / and therefore were consumed with the same fire. 
Likewise king Saul contrary to gods commandment / 
off a good intent reserved certain off the best off 
the oxen and sheep / (as he said) to do sacrifice to 
the lord / what followed off it? was he not therefore 
deposed from his Kingdom. This is also a goodly 
example for your grace to mark / and to beware how 
you enterprise to do things off a good intent / having 
no warranties of gods revealed will in his word / 
but his word manifestly against you. Your grace 
therefore before you had done any thing in the change 
off religion / ought first to have known if gods 
word would have permitted you / as in the first convocation / 
you began well to have had the matter openly 
disputed: but the more pity / the thing was not 
indifferently handled / for the chief off the learned men 
being married according to the laws both of god 
and also off the realm / cold not be suffered the same 
time to dispute / and yet those few learned men which 
were there unmarried / were nor indifferently herd / 
but things proceeded clean contrary to that / those few 
provide by good learning / as all men that were there 
present can testify. A lamentable case / that gods 
word / his true religion / and his ministers / 
must be so condemned / not being indifferently 
herd? but no great marvel / for christ him self / 
and all his apostles and prophets / were so herd /
and so condemned: and the like has commonly 
been used since the world began. 
For ever more the wicked persecuted the good 
and godly: as kayn persecuted his brother Able 
even to the death / and Esawe persecuted his brother 
Jacob / and ever the false Prophets / and 
Priests / have persecuted the true Prophets 
and Preachers off god to death. And here off we 
have a notable example in the scripture / the 
which I would desire your grace to read / and to 
mark the same well. In the / 22. chapter off the 
third book off Kings / when king Achab was going 
to war against the Syryans / he called for all 
his prophets / to know of them whether he should 
go to war or not / and his false prophets counseled 
him to go / saying that he should prosper against 
them. And when only gods true prophet in deed / 
was called / the prophet Micheas / he saying the 
truth / contrary to the great number off the false 
prophets which were in number / 400 / was smitten 
therefore / which was his reward. Then he 
said here the word off the lord / I saw the lord 
sit on his seat / and all the host of heaven stood about 
him / on his right hand and on his left. And he said 
who shall persuade King Achab that he 
may go to war / and fall before his enemies / and 
there came forth a certain spirit and stood before the 
lord / and said I will persuade him: and the lord 
said to him where with / and he said I will go out 
and be a false spirit in the mouth of his prophets / 
and he said thou shalt persuade him / go forth them 
and do even so: And the prophet Micheas said behold 
the lord has put a lying sprite in the mouth 
off all these thy prophets &c. And for his saying 
the truth he was smitten and cast in prison / and 
king Achab following the counsel of his great number 
off false prophets / went to the wars and was 
slain. And here may your grace see also / that the 
truth stands not in the multitude and number. 
This example I would desire your grace to mark 
well / and give not so much credence / to your false 
bishops and clergy / which with there lies deceived 
you (as that multitude off false prophets 
deceived King Achab to his destruction) and caused 
the true preachers and prophets / which have 
preached god's word truly to be put in prison / and 
if your grace help them not / they will murder 
and destroy them / like as there predecessors have always 
done. And here I may specially make mention to 
your grace of that virtues and learned man Thomas 
Cramner Archbishop of Canterbury / who has said 
your graces life / and put him self in Jeopardy 
for your graces cause / as it is well known Bisome 
off his enemies / that were off King Edwards 
counsel and I doubt not but that your grace knows 
of it / and there fore I trust your grace will requite 
him with mercy / and not suffer that wicked 
bishop off winchester / to have his wicked will 
and purpose off him.
We read also in the 18. chapter off the third book 
off the kings / after that almighty god at the 
prayer off the prophet Elias / had shut the heavens 
that it rained not in three years and six months / 
and king Achab meting with the prophet Elias / 
he said to him: thou art he that troubles all Israel 
(like as steven gardener bishop off winchester and 
his fellows / saith to the pour preachers and professors 
of Christ's gospel now a days) but Elias 
words shall answer him / wherewith he answered 
king Achab. It is he and his accomplices / that have 
forsaken the living god / and do go a whoring after 
strange gods / as the matter shall plainly appear 
when god will / like as it did appear by Elias / with 
the 400. false prophets / which false prophets had 
seduced the queen Isabel / and had caused her to 
slay and destroy all gods holy prophets (like as 
our false and cruel bishops intended to do) so 
that the prophet Elias was fain to fly in to the wilderness / 
to save his life / where god appointed A Raven 
to feed him: but what was the end both of 
the queen and of all those false prophets / Read 
the text / and you shall plainly perceive that the queen 
was cast down out of a window where she brake 
her neck and was eaten up of dogs / as the prophet 
of god had before said / and all here false prophets 
and priests were utterly destroyed. 
Let this grievous example move your grace do 
beware be times of your false bishops and clergy / 
specially of steven gardener bishop of winchester / 
who now this third time has reacted as 
your grace knows: first he swear to the pope but 
by all likelihood he played the fox / and feigned him
self to be a sleep / or dreamed when he so did / after 
that he swear to your noble father R. H. 8. and more 
plainly declared the same by his book / de vera 
obedientia. Which was made of him with great 
advisement and deliberation / as appears here 
after by bishop bonner / in his prologue to the same 
book. Here I would make a supplication to your 
grace / beseeching you for our saviour Jesus Christ's 
sake / that you will with good deliberation / 
cause to be read before you / the said book which 
he named the true obedience / if it please your grace 
at my humble request / so to do / as your duty is 
before god: you shall plainly perceive with what 
scripture and reasons / he thoroughly confuted the 
usurped pour and authority of the bishop of Rome / 
and in his book that he made against the hunting 
of the fox likewise. And in the same book de 
vera obedientia (for to flatter your noble father) he 
does therein prove the marriage between him. And 
your mother queen katherine / not to be good nor 
lawful / to your great reproach and slander / as much 
else in him lay / for these be his words. 
To make mention of certain of the moral 
precepts / (for I mind not to rehearse all) which be 
in the old law concerning marriages which be forbidden / 
and marriages which be incestuous / those 
precepts which be commanded / and pertain to chastity 
and purity of marriages / wherein is contained 
the hole course of mans life / and the beginning of 
the bringing forth of Issue consisted: those laws / 
though Levitical / have ever been counted as those / 
which in deed were first given unto the Jews / 
because they were expounded to the setting forth of 
the law of nature / but pertained therefore to all mankind 
for ever / In which without doubt both the 
voice of nature / and gods commandment agreeing 
in one / have forbidden that which should be differing 
for ether of them. but among these precepts /
seeing that commandment is contained / which is that 
the brother should not mary the brothers wife: 
What other thing ought or cold the kings most 
excellent Majesty do / then that he has done / with 
the full consent of the people / and with the Judgment 
of his church / that being divorced from unlawful 
bonds (or covenants) to enjoy lawful and 
permitted copulation / and obeying to the precepts 
(as it was meat) to leave here which neither 
law nor right did permit to keep / and to give him 
self to chaste and lawful matrimony. In the 
which thing / where as the sentence of gods / word 
had been sufficient (unto the which all ought to 
obey / without stop or stay) yet was his most sacred 
royal Majesty contented to Join there unto / 
the voices of most grave men / and the determinate 
Judgments of the most famous universities in 
the world / namely that he might be Judged to have 
done those things most rightfully / by the allowance 
(or sentences) of the best learned and most godly 
men / which otherwise he both might and ought 
to do / and that it might appear / he did therein show 
obedience as the truth of gods word does require 
of every godly and good man / so that it may be said 
of him worthily / that he has obeyed god / and 
obeyed in dead / of whom seeing I have begone to 
speak / I cold not with silence pass over that 
which offered it self / fully and meat for this place / 
&c.
Wherly your grace and all other / may learn to 
know him and his like / by his sayings then and 
his doings now. More over in his said book de 
vera obediencia he pretended such constancy against 
the usurped authority of the bishop of Rome / 
that therein he saith / that if ever he change or 
vary / from his sayings in the said book against 
the see of Rome / that then he wills all men to 
call him what they list / so that if any man call 
him false perjured heretic / blood soper / dissembler 
traitor to god and to the hole Realm of England / 
he ought not to be angry with them / because he 
has given his own Judgment upon him self / and 
willed all men so to do / as appears by his own 
words in his own book / And now again since 
that time / is fallen from god / and worshipped the 
beast of Rome. Ought there any credence to be given 
to such a perjured person? for gods sake beware 
of him betimes / least you be partaker of his wickedness / 
and so both you and the hole Realm repent 
it / and come to utter destruction. For his doings declare 
that he is at a point with him self and has 
made covenant with death and hell / Esa. 28. and 
believes that there is no resurrection of the flesh 
nor life after this: and therefore what cares he if he 
help to bring this noble realm in to bondage and 
slavery / seeing he thinks there is no another way / 
to maintain his pomp / pride / and vainglory with 
all / And therefore the greater shall be his damnation / 
besides gods great plagues which shall come 
upon him suddenly / when he thinks all is well / 
and in quiet / them shall suddenly come his confusion 
and utter destruction / because all his doings be so 
directly against god / and all right / as his own conscience 
knows the same / to his damnation / if he 
have any conscience or feeling of god / and therefore 
beware that you be not partaker with him. 
Does not your grace think / or at the least I do 
believe it / that the complaint and cry of widows 
and fatherless children / is ascended in to the ears 
of all mighty god / and that only by his means 
so many honest men have been divorced from there 
lawful wives who has been lawfully married 
both by gods law / and the laws of this Realm / 
who is able to disallow it / non but Martin doctor 
of lies (I would have said of laws) with his ignorant 
folly / who greatly seeking to come to promotion / 
has made a slanderous book (with the help 
of his master gardener) against such married priests / 
and contrary to all honesty / has shamefully 
lied upon the old doctors / which he alleged to 
maintain his foolish enterprise. Oh haw many 
bastards and harlots / would he cause to be made / 
which were both begotten and born in lawful matrimony? 
Your grace may perceive by his said book / de veraobediencia / that he did his diligence / to 
have done the like with you / with the help of boner 
bishop of London / does not your grace think 
that god will be avenged of this great Injury / 
(although you do it not) you I believe that the cry of 
these / besides the blasphemy that he has done to 
god / and Injury to your hole Realm / will bring 
him to A shameful end / unless he despair / and so 
murder him self / as his predecessor thomas wolf 
late cardinal did / so and cast both body and soul 
in to hell. if che cry of one poor widow did bring 
the skin of the wicked Judge over his ears / how 
much more / shall the cry of these pour men women 
and children / which cry daily to god for Justice / 
whose vengeance against him / shall come upon him. 
A notable example he has (if any grace were 
in him) of william Langshape / who was bishop of 
Ely / and lord chancellor of England / and having 
the hole rule and governance of the Realm in 
his own hand / (like as steven gardener now has) 
who in those days with his fellows the bishops 
and clergy according to there common practises / sent 
the king over the see A pilgrimage / whose name 
was king Richard cure de lion / to fight against 
the great turk for Jerusalem / in the mean season 
this bishop wonderfully oppressed the commons / 
abusing the Kings authority / and advanced his 
own pomp and vain glory / (like as steven gardener 
does) And Rood with a thousand horses continually / 
so that the noble men's sons were glad 
to become his slaves / And with the best barons 
and earls &c. married he his cousins / nieces / and 
Kinswomen / (I will not say his daughters) and 
for all that his grandfather was but a pour ploughmen / 
and his father a cowherd? And having so 
tyrannously abused his office / fearing least he should 
have been called to his examination / fled with 
a few of his trusty servants to dover castle / minding 
to have stolen over the see / and coming in the 
night in a women's apparel / with a piece of cloth 
under his arm / and a metered in his hand upon / 
suspicion (as god would have it) being known what 
he was / his kercher was pulled of his head / his balams 
mark / or shaven crone appeared on his head: 
And then was he drawn / a long by the sea on the 
sands / with a great wondering of all the people / 
some rated him / some reviled him / some bespateled 
him / some drawing him by the arms / 
some by the legs from place to place / his own servants 
not being able to help him / at last they brought 
him to a dark cellar / where they covered him 
with shame enough / till the counsel of the Realm 
sent for him and after was brought to the tower 
of London / imprisoned examined / deprived / and 
banished the Realm and so ended his life. 
Here before I have mentioned of the prologue 
that Edmond bonner now bishop of London made / 
being them but archdeacon of lester / for to come 
to promotion / whereby he obtained his bishopric / 
made this prologue before the said steven gardeners 
book de vera obedientia / And for because the same 
prologue is / but short and pithy / I will recite it 
here again translated in to English word for word / 
as be caused it to be printed in latin at Hamburg 
1536. 
Edmond Boner archdeacon of lester / the king 
of England his most excellent My. ambassador 
in Denmark / to the sincere gentile hearted and 
godly redder. 
FOR As much as there be some (doubtless) 
even at this present as it has all wise 
been the wont of men's Judgments to be variable 
and divers / which think the controversy that 
is between the King of England and of france / 
his most Real majesty / and the bishop of Rome / 
consisted in this point / because the kings said 
Majesty / has taken the most excellent / and most 
noble Lady Anne to his wife. Whereas in very deed 
notwithstanding / the matter is fear other wise / 
and nothing so. Wherefore to the intent all that heartily 
favour the gospel of christ / (which that most 
godly and most virtues prince does with all diligence 
endeavour / and in every place advance to 
the honour of almighty god / and that hate not 
but love the truth / (which every where Justly 
claimed the upperhand / and to hate all things / 
though they struggle with here never so much in the 
beginning / yet obey and give place at length as 
meat it is they should) my the more fully understood 
the chief point of the controversy / and because 
they shall not be ignorant / what the hole voice and 
resolute determination / of the best and greatest 
learned bishops / with all the nobles and commons 
of England is not only in that cause of matrimony / 
but also in the defending the gospels doctrine. 
This oration of the bishop of winchester (a man excellently 
learned in all kind of learning) entitled DE VERA 
OBEDIENTIA, that is concerning true obedience / 
which he made lately in England / shall be 
published but as touching this bishops worthy 
praises / there shall be nothing spoken of me at this 
time / not only because they are infinite / but because 
they are far better known do all Christendom / 
them becomes me here to make rehearsal. And 
as for the oration it self which as it is most learned / 
so it is most elegant / to what purpose should I make 
any words of it seeing it praised it self enough 
and seeing good wine needs no tavern bus he to 
utter it. But yet in this oration who so ever thou 
art most gentile reader: thou shalt beside other matters / 
see it notably and learnedly handled / of what importance 
and how invincible the power and excellency 
of gods truth is: which as it my now and them be 
pressed of enemies / so it cannot possible be oppressed 
after such sort / but it comes again at length 
after banishment / more glorious and more welcome. 
Thou shalt see also touching obedience / that 
it is subject to truth / and what is to be Judged 
true obedience. Besides this of men's traditions / 
which for the most part be most repugnant against 
the truth of gods law. And there by the way / 
he speaks of the kings said highness marriage / 
which by the right Judgment authority and privilege / 
of the most and principal / universities of 
the world / and then with the consent of the hole 
church of England / he contracted with the most 
clear / and most noble lady. QUEEN ANNE. 
After that touching the Kings Majesties title 
as pertaining to the supreme head of the church 
of England. 
Lastly of all / of the false pretended supremacy of the 
the bishop of Rome / in the realm of England / most 
Justly abrogated: and how all other bishops 
being fellow like to him in there function you and in 
some points above him within there own provinces / 
were before time bound to him by there other. 
But be thou most surely persuaded of this good 
reader / that the bishop of Rome / though there were 
no cause else / but this marriage / will easily content 
him self / specially when there is one morsel or 
other laid to him to chew. But when he seith so 
mighty a King / being a right virtues / and a great 
learned prince / so sincerely and so heartily favour 
the gospel of christ / and perceives the yearly ravenous 
pray) you so large a pray / that it comes to 
as much almost as all the kings revenues) snapped 
out of his hands / and that he could no longer exercise 
his tyranny in the kings my. realm (alas it 
has been to cruel / and bitter all this while) nor make 
laws as he has done many / to the contumely / and 
reproach of the majesty of god / which is evident 
that he has done in time past / under the title of 
the catholic church and the authority of peter and 
Paul / (when not withstanding he was a very ravening 
wolf dressed in sheeps clothing calling 
him self servant of servants) to the great damage 
of the christen common wealth: there off arose the complaints: 
Then came these discords / these deadly 
malices / and so great trouble's bustling. For if it 
were not thus / no man could believe/ but that this 
Jupiter of Olimpius (which has falsely taken upon 
him pour / with out controlment / and to be above 
all laws) would have done his best that this good
and godly /and right ghospel-like prince / should be falsely 
betrayed to all the rest of monarchs and princes. 
Neither let it move the / gentile reader / that the bishop 
of winchester / did not before now apply to this 
opinion / for he him self in this  oration shows the 
cause / why he did it not. And if he had said never 
a word / yet thou know well what a witty part 
it is for a man to suspend his Judgment / and not to be 
to rash in giving of judgment. It is an old said saw: 
Mary Magdalene profited us less in here quick 
believe that Christ was risen / then Thomas that was 
longer in doubt. A man may rightly call him Fabius 
that with his advised taking of leisure / restored the 
matter: Although I speak not this as though 
winchester had not bolted out this case secretly 
with him self before hand (for he bolted it out long 
ago even to the bran out of doubt) but that running 
fair and softly / he would first with his painful study / 
pluck the matter out of the dark / although of 
it self it was found enough / but by Reason of 
sundry opinions / it was lapped up and made dark / 
and them did he debate it wittily to and fro / and 
so at last after long and great deliberation had in 
the matter because there is no better counselor than leisure 
and time / he would resolutely with his learned 
and consummate Judgment confirm it. 
Thou shouldest gentile reader esteem his censure 
and authority to be of more weighty credence / 
in as much as the matter was not rashly / and at all 
adventures / but with Judgment (as thou seize) 
and with wisdom examined and discussed: And 
this is no new example to be against the bishop of 
Rome. seeing that not only this man / but many 
men many times yea and right great learned men / before 
now have done the same / even in writing / wherein 
they both painted him out in his colours and made 
his sleets / falsehood / frauds / and deceitful wiles / 
openly known to the world. Therefore if thou 
at any time here to fore / have doubted ether of true 
obedience / or of the Kings majesties marriage / or 
title / ether else of the bishop of Rooms false pretended 
supremacy / as if thou had a good smelling 
nose and a sound Judgment / I think thou did 
not / yet having read over this oration / (which if 
thou favour the truth / and hate the tyranny of the 
B. of Rome / and his devilish fraudulent falsehood / 
shall doubtless wonderfully content the (throw 
down thine error / and acknowledge the truth / 
now freely offered the at length / considering with thy 
self / that it is better late to do so / then never to repent. 
Fare thou heartily well most gentle reader / 
and not only love this most valiant king of England 
and of France / who undoubtedly was by the 
providence of god / borne to defend the gospel / but 
also honour him and serve him most obedient: 
As for this winchester / who was long ago without 
doubt reputed among the greatest learned 
men / give him thy good word with Highest commendations. 
The end of bishop boners prologue. 
HEre before I have described to your grace / two 
of your false and dissembling bishops / to say 
steven gardener bishop of winchester / and Edmond 
Boner bishop of London. the third is dreaming Tunstall 
bishop of Durham / as plainly appears by his 
book of the sermon that he made before your noble 
father K. H. 8. on palm sunday. 1539. Wherein he also 
clearly confutes / the usurped poor of the bishops 
of Rooms authority / and here I will make rehearsal 
of perte of his sermon word for word as he caused 
it to be printed / which be these. 
What shall we say of those whom god has created 
to be subjects / commanding them by his 
word / to obey princes and governors? who not 
only do refuse to obey gods commandment / but contrary 
to his word / will be above there governors / 
in refusing to obey them / and further more will have 
there princes prostrate upon the ground / to whom they 
owe subjection / to Adore them by godly honour 
upon the earth / and to kiss there feet / as if they were 
god / where they be but wretched men / and yet they 
look that there princes should do it to them / and 
also all other Christen men / owing them no subjection / 
should of duty do the same. Do not these as you 
think follow the pride of lucifer there father? who 
make them selves fellows to god contrary to his 
word. but who I pray you be these / that men may 
know them? surely the bishops of Rome be those / 
whom I do mean. Who do exalt there seat above 
the stirs of god / and do ascend above the clouds 
and will be like to all mighty god.
And the bishop of Rome of late / to set 
forth his pestilent malice the more has allured to his 
purpose a subject of this Realm Rainold pole / come 
of a noble blood / and thereby the more arrant 
traitor / to go about from prince to prince / and 
from country to country stir them to war against this 
Realm / and to destroy the same / being his native 
country. Whose pestilent purpose / albeit it the princes 
that he brake it unto / have in much abomination / 
both for that the bishop of Rome (who being 
a bishop should procure peace) is a stirrer of war 
and because this most arrant and unkind traitor / 
is his minister / to so devilish a purpose / to destroy 
the country / that he was borne in: which any 
heathen man would abhor to do / but for all that 
with out shame he still goes one / exerting there 
unto all princes that will hear him. Who do abhor 
to see such unnaturalness in any man / as he 
shameless does set forwards / whose pernicious 
treasons / late secretly wrought against this realm 
have been by the work of almighty God / so 
marvelously detected / and by his own brother without 
looking therefore / so disclosed / and condign punishment 
ensued / that here after god willing / they 
shall not take any more such Rote / to the noyance 
of this Realm. And where as all nations of gentles / 
by reason and by law of nature / do prefer 
there country / before there parents / so that for there 
country / they will die against there parents being 
traitors / this pestilent man worse then a pagan / 
is not ashamed to destroy if he could his native
country. And whereas Curtius a heathen man / was 
content / for saving of the cite of Rome / where he 
was borne / to leap in to a gaping earth / which by 
the illusions of the devil / it was answered should 
not be shut / but that it must first have one. This 
perniscious man is content to rune headlong in to 
hell / so that thereby he may destroy his native country 
of England / being in that behalf in comparison 
worse then any pagan. And besides his pestilent 
treason / his unkindness against the kings Majesty / 
who brought him up of a child and promoted 
both him / and restored his blood being attainted / 
to be of the peers of this realm / and gave him money 
yearly out of his coffers / to find him honourably 
at study / makes his treason much more detestable 
to all the world / and him to be reputed more wild 
and cruel then any Tiger. But for all this thou 
english man / take good courage unto the / thou have 
god on thy side / who has given this realm to 
the generation of Englishmen / to every man in 
his degree / after the laws of the same / thou have 
A noble victorious and virtues king / hardy as allow / 
who will not suffer the to be so devoured / by such 
wild beasts: only take En english heart unto the / 
and mistrust not god but trust firmly in him. And 
surely the ruin intended against the / shall fall in 
there own necks that intend it. and fear not though 
the devil and his disciples be against the. for god 
they protector / is stronger then he and they / and 
shall by his grace give him and them a fall. 
All this with much more / be the very words of 
the said B. of Durrams sermon / preached before 
king h. 8. as in the said book / of his sermon appears 
more at large / the which I would desire your 
grace also to Read: And I would hope in god (after 
that) your grace would well know how to beware 
of these three false dissembling bishops / 
which have not only preached against the B. of Rooms 
usurped authority / but also caused the same to 
be printed for a perpetual memory where as now 
they rune with the world to the contrary. And as 
for doctor weston that bawdy ruffian of his shameless 
and abominable living / it is not unknown. 
And whether he were wont to go in memories 
and masks / among the merchants of London / 
he him self cannot deny it / or at the least his 
companions that were in his company at those times 
can testify. Is he meat to be A commissioner 
in matters of weight / or to be the prolocutor in 
the convocation house? who would think that 
our bishops / would suffer so vile a man / in such a 
Rome / if they had any honesty in them. for gods 
sake / beware of these false / crafty and dissembling 
bishops / least the hole realm come do destruction. 
Is not this A lamentable case / to mark 
how these false dissembling bishops in the time 
of your noble father / how earnestly / they both 
preached and wrote against the usurped pour of the 
bishops of Rome. And also against Cardinal Pole / 
calling him errant traitor and worse then a pagan / 
as before is rehearsed / for his unnaturalness 
against his own country / which god has given 
to the generation of Englishmen &c. And yet mark 
here these false traitors and dissemblers / their un / 
naturalness towered this noble Realm And now. 
even as evil and worse them they counted / Cardinal 
Dole / for they go about with out doubt / to 
bring this hole Realm of England in to the hands 
of strangers. 
Wherefore if your grace would call to remembrance 
what a great charge it is / to be the ruler 
of a Realm / you would never have followed so 
much your wicked bishops / who seek not your 
wealth / nor the wealth and quietness of the realm but 
to exalt there god the pope / which is for there private 
profit. Wherefore the prophet David saith in the 
2.psalm. be you wise therefore. oh you Kings / and learned 
you that be Judges of the earth / least the lord 
being angry with you / you perish from the right 
way / for be you assured that right sharpe Judgment 
and sore torment shall be done to them that 
are in authority as the wiseman saith. Remember 
how your pour commons assisted and helped you / 
when you were in your greatest / necessity and danger / 
with out whose help you had never come to the 
dignity / that you now be in: oh Remember them / 
and give them not over / in to the hands of your 
bishops and clergy / there enemies to be devoured 
and murdered. For there kingdom can never be 
established with out sheding of blood. I would your 
grace would be as good to them / whose blood your 
bishops seek (as you have been to strangers) and to 
banish them your Realm / and suffer them in a certain 
space to depart with bag and baggage / as you did 
the strangers / in the first year of your Reign. A lamentable 
case and if they have there wicked purpose / 
what shall follow / even there own destruction / 
and the destruction of the hole Realm. 
We have examples manifestly enough / what 
followed in the time of your predecessors / king henry 
the. 4. and 5. in whose time first those cruel acts 
were invented by the clergy / (which now be 
renewed) only to the destruction of noble men / and 
of a great sort of godly and learned men / which in 
those days suffered most cruel death / as the lord cobham / 
and many other knights and gentlemen / 
the thing is so plain that it cannot be denied / but 
what plagues followed thereof? was there not many 
fields fought within this realm / where were slain 
almost all the noble and gentile men / besides many 
thousands of the commons / as our own chronicles 
plainly declared? was not the clergy all the hole occasion 
of this / first by putting down the good king 
Richard the second and setting up .K.H. the .4. 
under whom / they made that most ungodly act / exofficio / and them because the kings and noble men / 
should not search for the knowledge of gods verity / 
set them in hand to claim titles / in France and 
other places and then likewise other noble men at 
home / ever to set them so a work / about wars 
and wordly matters / (like as they shortly will practise 
the same) except god shorten there time) and in 
the mean season that they might as they did 
then and now intend to do the same / burn and 
destroy all those that profess Christ and his verity / 
But it helped them as little as it helped the scribes 
and parishes in the time of Christ / when they had 
put Christ to death / they thought then that all had 
been well / and that he with his doctrine / had been 
suppressed but what followed / the third day he rose 
again from death as a valiant conqueror / and 
sent his holy sprite among his power apostles / 
who declared his will and gospel through out all 
the world / as it is manifest at this day / and after 
that sent Titus and Vespacianus the emperors / 
who utterly destroyed his enemies / and scattered 
them through the hole world where they be both hated 
and abhorred of all nations as it is afore said. 
This were a notable example and / lesson for your 
clergy / to make them beware how they / persecute 
Christ in his power members / but I fear me god 
has hardened there hearts / as he did the unhappy 
pashure and his fellows / and as he did the heart of 
king Pharaoh who for all the miracles and wonders / 
that god wrought before him by the hands 
of moses and Aaron / would not suffer the children 
of Israel gods elect people / to go out of his country / 
but plagued them the more / but what was his 
reward / was not he with all his host drowned 
in the read see? Even so what followed all the persecutions 
and wicked laws that they made / to keep 
gods verity under foot / what helped it them / did 
it not still the more flourish and Increase? And did 
not your noble father / in the parliament holden in 
the 25 year of his reign / at the supplication of the 
commons / in the said parliament / for these causes 
following / break the said most wicked law ex officio / 
which the wicked clergy had obtained in the 
said.2. year of K.H.the.4. That is to say? because 
the ordinary by virtue off that wicked law / 
might as they did upon there suggestion / arrest or 
Imprison any person or persons / whom they 
thought defamed or suspect of heresy / and them 
to keep in there prisons / till they were purged there 
of / or abjured / or committed to the lay pour to be burned / 
and yet in no part of the same wicked laws 
be declared any certain cases of heresy / so that 
the most expert and best learned men of the realm / 
diligently lying in wait / upon him self / can not 
avoid or eschew / the penalty of the said act / if he 
should be examined upon such captious interrogations / 
as it has been accustomed to be ministered by the 
ordinaries of this Realm / in cases where they will 
suspect any person of heresy: And over this forasmuch 
as it stands not with the right order of 
Justice nor good equity that any person should be 
convict or put to loss of his life / good name or 
goods / unless he were by due occasion and witness 
or by presentiment / verdict / confession / or process 
of outlawery &c. Wherefore it is not reasonable 
that any ordinary / by any suspection conceived of 
his own fantasy / with out due accusation or presentiment / 
should put any subject of this Realm 
in any infamy or slander of heresy / to the peril of 
life / lose of name or goods &c. This with much more 
is declared in the said statute of 25.H.8. Which 
was the occasion that the said most wicked law of exofficio / was broken. 
More over your said noble father perceived how 
many honest men in his time / were destroyed and 
murdered by his said clergy / as Johan hune / and 
many other honest men / which lived both quietly 
and honestly among there neighbours / this is so plain 
that they are not able to deny it. wherefore I 
most humbly beseech your grace to consider these 
things / for it is not enough for your grace to give 
over your pour and authority / to your wicked bishops 
and clergy / and so think to charge them 
and to discharge your self / nay not so? for every 
one shall bear his own burden as the holy apostle 
pronounced / and as gardener saith in his 
book de vera obediencia likewise / god has set 
you in authority / and it is you your self that shall 
give an account to a Judge that is above you / 
whose seat is the heaven / and the earth is his foot 
stole / the which by his holy word made all things / 
and by the same word shall destroy all Antichrists / 
which seeks the destruction of his kingdom / 
who dwelled in the light that no man can attain / 
whom no man has seen nor can see to him only 
be given all honour and glory for ever more.
Furthermore may it please you to know that 
the emperor and divers other princes and magistrates / 
have for the payment of a little money / suffered 
and does suffer the wicked Jews and also the cursed 
turks / to dwell savely in the countries and Cities / 
and to keep and hold there faith and ceremonies as 
they lift / with out any trouble or vexation for the same / 
and yet the same turks and Jews / so despise 
and abhor us Christians / a lake for pity / that there 
shall be more mercy and pity showed to / Jews and 
turks / them to us pour Christians / which do believe 
to be said only / by the death / and passion of our 
saviour Jesus Christ both god and man: Is 
not this also a lamentable case / that pour English 
men cannot be suffered to live quietly and in savety 
with out danger of there lives in there own countries / 
but must be forced to travel / and seek from 
country to country / where they may serve god quietly 
with a good conscience? oh that your grace would 
permit the first book of common prayer made in 
English in the time of your virtues brother K. E. 
vi. to be used to as many as would: unto the which 
book / all the hole clergy of the Realm did subscribe / 
and affirmed it to be good and catholic doctrine / 
yea they that now do persuade your grace to 
the contrary: And as for the English procession / 
what good and godly prays be therein / and how 
it was used to the great comfort and edifying / of 
as many as came to the church / to here it / all men 
can report / but that cannot your bishops and 
clergy now abide / because it shamed and condemned 
all there latin service / which is expressly 
against gods word / for s. Paul in the 14. chapter 
of the first epistle to the Corinthians / would have 
all things done to edifying / and would have .v. 
words spoken in the congregation / in a language
that they understood / rather them .x. M. words that 
they understood note: for saith he / how shall the unlearned 
say Amen / to thy blessing of thanks giving / 
when he wotith not what thou say / he cannot tell 
whether thou doest bless or course / and commanded 
plainly saying: they that speak in a language unknown / 
let them hold there peace in the congregation: read the 
said chapter / and you shall pertain the matter more 
plainly / whereby you or any Christian heart may be 
fiddled with godly Zeal against such Antichristians / 
which do so directly / against the holy apostles 
plain commandment. 
Now to make an end of this my supplication / 
I have read a godly example of the conversion of 
s. Paul / who being brought up from his youth 
at the feet of Gamaliell / being a pharize / of a Zeal 
that he had to maintain the pharizeeical doctrine 
of the pharisees became also a persecutor with the 
pharisees for a space / which pharisees / had wholly 
corrupted the law of god given by Moses. And as 
they had advanced there own traditions / devised 
by there robins / which both Christ and his apostles / 
commonly rebuked taught and preached there 
against / and therefore they slandered him and his 
apostles and never left persecuting of them / till they 
had murdered them: Even so our true preachers 
in these days / which have preached against the abuse 
both of praying / fasting / and also of allmose 
deeds (like as Christ him self did) our bishops 
persecute to the death / falsely believing them / saying / 
that they preached against prayer / fasting / and allmose 
dead &c. when they did preach / but only 
against the superstitious abuse / as there master 
Christ did / which preached against the abuse thereof / 
but the servant is not above his master and 
lord / for if they have called the lord of the house / 
beelzebub / how much more shall they call his household 
servants. Also like as the scribes and pharisees / 
falsely belied and slandered our saviour Christ / 
even so do our bishops and clergy / belie and slander 
our true preachers and prophets of gods 
holy word / when they preach not against the sacraments 
and ceremonies / but against idolatry counted 
a sacrament and the abuse of the ceremonies: 
for to write of the abuse of the sacraments and ceremonies 
a great book would scarcely suffice / and 
therefore I will turn again to my matter of the conversion 
of s. Paul / who (as I have said / of a Zeal 
that he had to the doctrine of the pharisees / persecuted 
Christ's pour members / and caused many 
to be bound and cast in to prison. But because he 
did it ignorantly / he obtained mercy as he him 
self confessed / not being worthy to be called an 
apostle because he persecuted the congregation 
of Jesus Christ &c. Even so I think that your grace 
does this ignorantly / that you have done / and being 
thereto persuaded by your false dissembling bishops 
and clergy: Whom now that your grace has 
warning / what they are: beware from hence forth 
that you follow there counsel no more in persecuting 
Christ's pour members / which have been the true 
preachers of his holy and blessed word / but do you 
as s. Paul did when he was called / And submit
your self / under the mighty hand of god / and turn 
to the lord our god who is able and will receive 
you to grace and mercy as he did .S. Paul / of you 
repent and do as he did / whereby you shall save your 
self and the whole Realm from Ruin and utter destruction. 
But if you will not submit your self under 
the mighty hand of god / and turn to the lord our 
god unfeignedly / and follow no more / the wicked 
counsel of your bloody bishops and clergy / in persecuting 
Christ's pour members / and will not receive 
and knowledge the time of your visitation. 
Then be you assured / that like as it happened to the 
Jews / for persecuting christ and his pour members / 
so shall it happen to you and the whole Realm / 
as in the beginning of this supplication is 
declared at large. The which I pray god defend 
if it be his holy will and pleasure / whom I beseech 
to open the eyes of your heart / that you may receive 
his word / and infallible verity / which may save 
your soul in the great day of the lord / whom I beseech 
to grant you grace thus to do / for his dear 
son Jesus Christ's sake amen.
