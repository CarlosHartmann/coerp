believe all the articles of the Christian faith. And thirdly,
that I should keep Gods holy will and commandments,
and walk in the same all the days of my life.

Question.
What do thou chiefly learn by these commandments?

Answer.
I learn two things: My duty towards god, and my
duty towards my neighbour.

Question.
What is thy duty towards god?

Answer. My duty towards God is, to believe in him. To fear
him. And to love him with all my heart, with all my mind,
with all my soul, and with all my strength. To worship
him. To give him thanks. To put my whole trust in
him. To call upon him. To honour his holy name and
 his word, and to serve him truly all the days of my life.

Question. What is thy duty towards thy neighbour?

Answer. My duty towards my neighbour is: to love him as
my self. And to do to all men as I would they should do
to me. To love, honour, and succour my father and mother.
To honour and obey the king and his ministers.
To submit myself to all my governors, teachers, spiritual
pastors, and masters. To order myself lowly
and reverently to all my betters. To hurt no body by
word nor deed. To be true and just in all my dealing.
To bear no malice nor hatred in my heart. To keep my
hands from picking and stealing, and my tongue from
evil speaking, lying, and slandering. To keep my body
in temperance, soberness, and chastity. Not to covet nor
desire other men's goods. But learn and labour
truly to get my own living, and to do my duty in
that state of life: unto which it shall please God to call me.

Question.
My good son, know this, that thou art not able to
do these things of thyself, nor to walk in the commandments
of God and to serve him, without his special
grace, which thou must learn at all times to call for by
diligent prayer. Let me hear therefore if thou can say
the Lords prayer.

Answer.
OUr father which art in heaven, hallowed be thyOUr father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy
name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be donename. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day ourin earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgivedaily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive
them that trespass against us. And lead us notthem that trespass against us. And lead us not
into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

Question.
What desire thou of God in this prayer?

Answer.
I desire my lord god our heavenly father, who is the giver
of all goodness to send his grace unto me, and to all people,
that we may worship him, serve him, and obey him,
as we ought to do. And I pray unto God, that he will
send us all things that be needful both for our souls
and bodies: And that he will be merciful unto us & forgive
us our sins: And that it will please him to save &
defend us in all dangers ghostly and bodily: And that
he will keep us from all sin and wickedness, & from our
ghostly enemy, and from everlasting death. And this I
trust he will do of his mercy and goodness, through our
lord Jesus Christ. And therefore I say, Amen. So be it.
