The life of JohnPicus
Earl of myrandula.
                  
JohanPicus of the father's side descended of
the worthy linage of the emperorConstantine
by a nephew of the saidemperor called
Pic9 by whom all the Ancestors of this JohanPicus
undoubtedlybear yt name. But we shall let his
ancestorspass to whom (though they were right
excellent) he gaveagain as much honour as he received.
and we shallspeak of him self rehearsing in
part his learning and his virtue. For these be the
things which we may account for our own of which
every man is more 
                     properly to be 9me~ded then of the
nobleness of his ancestors: whose honourmakes
usnothonourable. for either they were them self virtuous
or not: if not then had they none honourthen
self: had they never so great possessions: for honour
is the reward of virtue. And how may they 
                     claim
the reward ytproperlylongs to virtue: if they lack
the virtue yt the rewardlongs to. Then if themself had none honour how might they leave to their
heirs yt thing which they had not themself. on the
other side if they be virtuous and so consequentlyhonourable /
yet may they not leave their honour to us as
inheritance: no more then the 
                     virtue that them self
were honourable for. For never the more noble be we
for theirnobleness if ourselflack those things for
which they were noble. But rather the more worshipful
ytourancestors were the more vile and shameful
be we: if we decline from the steppes of their worshipful
living: the clear beauty of whosevirtuemakes
the dark spot of our vice the more evidently
to appear & to be the more marked. But Pic9 of whom
we speak was him self so honourable / for the greatplentious
abundance of all such virtues: the possession
whereof very honourfollows (as a shadow follows
a body) yt he was to all them yt aspire to honour
a very spectacle in whoseconditions as in a clearpolished
mirror they might behold in what points
very honourstands: whose marvelouscunning
& excellentvirtue though my rude learning be ferunable
sufficiently to express: yet for as much as if no man
should do it but he that might sufficiently do it: no
man should do it. and better it were to be unsufficiently
done then utterlyundone. I shalltherefore as I can
brieflyrehearse you his hole life: at the lest wise to
give some other man here after (ytcan do itbetter) occasion
to take hit in hand when hitshallhappily
grieve him to see the life of such an excellentcunning
man so feruncunninglywritten.

Of the wonder that appearedbefore his birth.before
                  
A Marvelous sight was there scenebefore his
birth. there appeared a fierygarlandstanding
over the chamber of his motherwhile she travelled
and suddenly vanished a way: which appearance
was peradventure a token that he which should that
hour in the company of mortal men be born: in the
perfection of understandingshould be like the perfect
figure of that round circle or garland and that his
excellent name should round 
                     about the circle of this
hole world be magnified whose mind shouldalways as
the fire aspire upward to heavenly thing. And whose
fiery eloquenceshould with an ardent heart in time to
come worship and praise almighty god with all his
strength. And as yt flame suddenlyvanished so should
this fire soon from the eyes of mortalpeople be hidden
we haveoftentimesread that such unknown and
strange tokens have gone before or follows the 
                     nativities
of excellent wise and virtuous men departing
(as it were and by god'scommandment)
severing the cradles of such specialchildrenfrom the
company of other of the commonsort. And showing yt
they be born to the achieving of some great thing.
But to passover other. The greatsaintambrose: a

Of his setting forth to school
and study in humanity.
                  
Under the rule and governance of hismother
he was set to masters & to learning: where
with so ardent mind he laboured the studies of humanity
that with in short while he was (and not with
out a cause) accountedamong the chieforators
and poetic of that time in learningmarvelously
swift and of so ready a wit that the verses which he

                     surelysurelyOf his study in Canone
                  
IN the fourteenyear of his age by the commandment
of his mother (which longed very
sore to have him priest) he departed to bolognia to
study in the laws of the church: which when he had
two year tasted perceiving that the facultyleaned
to no thing but only mere traditions & ordinances:
his mind fill from it. yet lost he not his time
there in for in that two year yet being a child he compiled
a breviary or a summaryupon all the decretals
in which as briefly as possible was he comprised
the effect of all ytwholegreat volume and made a book
no slender thing to right cunning & perfectdoctors.
Of his study in philosophy & divinity.
                  
After this as a desirous sercher of the secretes
of nature he left these commontrodden
paths and gave him self whole to speculation & philosophy
as well human as divine. For the purchasing
whereof (after the manner of Plato and Apollonius)
he scrupulously sought out / all the famous doctors
of his time. visiting studiously all the universities
and schools not only through Italy but also
thoroughfrance. And so infatigablelabourgave he
to those studies: that yet a child and beardless he was
both reputed: and was in deed both a perfectphilosopher
and a perfectdivine.
Of his mind and vaingloriousdisposition
at Rome.
                  
NOw had he been .vii. year 9uersaunte in these
studies whenfull of pride & desirous of glory
and man praise (for yet was he not kindled in ye
love of god) he went to rome & there (coveting to
make a show of his cunning & little considering how
greatenvy he shouldraiseagainst him self) ix.C. questions
he purposed. of diverse and sundrymatters.
as well in logic and philosophy as divinity. with
great study piked and sought out as well of the latin
actors as the greeks. And partly set out of the secret
mysteries of the hebrews / Caldaies / & Arabs.
and many thingsdrawnout of yeold obscure philosophy
of Pythagoras / trimegistus / and orpheus9 / &
many otherthings strange: and to all folk (except
right few special excellent men) before that day:
not unknownonly: but also unheard. of all which questions
in open places (that they might be to all people
yebetterknown) he fastened and set up. offering
alsohimself to bear the costs of all such as would
come thitherout of farcountries to dispute / but
thorough yeenvy of his maliciousenemies (which
envylike ye fire everdraws to ye highest) he could
never bring 
                     about to have a day to his disposition
appointed. For this cause he tarried at Rome an
wholeyear in all which time his envioursnever durst
openly with open disposition attempt him but rather
with craft and slight and as it were with privy
trenches enforced to 
                     underminehim for non
other cause but for malice and for they were (as many
men thought) corrupt with a pestilentenvy.
This envy as men denied was specially raised a
againsthim for this cause that were there where many
which had many years: some for glory: some for
covetuousness: given them self to learning: they thought
that itshouldhappily deface their fame & diminish
the opinion of their cunning if so young a man plenteous
of substance and greatdoctrine: durst in the
chiefcity of the world make orproof of his wit and
his learning as well in thingsnatural as in divinity
and in many such things as men many yearsnever
attained to. Now when they perceived that they
could not a against his cunning any thing openly
prevail: they brought forth the serpentines of false
crime. And cried out that there were .xiii. of his .ix.C.
questions suspect of heresy. Then joined they to
them some good simple folk that should of zeal to ye
faith and pretence of religionimpugn those questions
as new things. and with which their ears had
not be in yours. In which impugnation though some
of them happilylacked not good mind: yet lacked
they erudition and learning: which questions:
not withstandingbefore that / not a few famous doctors
of divinity had approved. as good and clean
and subscribed their names under them. But he not
bearing the loss of his fame made a defence for those
xiii. questions. A work of great erudition and elegant
and stuffed with the cognition of many things
worthy to be learned. which work he compiled in
xx. nights. In which itevidentlyappears: not only
that those conclusions were good and standing
with the faith: but also that they: which had barked
at them: were of folly and rudeness to be reproved.
which defence and all otherthings that he should
write: he 9mitted like a good christen man to ye most
holy judgment of our mother holy church. which
defence received: & the .xiii. questions duly by deliberation
examined: our holyfather ye pope approvedPic9
and tenderlyfavoured him. as by a bull of our holy
father pope Alexandra the .vi. it plainly appears:
but the book in which the hole .ix.C. questions with
their conclusions were contained (for as much as
there were in them many thingsstrange and not
fully declared and were more met for secret communication
of learned men then for open hearing of
commune people which for lake of conning might
take hurt thereby) Picus desired him self ytitshould
not be read. And so was the readingthereofforbidden.
Lo this end had Picus of his hiemind and
proud purpose. yt where he thought to havegotten
perpetualpraise: there had he much work to keep
him self upright: that he ran not in perpetualinfamy
and slander.

But as him self told his nephew he judged that
this came thus to pass: by the especialprovision

this falsecrimeuntruly put upon him by his evil
willers he should correct his very errors / and
that this should be to him (wandering in darkness)
as a shining light: in which he might behold & consider:
how fer he had gone out of yeway of truth.
For before this he had been both desirous of glory
and kindled in vainlove: and holden in voluptuous
use of women. The comeliness of his body
with the lovelyfavour of hisvisage / and there
with all his marvelous fame / his excellentlearning /
greatriches and noble kindred set many women
a fire on him. from the desire of whom he not abhorring
(the way of life set a side) was somewhat fallen
in to wantonness. But after that he was once with
this variance wakened he drew back his mind flowing
in riot and turned it to christ. women'sblandiments,

& despising the blast of vainglory which he before
desired / now with all his mind he began to seek the
glory and

HEre upon shortly the fame of his noble cunning
and excellent virtue both far & nigh
began gloriously to spring for which many worthy
philosophers (& that were taken in number of the most
cunning) resorted busilyunto him as to a market of
good doctrine. sum for to move questions and dispute /
sum (that were of more godly mind) to

good living: which lessons were so much the more

pleasure. to the fastening of good discipline in the
minds of the hearers those thingsseem to be of great
effect: which be both of their own nature good &

way of justice from te crooked & ragged path of voluptuous
living.

holy scripture.
                  
FRom henceforth he gave him self day & night
most fervently to the studies of scripture in
which he wrote many noble books: which welltestify
both his angelic wit / his ardent labour / and
his 
                     profounderudition of which books some we have
& some as an inestimabletreasure we have lost. Great

celerity he read them over / and wrote out what

of them that were unknow to him. but all thing as

bode such conflictsfarewell: and every day more and
more hated them. and so greatly abhorred them: that
when hercules estensis duke of ferrari: first by messengers

duke which very singularlyloved him he canthither
where he so behaved him self that was wonder to behold
how all yeaudiencerejoiced to here him for it
were not possible for a man to utterneither more cunning
nor more cunningly. But it was a commune

                     saying with him that such altercations were for a logition
and not meetly for a philosopher. he said also
that such disputationsgreatly
                     profited as were exercised
with a possiblemind to searching of the
truth in secretcompanywithoutgreataudience: but
he said that those disposition did great hurt: that were
held openly to the ostentation of learning & to win
the favour of the commonpeople & the commendation
of follies. he thought that utterlyitcouldunified
be but that with the desire of worship (which these
gazingdisputers gape after) there is with an inseparable
bond annexed ye appetite of his confusion &
rebuke whom they argue with. which appetite is a
deadly. wound to yesoul & a mortalpoison to charity
there was nothing passed him of those captionssubtleties
& cavillations of sophistry / nor a gainthere was
no thing yt he more hated & abhorred considering yt
they served of nought but to yeshaming of such other
folk as were in very science much betterlearned and
in those trifles ignorant. And ytuntosearching

word or twain generally. somemenhad shined

all the cognition of philosophy. Somemenhave
read the inventions of the oldphilosophers but he
had not been exercised in the new schools. Somemen
had sought cunning as well philosophy as divinity
for praise and vainglory and not for any profit or
increase of christ'schurch. But Picus all these things
with equal study had so received ytthey might
seem by hopes as a plentiousstream to haveflown
in to him. for he was not of the 9dition of some folk
(which to be excellent in one thing set allother aside)
but he in all sciences
                     profited so excellently: that which
of them so everyou had considered in himyouwould

Over all this: many times (which is not to be
kept secret) he gavealms of his own body:
we know many men which (as saintHierom saith)
put forth their hand to poorfolk: but with the pleasure
of ye flesh they be overcommon: but he: manydays
(and namely those days which represent untous ye
passion & death yt Christ suffered for our sake) bet and
scourgedhis own flesh in the remembrance of that
greatbenefit and for cleansing of his oldoffences.
Of his placability or benign nature.
                  
HE was of cheeralwaysmerry & so benign
nature yt he was nevertroubled with Anger &
he said ones to hisnephew that what so evershould
happen (fell therenever so greatmisadventure) he
couldnever as him thought be moved to wrath: but
if his chests perished in which his books lay: that he

much as he considered yt he laboured only for yelove
of god & 
                     profitof his church: & yt he had dedicate unto
him all his works/ his studies & his doings & since
he saw ytsince god is almighty they could not miscarry
but if it were either by his commandment or
by his sufferance: he verily trusted: since god is all
good: yt he would not suffer him to have that occasion
of heaviness. O very happymind which none adversity
mightoppress which no prosperity might enhance:
not the conning of all philosophy was able
to make himproud / not the knowledge of the hebrew /
chaldey & arabic language beside greek and
latin could make him vainglorious / not his great
substance/ not his noble bloodcould blow up his
heart / not yebeauty of his body / not yegreatoccasion of

should well know that he neither desired worship nor
worldly riches but rather set them at nought yt he
might ye more quietly give him self to study & yeservice
of god: this wise he 
                     persuaded/ yt to a philosopher
and him that seeks for wisdomit was no praise
to genderriches but to refuse them.

All praise of people and all earthly glory he reputed
utterly for nothing but in yerenaying
of this shadow of glory / he laboured for very glory /
which ever more followsvirtue as an unseparable
servant. he said that fame oftentimesdid hurt to
men while they live / & never good when they be dead.
so much only set he by his learning in how much he
knew that it was 
                     profitable to the church & to the extermination
of errors. And over that he was come
to that prick of perfect humility that he little forced
whether his works went outunder his own name
or not so that they might as muchprofit as if they
were givenoutunder his name. And now set he
little by any otherbookssaveonly the bible. in the only
study of which: he had appointed himself to spend
the residue of his life, saying that the commune profit
pricked him when he considered so many an so great
works as he had conceived and longtravailedupon

THe little affection of an old man or an old
woman to godward (wereitnever so small)
he set more by: then by all his ownknowledgeas well

hell or lift upin to heaven. wherefore he exhorted them
to turnup their minds to love god which was a
thing far excelling all the conning that is possible
for us in this life to obtain. The same thing also in
his book which he entitled de ente et lalightsomely
he treats where he interrupts ye course of his dissipation
and turning his words to Angel9Politianus

Albert9 his sisters son a young man both of wit cunning /
and conditions / excellent: began to comfort him
against death: & by natural reason to show him why
it was not to be feared but strongly to be taken: as yt
only thing which makes an end of all the labour /

life: he answered yt this was not the chief thing yt

the manifoldincommodities and

wretchedness of this life: but rather this cause should

After his death (and not long after) one hieronim9
a friarpreacher of ferrari a man as well
in cunning as 
                     holiness of living most famous. In
a sermon which he rehearsed in the chiefchurch of
all florence saidunto yepeople in this wise. O thou
City of florence I have a secret thing to showthee
which is as true as yegospel of saintJohn I would
have kept it secret but I am compelled to showit.
For he that hasauthority to command me has
bid me publishit. I suppose verily that there be
none of you but you knew JohanPicusearl of myrandula.
a man in whom god had heapedmanygreatgifts
and singular graces. the church had of him an inestimable
loss. for I suppose if he might have had
the space of his life prolongued: he shouldhave excelled
(by such works as he shouldhave left behind him) all
them that did this .viii.C. year before him. he was
wont to be conversant with me and to break to me
the secrets of his heart in which I perceived that he
was by privyinspiration called of god untoreligion.
wherefore he purposed oftentimes to obey this inspiration
and followhis calling. how be it not being
kind 
                     enough for so great benefices of god: or called
back by the tenderness of his flesh (as he was a man
of delicate complexion) he shrank from the labour / or
thinking happily yt the religion had no need of him
differedit for a time / how be it this I speak only
by 
                     conjecture. But for this delay I threatenedhim
two yeartogether: yt he would be punishedif he forslows
yt purpose which our lord had put in his
mind. & certainly I prayed to god my self (I will
not liethere fore) that he might be somewhatbeaten: to
compell him to take that way which god had from
aboveshowedhim. but I desired not this scourge upon
him yt he was beaten with: I looked not for that:
but ourlord had so decreed that he should forsake
this present life and leave a part of that noble crown
that he shouldhave had in heaven. Notwithstanding
ye most benignjudgehasdealt mercifully with him:
and for his plenteousalmsgivenout with a free
and liberal hand untopoorpeople & for the devout
prayers which he most instantly offeredunto god
this favour he had: though his soul be not yet in
the bosom of ourlord in the heavenlyjoy: yet is
it not on ytother side deputed unto
                     perpetualpain.
but he is adjudged for a while to ye fire of purgatory
there to sufferpain for a season. which I am ye gladder
to show you in this behalf: to the entente that they
which knew him: & such in especially as for his manifold
benefices are singularly be holden unto him:
shouldnow with their prayers alms / & othersufferages
help him. These things this holy man hierom
this servant of god openlyaffirmed. and also said
that he knew well if he lied in that place: he were worthy
eternaldamnation. And over yt he said yt he had
known all those things within a certain time. but
yewords which Picus had said in his sickness of ye
apprise of our lady caused him to doubt & to fear lest
Picus had be deceived by some illusion of yedevil.
in as much as the 
                     promise of our lady seemed to have
been frustrate by his death. but afterwards he understood
ytPicus was deceived in the equivocation of ye
word while she spoke of yeseconddeath & everlasting:
& he undertook her of ye first death & temporal. And after
this ye same hieromshowed to his acquaintance
ytPic9 had after his deathappearedunto him all 9paced
in fire & showedunto him yt he was such wise inpurgatory
punished for his negligence & his unkindness.
Now sinceit is so that he isadjudged to yt fire from
which he shallundoubtedlydepartuntoglory & no man
is sure how longitshall befirst: & maybe ye shorter
time for ourintercessions. Let everychristenbodyshow
theircharityupon him to help to speed him thither
whereafter yelonghabitation with yeinhabitants of
this dark world (to whom his goodly 9uersatio~ gave

venialoffences be cleansed) he may shortly (if he be not
all ready) enter ye inaccessible & infinite light of heaven
where he may in yepresence of yesovereigngodhood so
pray for us yt we may yeratherby his intercession be partners

unto his nephewJohanfrancis.
                  
Itappears by this epistle ytJohanfrancis
the nephew of Pic9 had broken his mindunto
Picus and had made him of council in some secret

                     godly purpose which he intended to take upon
him. but what this purpose should be: upon this letter
can we not fully perceive. Now after yt he thus
intended there fill unto him many impediments and
divers occasions which withstood his intent and in
mannerlet him & pulled him back. whereforePicus
comforted him in this epistle and exhorts him to 
                     perseverance.
by such means as are in the epistleevident
and plain
                     enough. Notwithstanding in yebeginning
of this letter where he saith that the flesh
shall (but if we take goodheed) make usdrunk
                     in
the cups of Circes and mishapus in to the likeness
and figure of brute beasts: those words if you
perceivethen not be in this wise understood. There
was sometime in. A woman called Circes
which by enchantment as virgilmakesmention
used with a drink to turn as many men: as received
it in to diverslikeness & figures of sundrybeasts.
some in to lions / some in to bears / some in to
swine / some in to wolfs which after ward walked
ever tame 
                     about her hows and waitedupon her in
such use or service as she lift to put unto them. In
like wise the flesh if it make usdrunk in the wine
of voluptuouspleasure or make the soulleave ye noble
use of his reason & inclineuntosensuality & affections
of the body: then yefleshchangesusfrom
the figure of reasonable men in to yelikeness of unreasonable

to ourownlikenessagain: unto the time we
have cast upagain the drink of the bodilyaffections
by which we were in to these figures enchanted.
when there comes some time a monstrous

to have a sight thereof. but I fear if menwould

and an insensibility for wonder when I begin in my
self: I knewneverwhether I shall say: to remember
or to sorrow / to marvel or to bewail the appetites
of men. or if I shall more plainlyspeak: ye very madness
not to believe the gospelwhosetruth the blood
of martiuscries yt voice of apostles sounds / miracles

                     proves / reason confirms / the worldtestifies / ye
elementsspeaks / devilsconfesses. But a far greater
madnessisit if thou doubt not but that the gospel
istrue: to live then as though thou doubtest

                     not but that it were false. For if these words of the
words of the gospel be true / ytitis very hard
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heavenwhy
do we daily then gape after the heapingup of riches.
And if this be true that we shouldseek for the glory
and praise not that comes of men but that comes
of god why do we then everhangupon the judgement
& opinion of men and no man reckonswhether
god like him or not. And if we surely believe yt ones
the time shall come in which ourlord shall say go
you cursed people in to ever lasting fire & again come
you my blessed childrenposedyou the kingdom that
hasbeen
                     prepared for you 
                     from the forming of the
worldwhy is there no thing then yt we lessfear then
hell or yt we less hope for / then the kingdom of god.
what shall we say ellis but that there be many christen
men in name but few in deed. But thou my son enforce
thy self to enter by yestraight gate ytleads to
heaven & take no heed what thing many men do: but
what thing yevary law of nature / what thing very reason
what thingourlordhim self shows ye to be done
for neitherthine glory shall beless if thou be happy with
few nor thy pain more easy if thou be wretched with
many. Thou shalt have .ii. specially effectual remedies

But over that certainly he shall not here the when

lightsomedarkness of contemplation not only 
                     presents
the mind to the father: but also uniteit with
him by unspeakableways which only they know that
haveassayed. Nor I care not how long or how short
thyprayer be / but how effectual how ardent / and rather
interrupted & broken between with sighs then
drawn on length with a continualrow & number

of this world / from

long to be acceptable to god if thou covett to be happy
at the last: let no daypass the but thou ones at ye

                     togethertogetherThe matter or argument of the epistle of
Picus to Andrew Corneus.
                  
THis Andrew a worshipful man and a especial
friend of Picus had by his lettersgiven
him counsel to leave the study of philosophy as
a thing in which he thought Pic9 to havespenttime
Enough and which: but if it were applied to yeuse
of someactualbusiness: he judged a thing vain & unprofitable.
wherefore he counselledPicus to surcease
of study and put himself with some of yegreat princes
of Italy. with whom (as this Andrew said) he
should be much more fruitfullyoccupiedthenalways
in the study & learning of philosophy to whom picus
answered as in this present epistle appearswhere he
saith 
                     these words (By this itshouldfollow that it
were eitherservile or at yeleastwise not precisely to make
the study of 
                     philosophy other then mercenary) thus
he means. Mercenary we call all those things
which we do for hire or reward. Then he wakesphilosophy
mercenary & usesit not as cunning but
as merchandise which studiesit not for pleasure
of itself: or for the instruction of his mind in mortal
virtue: but to applyit to such thingswhere he
may get some lucre or worldly advantage.

                     philosophyphilosophyJohanPicusearl of myrandula to andrew
Corneusgreeting.
                  
You exhort me by your litres to the civil and
active life saying that in vain: and in manner
to my rebuke & shame have I so long studied
in philosophy. But if I would at the last exercise
ytlearning in the entreating of some
                     profitableacts
and outward business. Certainly my wellbeloved andrew
I had cast a way both cost and labour of my
study: if I were so minded that I couldfind in my
heart in this matter to assentunto you and follow your
counsel. This is a very deadly and monstrous persuasion
which hasentered the minds of men: believing
that the studies of philosophy are of estates &
princes: either utterly not to be touched: or at least wise
with extreme lips to be sipped (and rather to yepomp
and ostentation of their wit then to the culture &
profit of their minds to be little & easily tasted. The
words of Neoptoleni9 they holdutterly for a sure
decree that philosophy is to be studied eithernever
or not long. but the sayings of wise men they repute
for Japes & very fables: that sure & steadfastfelicity
stands only in the goodness of the mind & that
these outwardthings of ye body or of fortune little
or nought pertainuntous. But here you will say to
me thus. I am content you study. 
                     but I wouldhave
you outwardly occupied also. 
                     And I desire you not
so to embrace martha that youshouldutterly forsake
Mary. Love them & use them both 
                     as well study as
worldly occupation. Truly my well-belovedfriend
in this point I gainsay you not. they that so do I
find no fault in. nor I blame them not. but certainly
it is not all one to say we do well if we do so: and
to say we do evil but if we do so. this is farout of
the way: to think that from contemplation to the active
living that is to say from the better to the worse
is none error to decline And to think that it were
shame to abidestill in the better and not decline.
Shall a man then be rebuked 
                     because that he desires
and ensuesvirtue only for itself: 
                     because he
studies ye mysteries of god: 
                     because he searches
the counsel of nature 
                     because he uses continually
this pleasant ease & rest: seeking none outward thing
despising all other thing: siththosethings are able
sufficiently to satisfy the desire of their followers. By
this reckoningit is a thing eitherservile or at ye lest
wise not princely to make ye study of wisdom other
then mercenary. who may well here this who may
sufferhit. Certainly he never studied for wisdom
which so studied therefore that in time to come either
he might not or would not studytherefore. this man rather
exercised the study of merchandise then of wisdom.
you writ unto me that hit is time for me now
to put my self in householdwith some of the great
princes of Italy but I see well yt as yet youhave not
known the opinion that philosophershave of them
self which (as horace said (repute then self kings of
kings: they loveliberty: they can not bear yeproud
manners of estates: they can not serve. They dwell
with them self and be content with the tranquillity
of their ownmindthey suffice them self & more /
they seek nothing out of them self: the things that
are had in honouramong ye 9mune people: among
them be not holden honourable. All that ever the voluptuous
desire of men thirsts for: or ambitionsighs
for: they set at nought and despise. which while
itbelongs to all men: yet undoubtedly it 
                     pertains
most properly to them whom fortune has so liberally
favoured that they may live not only well and
plentuously but also nobly. These great fortunes lift
up a man high and sets him out to the show: but often
times as a fierce and a skittishhorse they cast of
their master. certainly always they grieve and bear
him and rathertear him then bear him. The golden
mediocrity the mean estate is to be desired which
shall bearus as it were in hands more easily. which
shall obey us & not masterus. I thereforeabiding
firmly in this opinion: set more by my little house my
study / the pleasure of my books / ye rest and peace of
my mind: then by all your kingspalaces all your
communebusiness / all your glory. all the advantage
that youhawkafter. and all the favour of the court
Nor I like not for this fruit of my study yt I may
therebyhereafter be tossed in the flood and rambling
of your worldly busyness: but yt I may ones bring
forth the children that I travail on: yt I may give
out some books of mineown to the communeprofit
which may somewhatsavour: if not of cunning yet at
the lest wise of wit and diligence. And 
                     becauseyou
shall not think that my travail & diligence in study
is any thing remitted or flaked: I give you knowledge
yt after greatfervent labour with much watch
and infatiguabletravail I havelearned both the hebrew
language and the chaldey and now have I set
hand to overcome the greatdifficult of the Arab
tongue. These my dear
                     friend bethings: which to appertain
to a noble prince I haveever thought and
yet think. Fare you well. written at Paris the .xv.
