                  <lb/>
To The Christian and Considerate Reader: <lb/>
Grace, Mercy, &amp;c.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
AS to the Great Richness and Goodly Number <lb/>
of This Author's Writings, I shall not <lb/>
here say much; having spoken most of what <lb/>
I had to say anent Those two Points, in <lb/>
The Account or Preface set before the First <lb/>
Volume of His <normalised orig="Workes" auto="true">Works</normalised>, Printed in Folio <lb/>
the last year. And yet Thus much I shall <lb/>
say, That I am <normalised orig="dayly" auto="true">daily</normalised> more and more confirmed in my Judgement <lb/>
There passed upon them: being likewise <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> of This, That, <lb/>
though it be but the Addition of one Single <normalised orig="Unitie" auto="true">Unity</normalised> to the former <lb/>
Number of his <normalised orig="Bookes" auto="true">Books</normalised>; yet will it prove a <normalised orig="Multiplyed" auto="true">Multiplied</normalised> Accession <lb/>
of Degrees to the weight and excellency of them. <lb/>
I shall (perhaps) better <normalised orig="gratifie" auto="true">gratify</normalised> The Reader, if I can present <lb/>
unto his View any Observables worthy his Notice, Concerning <lb/>
the Method and References both of This present, and Those <lb/>
his other writings published in His Life-Time. And such as I <lb/>
think may be <normalised orig="usefull" auto="true">useful</normalised> do here follow. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">a</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
1. Of this Great Author's <normalised orig="Bookes" auto="true">Books</normalised> of Commentaries <lb/>
upon the Creed (with their Respective Appendices;) <lb/>
The Five First, (viz. The 1, 2, &amp; 3. Of the Eternal <lb/>
Truth of Scripture, &amp;c. The 4. Of Justifying <lb/>
Faith; The 5. Of the Original of <normalised orig="Unbeleif" auto="false">Unbelief</normalised>, <normalised orig="Misbeleif" auto="false">Misbelief</normalised>, <lb/>
&amp;c.) Relate unto, or Explicate the first Words <lb/>
of the First Article of the Creed.<lb/>
I <normalised orig="Beleive" auto="true">Believe</normalised> in God.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
2. His <normalised orig="Sixt" auto="true">Sixth</normalised> Book being A Treatise of the Divine <lb/>
Essence and Attributes; (to which append his Sermons <lb/>
upon 2. Chron. 6. 39. upon <normalised orig="Jeremie" auto="true">Jeremy</normalised> 26. 29. His <lb/>
Treatise of the <normalised orig="Signes" auto="true">Signs</normalised> of The Times: and his Sermon <lb/>
upon Luke 21. 1.) <normalised orig="Referres" auto="true">Refers</normalised> to the next words <lb/>
of The Creed. <lb/>
God, The Father <lb/>
Almighty maker of <lb/>
Heaven and Earth.<lb/>
Now, if any shall Object, That nigh the One Half of these <lb/>
(Treatises, and Sermons too) are about Divine Providence; <lb/>
of which there is no explicit mention in the Creed. The Answer <lb/>
is <normalised orig="readie" auto="true">ready</normalised> and <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised>; So they ought to be; it was meet and right they <lb/>
should be so. The Good God that made the world (with all the <lb/>
comely Ornaments and rich Furniture thereof) did neither leave <lb/>
it to it self, so soon as it was made, nor transmit the Tuition of it to <lb/>
a Guardian or Locum-Tenens; but ever did, and still <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> keep <lb/>
the Government in That Hand which with so great wisdom made <lb/>
the same. And His <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> Title NoValue; His Son our Saviour's <lb/>
Words [Pater meus adhuc operatur] teach us to depend upon, <lb/>
and trust unto his Constant Providence and support for Conservation; <lb/>
And This (as a Clew) leads, or, as a Terminus Communis, <lb/>
Couples, our Faith, to his Creative power. <lb/>
3. His Two Sermons, (the Former of them <normalised orig="Call'd" auto="true">Called</normalised> <lb/>
Bethlehem and Nazareth, upon <normalised orig="Jeremie" auto="true">Jeremy</normalised> 31. 22. The <lb/>
later upon Galat. 4. 4. <notvariant>enstyled</notvariant> <normalised orig="Mankinds" auto="false">Mankind's</normalised> Comfort <lb/>
from the weaker sex.) His Treatise, <normalised orig="entituled" auto="true">entitled</normalised> Christ's <lb/>
Answer to <normalised orig="Iohn's" auto="false">John's</normalised> Question; or, An Introduction to <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
the Knowledge of Christ. His 7. Book of Commentaries <lb/>
upon the Creed, <normalised orig="Call'd" auto="true">Called</normalised>, The Knowledge of <lb/>
Christ Jesus; Containing The Principles of Christian <lb/>
<normalised orig="Theologie" auto="true">Theology</normalised>, qua Talis, (Christ's Eternal Sonship; his <lb/>
Conception, Birth and Circumcision in the <normalised orig="Fulness" auto="true">Fullness</normalised> of <lb/>
Time, being, if not the <normalised orig="intire" auto="true">entire</normalised> Subject, yet the Main <lb/>
Scope of these last mentioned parcels) respectively <normalised orig="referre" auto="true">refer</normalised> <lb/>
to that Portion of The Creed wherein we avouch <lb/>
our Faith in The Son of God, our Lord <lb/>
Jesus Christ incarnate.<lb/>
And in Jesus Christ, <lb/>
his <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> Son, our <lb/>
Lord; which was <lb/>
Conceived by <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>the the</sic>
                     <corr>the</corr>

                  <lb/>
Holy Ghost, Born <lb/>
of the Virgin Mary.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
4. The Subject of this Great Author's Eighth <lb/>
Book of Commentaries upon the Apostles Creed, <lb/>
<notvariant>enstyled</notvariant>, The Humiliation of the Son of God, is the <lb/>
same God and our Lord, who was conceived by The <lb/>
Holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin Marie. And <lb/>
The Scope of it is to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised>, That <normalised orig="HEE" auto="true">HE</normalised>, according <lb/>
to the Scripture before Extant, <lb/>
Suffered under Pontius <lb/>
Pilatem was Crucified, <lb/>
Dead and Buried.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
5. His ninth Book, Of the Consecration of the <lb/>
Son of God to his Everlasting Priesthood; whereof <lb/>
His <normalised orig="Agonie" auto="true">Agony</normalised> and Bloody Death, His Rest in the Grave, <lb/>
(and in this Authors private opinion, see Book 8. <normalised orig="pag" auto="true">page</normalised>. <lb/>
385,) His <normalised orig="descension" auto="false">descencion</normalised> into Hell, His Resurrection and <lb/>
Ascension, were Respectively the several Giests or <lb/>
Moments, (some as preparations, others as Continuations; <lb/>
some as Accomplishments others as Consequents,) <lb/>
<normalised orig="Lookes" auto="true">Looks</normalised> back somewhat towards the former, <lb/>
and forward somewhat toward these Later particulars <lb/>
of the Creed. <lb/>
He descended into <lb/>
Hell, the third day <lb/>
he rose again from <lb/>
the Dead, he ascended into Heaven.<lb/>
6. All the Tracts or Books mentioned in the three last Paragraphs <lb/>
(for those be They, which Directly, Destinately, and Immediately <lb/>
treat of Christian <normalised orig="Theologie" auto="true">Theology</normalised>, qua Talis,) make but up <lb/>
The First and more <normalised orig="Easie" auto="true">Easy</normalised> Part of the Knowledge of Christ. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">a 2</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
And This (to use the Author's own words) Consists in the display <lb/>
of that most admirable <normalised orig="Harmonie" auto="true">Harmony</normalised>, which <normalised orig="ariseth" auto="true">arises</normalised> from the <lb/>
Concent of <normalised orig="Prophetical" auto="true">Prophetically</normalised> with Evangelical Writings; or, from the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Correspondencie" auto="true">Correspondency</normalised> of Parallels between Matters of Fact recorded <lb/>
in the Old Testament, and the Events answering in proportion <lb/>
to them, in the New. <lb/>
7 This Tenth Book (not published till now) is addressed to <lb/>
The Second part of The Knowledge of Christ, which Consists <lb/>
in the True Experimental Valuation of His <normalised orig="Vndertakings" auto="true">Undertakings</normalised> <lb/>
for mans Redemption: viz. Of His taking upon Himself the <lb/>
Form of a Servant, of His Death, Resurrection and Ascension. <lb/>
Of all which several steps or progresses of His O <normalised orig="Economie" auto="false">Economy</normalised> (as also <lb/>
of the whole Volume of His other whether Actings or Sufferings <lb/>
for us) The most precious Beneficial Effects and saving Influences <lb/>
are Actually and only Derived unto us by the Continued Acts and <lb/>
Constant Exercise of His Everlasting Priesthood, executed <normalised orig="dayly" auto="true">daily</normalised> <lb/>
in the Heavenly <normalised orig="Sanctuarie" auto="true">Sanctuary</normalised>, by Him there Sitting on <lb/>
the Right Hand of <normalised orig="Majestie" auto="true">Majesty</normalised> on High. <normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> plain <lb/>
then, that, That Part of this Tenth Book which explicitly <lb/>
<normalised orig="treates" auto="true">treats</normalised> of Christs Priesthood, as it supposes <lb/>
Christ Risen and ascended, so it relates specially to <lb/>
that portion of the Creed, <lb/>
And there he <normalised orig="sitteth" auto="true">sits</normalised> <lb/>
on the Right Hand of <lb/>
God the Father Almighty.<lb/>
8 This Glorious High-Priesthood of the Son of God, then, <lb/>
is The Office of Perfection; The completing, finishing, or Crowning <lb/>
office. That Office amongst us which <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> it's name from Finalis <lb/>
Concordia, is in no proportion so <normalised orig="usefull" auto="true">useful</normalised> for agreements or Atonements <lb/>
civil betwixt man and man, as This Transcendent Priesthood <lb/>
of Christ is Effectual, to all that sue to Him (with such Fervence <lb/>
and Reverence as he in the <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> of His Flesh did unto His <lb/>
Father) for Reconciling us mortal wretches unto God. <lb/>
9 And here now, besides what is said above of the great <normalised orig="Excellencie" auto="true">Excellency</normalised> <lb/>
of Christs Priesthood; The <normalised orig="Intertainment" auto="true">Entertainment</normalised> of three or four meditations <lb/>
(Homogeneal to this Subject, and which so Voluntarily offer <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
themselves as that I cannot reject them:) As 1. That Melchizedek <lb/>
King of Salem (probably Shem the Great, certainly Some person of <lb/>
Eminent <normalised orig="Pietie" auto="true">Piety</normalised> as well as <normalised orig="Dignitie" auto="true">Dignity</normalised>, An Ideal <normalised orig="patern" auto="true">pattern</normalised> of all perfections <lb/>
required in both the sons of <normalised orig="Oyle" auto="true">Oil</normalised>, King, and Priest; A <notvariant>Pater</notvariant> sui <lb/>
seculi, A Resemblance of the First Adam, but A most lively Type of <lb/>
Christ) Had the Priesthood <normalised orig="conveighd" auto="false">conveyed</normalised> unto him in some Signal <lb/>
Manner; so that Text <normalised orig="seemes" auto="true">seems</normalised> to imply, [And he was THE <lb/>
PRIEST of the Most High God.] 2. That Aaron, who <lb/>
was also a Type of Christ, did not take his Honour upon himself, <lb/>
but was most solemnly and satisfactorily called of God thereto, and <lb/>
stated (himself and his successors) therein. 3. That our Lord <lb/>
Jesus Christ, The Son, The Only Son of God, (and so by natural <lb/>
Inheritance <normalised orig="intituled" auto="true">entitled</normalised> to the Kingdom and Priesthood of the world) <lb/>
did not <normalised orig="glorifie" auto="true">glorify</normalised> himself to be made an High priest; but had, <lb/>
besides the immeasurable <normalised orig="Vnction" auto="true">Unction</normalised> of the Spirit, the Office founded <lb/>
upon him by A most Ample Patent: [In the Volume of the Book <lb/>
it is written -.] and invested in Him, and only in Him, by The <lb/>
word of the Oath of God. Hebr. 7. 20. &amp;c. <normalised orig="Doth" auto="true">Does</normalised> render <lb/>
me <normalised orig="wonder-strook" auto="false">wonder-struck</normalised> at four sorts of men most Active in this <normalised orig="Busie" auto="true">Busy</normalised> <lb/>
Age. 1. At such as think it a Piece of their <normalised orig="Christianitie" auto="true">Christianity</normalised> to loath <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>and and</sic>
                     <corr>and</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="despight" auto="true">despite</normalised> the Name of Priest, as of some pernicious vermin bred <lb/>
out of a Putrid Jewish <normalised orig="Carkass" auto="true">Carcase</normalised>; whereas it Signifies neither less <lb/>
nor more then a Person <normalised orig="intrusted" auto="true">entrusted</normalised> (and who is sufficient for that <lb/>
Thing!) with some part or Branch of Christs Priesthood which <lb/>
is here on earth to be managed and Executed for the Benefit of <lb/>
<normalised orig="mankinde" auto="true">mankind</normalised>, even of Him that so Hates the name. 2. That the <lb/>
Bishop of that <normalised orig="Antient" auto="true">Ancient</normalised> Sea <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised> should by <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> of such <lb/>
a <normalised orig="dimme" auto="true">dim</normalised> Commission as cannot be read without Spectacles of <lb/>
<normalised orig="Phansie" auto="true">Fancy</normalised> made at Rome, Grasp at All in gross, as if all Power, which <lb/>
Christ Himself <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not personally exercise in the Heavenly <normalised orig="Sacntuarie" auto="false">sanctuary</normalised>, <lb/>
was to pass and be derived by imposition or under the Signature <lb/>
of His Hand, and to be shared and dispensed at his discretion. <lb/>
3. That those our Brethren in Christ (if yet they will allow us <lb/>
to call them Brethren which have <normalised orig="welnigh" auto="true">well-nigh</normalised> given over to say <notvariant>Pater</notvariant> <lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
Noster) who so zealously hate Innovations, should, <normalised orig="contrarie" auto="true">contrary</normalised> to the <lb/>
Church-Practice of 15. Ages together, not only 1. take upon them to <lb/>
Ordain or commissionate men to execute part of Christs <normalised orig="Preisthood" auto="false">Priesthood</normalised>, <lb/>
and 2. to Censure offenders, without consent of that Order which <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> so fair a Patent to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised>, and so long Prescription, somewhile <lb/>
for the sole Power, <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> for the Main Stroke in Both; But <lb/>
even 3. to censure and excommunicate some Persons of that Order, <lb/>
and 4. the very Order it self (in submission to which (when time <lb/>
was) they seemed to us, to live with a good conscience, and in a comfortable <lb/>
Communion with their conforming Brethren) which <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
in effect proved, the cutting off that Goodly Bough whereof themselves <lb/>
were Branches: not considering, either how ill themselves  <lb/>
take it, when any thing by others is affirmed that contains in it but <lb/>
a Consequence which will condemn the Practise of the Reformed <lb/>
Churches of these two last Centuries; or How ill a <normalised orig="Physiognomie" auto="true">Physiognomy</normalised> the <lb/>
very outward Face of the Act caries, as of a Strife (managed even <lb/>
unto Blood) for <normalised orig="Cheif" auto="true">Chief</normalised> <normalised orig="Roomes" auto="true">Rooms</normalised> in Synagogues, who should be <lb/>
the greatest, or have the Greatest share in Exercising such parts of <lb/>
Christs Priesthood as be concredited to men; A thing flat <normalised orig="contrarie" auto="true">contrary</normalised> <lb/>
to the Precepts of Christ, and to the <normalised orig="humilitie" auto="true">humility</normalised> of a Christian, <lb/>
whose only strife is, to <normalised orig="preferre" auto="true">prefer</normalised> others in Honour before Himself, <lb/>
&amp; whose <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> Ambition is, to become like one of those little ones that <lb/>
are weaned from the Breast. 4. That the <normalised orig="volunteeres" auto="true">volunteers</normalised> of the People, <lb/>
who have improved the former Transgression of removing the Ancient <lb/>
Church-Marks which our fathers had set, (rather the Fathers <lb/>
themselves set for Land-marks and Guides) to a total Demolition; <lb/>
casting off the sons who had cast out their Fathers, and the <lb/>
Branches which had <normalised orig="pluckt" auto="true">plucked</normalised> up their own Roots, and so succeeding <lb/>
both as Augmenters and Revengers of the sin: especially that any which <lb/>
among them pretend to the Fear of God and Love our Great High-Priest, <lb/>
should not scruple at all, to execrate all consecration of Persons <lb/>
to serve in Christ's stead, and yet <normalised orig="Dubb" auto="true">Dub</normalised> themselves officers; <lb/>
when as, God <normalised orig="knowes" auto="true">knows</normalised>, they be as far from Abilities to discharge as <lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
they are from <normalised orig="Authoritie" auto="true">Authority</normalised> to undertake the duty. The <normalised orig="Catechizing" auto="true">Catechising</normalised> <lb/>
of their own children and servants in their own private Families, and <lb/>
whetting upon them the Confessed Duties of <normalised orig="Christianitie" auto="true">Christianity</normalised>, <normalised orig="Humblness" auto="false">Humbleness</normalised> <lb/>
of mind, Meekness of Spirit, <normalised orig="Puritie" auto="true">Purity</normalised> of Heart &amp;c. Being a task <lb/>
large enough for Better Qualifications then the common sort of men, <lb/>
generally Have. He that searches the hearts knows, This is not <lb/>
spoken out of <normalised orig="envie" auto="true">envy</normalised> at the people of God. I could wish, all of them <lb/>
were Prophets, and my self the most ignorant man in the world; (not <lb/>
that I would know less then I do, but have all others know more then <lb/>
my self.) The <normalised orig="sence" auto="true">sense</normalised> of my deep unworthiness, to be <normalised orig="numbred" auto="true">numbered</normalised> among <lb/>
those that have obtained a <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> &amp; lower part in the <normalised orig="Ministery" auto="true">Ministry</normalised>, works <lb/>
a remorse for <normalised orig="entring" auto="true">entering</normalised> (though by the right Door, yet,) so pr√¶propere <lb/>
into it: and expresses from me this profession, That if it were now <lb/>
to do, I should, <normalised orig="haply" auto="true">happily</normalised>, as Thales did in another case, either find my <lb/>
self too young a novice, or too old a Doater, to put my shoulders under so <lb/>
formidable (though honourable) a weight of trust and care. <lb/>
10. When I have besought three of those sorts concerned in these <lb/>
particulars, with all the <normalised orig="Humilitie" auto="true">Humility</normalised> and meekness their <normalised orig="charitie" auto="true">charity</normalised> can <normalised orig="imagin" auto="true">imagine</normalised> <lb/>
in a Dissenting Brother, and by the Bowels of mercy in our most <lb/>
Compassionate High-priest, Redire ad Cor, to take these things into <lb/>
serious thoughts, without prejudging their Conscience by any sinister <lb/>
considerations: and when I have made supplication to the Almighty, <lb/>
who Commanded light to shine out Darkness, That A Christian Reunion <lb/>
of hearts and minds may be the only Revenge and speedy Conclusion <lb/>
of all our Differings; I shall proceed to another observation, <lb/>
and <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> This. <lb/>
That the eternal God should fix such a Notable Seal upon Christs <lb/>
Priesthood as His Oath is; That Saint Paul should be so Copious <lb/>
and Demonstrative in the Argument as he is, And yet that there <lb/>
should be so little notice take of it by our Divines. I must profess both <lb/>
mine own ignorance in the Point, and mine unacquaintedness with our <lb/>
English writers to be such, that were I, at the writing hereof, Confined <lb/>
within a Circle till I had given in mine Answer to this Question, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">b</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
[What English Divine had first writt about Christ's Priesthood?] <lb/>
I must, to my knowledge, say, This <normalised orig="Authour" auto="true">Author</normalised>. <lb/>
From his former Book I had the first, and from This a <lb/>
more full discovery of the Excellent Mysteries and Comforts <lb/>
<normalised orig="conteined" auto="true">contained</normalised> in it. <lb/>
11. And though the wonder be the greater, that, there should be <lb/>
such a Vacuitie or silence (about this High Business) among those <lb/>
whose every third word, in their popular Discourses, is, The Lord <lb/>
<normalised orig="Iesus" auto="true">Jesus</normalised> Christ; who so profess the Knowledge of Christ, as if (the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Monopolie" auto="true">Monopoly</normalised> was <normalised orig="ingrossed" auto="true">engrossed</normalised> in their <normalised orig="Brests" auto="true">Breasts</normalised>) it was to <normalised orig="dye" auto="true">die</normalised> with them <lb/>
unless learned from them: Yet will it be much the less <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised>, <lb/>
when it shall be considered; That some of the Doctrines of later times, <lb/>
(Viz. That the Issues of life and death Everlasting are so <lb/>
past, decreed, and sealed from <normalised orig="Eternitie" auto="true">Eternity</normalised>, that no man ever <lb/>
had any <normalised orig="possibilitie" auto="true">possibility</normalised> to attain the Point opposite to that whereat <lb/>
he actually <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> arrive. That some <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised> be remitted, <lb/>
not only before they be repented of, but before they be <lb/>
Committed. &amp;c.) Do by certain, though perhaps unwitting <lb/>
Consequences, Render Christ's Priesthood useless and superfluous. <lb/>
For what need or use can there be imagined of an Office or Agencie <lb/>
to procure that which cannot but be? on to mediate for that, which <lb/>
is certainly, already dispatched? In such supposed predetermination, <lb/>
<normalised orig="Instrumentalitie" auto="false">Instrumentality</normalised> may have place, Officiation can have none. <lb/>
12. But supposing (what I wish) Every Reader as well, or <lb/>
better affected to, and more intelligent of the benefits of Christs priesthood, <lb/>
then the <notvariant>prefacer</notvariant> is, or the <normalised orig="Authour" auto="true">Author</normalised> himself was; Yet is this <lb/>
no <normalised orig="securitie" auto="true">security</normalised>, but Fault <normalised orig="wilbe" auto="true">will be</normalised> found with the <normalised orig="Authour" auto="true">Author</normalised>, for leading the <lb/>
Reader through a <normalised orig="wearie" auto="true">weary</normalised> Wilderness, rather then (per viam Compendij)
                  <lb/>
by the nearest avenue of Approach to the Throne of Our <lb/>
Most <normalised orig="Gratious" auto="true">Gracious</normalised> High-priest; by the long and <normalised orig="Thornie" auto="true">Thorny</normalised> <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> of <lb/>
Questions about Adam's First Estate, His Actual, our Original, <lb/>
Actual, and Habitual Sin, and Servitude thereto; about the <lb/>
poor pittance or Scantling of Freewill left us: of Mortification <lb/>
&amp;c. Let me pray such an One to Consider, That it was as impossible <lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
for the <normalised orig="Authour" auto="true">Author</normalised> fruitfully to display the Benefits of Christs Priesthood, <lb/>
before he had treated of Those Particulars, as it is for the reader <lb/>
to <normalised orig="obtaine" auto="true">obtain</normalised> those Benefits, which either Does not, or Cares not to <lb/>
understand his own need of them. They that be whole will sooner <lb/>
seek to the Physician, then he that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> no sense of the <normalised orig="venemous" auto="true">venomous</normalised> <lb/>
Taint, or Pestilential ulcer of sin Original (which more or less is upon <lb/>
the Body, or in the flesh of every mothers son, the purest Saint on Earth <lb/>
not excepted) will sue to Christ for Cleansing there-from. And yet is <lb/>
the daily washing of his feet. (Feet in the <normalised orig="fowlest" auto="true">foulest</normalised> <lb/>
sense) as <normalised orig="needfull" auto="true">needful</normalised> to him that walks the cleanest &amp; most <lb/>
Circumspectly upon the face of the Earth, as is his daily <lb/>
Bread. And it is our daily want of This Our most <lb/>
<normalised orig="Gratious" auto="true">Gracious</normalised> High-priests Office that (till we see him as He is) <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <lb/>
best Commend the precious benefits, (Blessing and washing &amp;c.) to be <lb/>
received at His hands. <lb/>
13. Well worth the labour, then, of this Great <normalised orig="Authour" auto="true">Author</normalised> it was, to <lb/>
spend the Five First Sections in handling those particulars, with purpose <lb/>
to make them a Fair Introduction to the Main Point, The <lb/>
Priesthood of Christ. And not to Dissemble with the Reader, perhaps <lb/>
He intended no more then Those Five for the Ingredients or <lb/>
<normalised orig="Consistencie" auto="false">Consistency</normalised> of the Tenth Book. Purposing to <normalised orig="subjoyn" auto="false">subjoin</normalised>, all, or most of those <lb/>
pieces which make up the <normalised orig="Sixt" auto="true">Sixth</normalised> Section (which be a <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised> of Elaborate <lb/>
and Choice Tracts) as an Appendix to, not as members of the <lb/>
Book. And I had once thought to have <normalised orig="Complyed" auto="true">Complied</normalised> with mine own apprehension <lb/>
of this intended Method, and put them in some place of <lb/>
<normalised orig="neutralitie" auto="true">neutrality</normalised> betwixt the Books; But when, upon Consideration, I found <lb/>
that this Disposal would prove confusive &amp; inconvenient to the reader, <lb/>
at least, to him that had not a more Methodical Head then my self, <lb/>
I resolved to place them as they now stand. And <normalised orig="truely" auto="true">truly</normalised> they fall in <lb/>
so orderly, and so Decently indent with the precedent and following <lb/>
Sections, that I repent me of nothing so much, in this work, as of some <lb/>
marginal notes (which by these presents I revoke) inspersed here and <lb/>
there by me, Timorous, (because I had the <normalised orig="Copie" auto="true">Copy</normalised> dropping and by <lb/>
Piece-meal) that the parts would not Symmetrize so well as I hope <lb/>
they will be found to Do. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">b 2</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
14. And this I think was agreeable (in the General) to the <normalised orig="Authours" auto="true">Authors</normalised> <lb/>
mind; who, if he had made only the five first Sections, the Constitutives <lb/>
of the 10. Book, and put what <normalised orig="concernes" auto="true">concerns</normalised> The Priesthood in <lb/>
the 11. or <normalised orig="elswhere" auto="true">elsewhere</normalised>, would probably have put them forth together; he <lb/>
having expressed himself to think it A Decorum that the Plaster <lb/>
should go along with the sore. And the rather so, because he intended <lb/>
(and he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been <normalised orig="ad√¶quate" auto="false">adequate</normalised> to his promise) to lance that festered <lb/>
wound (or Complication of wounds) of Human Nature, <lb/>
deeper then most others had done, which had treated, before him, <lb/>
of Sin Original, and Mans Servitude to Sin. <lb/>
15. This Preface <normalised orig="wilbe" auto="true">will be</normalised> grown <normalised orig="aboue" auto="true">above</normalised> the just stature of a Preface, <lb/>
when I shall have told the Reader these 4. Particulars. 1. That of the <lb/>
Tracts now published, divers were written 15; others, 30. &amp; more years <lb/>
ago. This will both give a reason why in some of them The old Translation <lb/>
is used; &amp; secure some passages at which otherwise offence might be <lb/>
taken; which he that shall now do (after he is told thus much) will Commend <lb/>
the Author by Falting him, &amp; enhance his words into the notion <lb/>
of <normalised orig="prophesie" auto="true">prophecy</normalised>. 2. That the reason why the Authors 4. 5. 6. &amp;c. Books <lb/>
were not printed in Sequence, is, because the owner of the Copies may <lb/>
not as yet, without great damage, either consent that another man should, <lb/>
or afford to do it Himself. So that we were <normalised orig="inforced" auto="true">enforced</normalised> to fall upon this <lb/>
Tenth; which may be more acceptable to the Reader, by being new, <lb/>
and no less beneficial, seeing He may serve himself of the Quarto ones, <lb/>
which, in the Interim, are parable. 3. And when God shall give <normalised orig="opportunitie" auto="true">opportunity</normalised> <lb/>
to print the Quarto's in this Volume, we must tell the Reader <lb/>
before hand, that the <normalised orig="sixt" auto="true">sixth</normalised> Book, of Divine Essence Attributes &amp; <lb/>
Providence, will not administer to him either the delight or the profit <lb/>
we intended, unless God move the hearts of them that have the MS. <normalised orig="Copie" auto="true">Copy</normalised> <lb/>
of the Treatise of Prodigies, or, Divine Forewarnings betokening <lb/>
Blood: (which certainly was perfected by the <normalised orig="Authour" auto="true">Author</normalised>, &amp; lent or <lb/>
lost in his life time) to produce it, that it may be <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>annnexed</sic>
                     <corr>annexed</corr>
                  </choice> to the <normalised orig="sixt" auto="true">sixth</normalised> <lb/>
Book, to which of due it <normalised orig="appertaines" auto="true">appertains</normalised>. The 4. Particular will give the <lb/>
Reader notice what Subject Matters he is to expect handled in the 11. <lb/>
Book. But before we name them, he must be reminded, that the <normalised orig="Authour" auto="true">Author</normalised> <lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
had in the 9. Book, come as <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> as the Article of Christ Ascension <lb/>
(reckoning Inclusive:) &amp; in the 39. Chapter of that Book, <lb/>
had <normalised orig="tackt" auto="true">tacked</normalised> That Article to the next of His Session at the Right-Hand <lb/>
of God. Now the respective Ends or Effects of Christs Ascension <lb/>
into heaven, and of His Session at the Right-Hand of <normalised orig="Majestie" auto="true">Majesty</normalised>, <lb/>
were some of them of Immediate (and if I may so say, of a Transient) <lb/>
dispatch: And such, I take it, were, His <normalised orig="prepareing" auto="true">preparing</normalised> a place for his <lb/>
Elect Ones; His Consecrating the heavenly <normalised orig="Sanctuarie" auto="true">Sanctuary</normalised>, and setting open <lb/>
the Kingdom of Heaven to all Believers, His sending the Holy Ghost <lb/>
in the Grace of comfort, &amp; Gifts of tongues, &amp;c. Some are of constant <lb/>
<normalised orig="Vse" auto="true">Use</normalised>, and continue in Esse unto this day, &amp; so shall unto the worlds end; <lb/>
as the Providential Government of His Church, and the rest of the <lb/>
world in order to the <normalised orig="affaires" auto="true">affairs</normalised> of his Church, which He administers as <lb/>
Lord; &amp; the Exercise of His Sacerdotal Office which he executes <lb/>
as Christ: &amp; some shall be manifested at the end of time &amp; of this <lb/>
<normalised orig="sinfull" auto="true">sinful</normalised> world, when He shall come in great power and Glory to Judge <lb/>
both quick &amp; dead. What this <normalised orig="Authour" auto="true">Author</normalised> <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> said upon any of these <lb/>
Heads, in his Books already printed, the Reader, if he will take the <lb/>
<normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> to search, may find. Of the following Generals (with their incident <lb/>
&amp; subordinate particulars) <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> the Eleventh Book treat. Of <lb/>
Christs Session at the Right-Hand of God; the Grammatical Sense <lb/>
of the words, &amp; the Real <normalised orig="Dignitie" auto="true">Dignity</normalised> answering to them, viz. The Exaltation <lb/>
of Christ. And whether He was exalted as the Son of God, or, <lb/>
as the Son of David. An excellent state of the question about <normalised orig="Ubiquitie" auto="true">Ubiquity</normalised>. <lb/>
Of Christs Lordship or Dominion. Of His <lb/>
Coming to Judgement. Of the Final Sentence to be <lb/>
awarded by Him to All. Of the Resurrection of the <lb/>
Dead. Of Life Everlasting (not the merit of man, <lb/>
but) the Gift of God; and Death the wages of sin. So <lb/>
that it is plain the Eleventh Book reflects upon, or resumes, <lb/>
the Article of Christs Sitting at the Right-Hand of <lb/>
God, and <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised> proceeds to the Next, and to the <lb/>
Two last. <lb/>
16. I Expect, the Intelligent Reader will Ask, where He may find <lb/>

                  <lb/>

Sins? I must <normalised orig="referr" auto="false">refer</normalised> the proposer of this rational question (which deserves <lb/>
a better answer then I can give it) to the Authors <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> words, <lb/>
[Which he may find in the first page of His Treatise Of The Holy Catholick Faith and <lb/>

17. I have yet Two things to recommend unto the Reader. The <lb/>
One I humbly present to the Consideration of the <normalised orig="Nobilitie" auto="true">Nobility</normalised> &amp; <normalised orig="Gentrie" auto="true">Gentry</normalised> <lb/>
of the Land, who have the Honour &amp; Blessing -- Longo Sanguine <lb/>

the Earth, &amp; <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> the Out-Burst of the spring, &amp; leave the Well to <lb/>
be digged by him that <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> to dwell upon the Plat) <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised>, page 19. <lb/>
&amp; 31. moved a <normalised orig="Querie" auto="false">Quarry</normalised> well worth their most exquisite indagation <lb/>
and pursuit. "<normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> This: whether Parents (of both sexes) may not, <lb/>
by frequent <normalised orig="voluntarie" auto="true">voluntary</normalised> Commission of some <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised>, improve the Corruption <lb/>
of nature in their Children, to an Height above the <normalised orig="ordinarie" auto="true">ordinary</normalised> <lb/>
Taint descending from Adam, or coming from Sin <normalised orig="meerely" auto="true">merely</normalised> Original, <lb/>
&amp; not intended by unnecessary affected actual or habitual <lb/>
Transgressing?" Would any of Them, now in this their <normalised orig="privacie" auto="true">privacy</normalised> or <lb/>
vacation, please, <normalised orig="Philosophari" auto="false">Philosophary</normalised>, to think upon it, and Commend their <lb/>
meditations to the world; they would be more acceptable and more imperative <lb/>
of practise, Coming from themselves, &amp; consequently be more <lb/>
Contributive to the Revival of virtue unto an Heroical Degree. <lb/>
18. The other is to those of the <normalised orig="Clergie" auto="true">Clergy</normalised> who teach the people Knowledge, <lb/>
&amp; for that end do seek acceptable words out of writings upright <lb/>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
and True; (as for the pretended <normalised orig="Favorites" auto="false">Favourites</normalised> of the Spirit, it is in vain <lb/>
to speak to them.) He that has Compassion on the poor ignorant multitude <lb/>
(even destroyed for lack of Knowledge of Principles contained <lb/>
in their Creed, Catechism &amp;c.) And a mind to tread in the Good <lb/>
Old way for the <normalised orig="√Üdification" auto="false">edification</normalised> of the poor of the Flock, may find in this <lb/>
Authors Works, matter, proper for every Dominical &amp; Festival <lb/>
through the year, especially for the special ones, that is, those that Commemorate <lb/>
the Great Benefits received by Christ. As also for occasions <lb/>
of <normalised orig="Administring" auto="true">Administering</normalised> Both Sacraments, marriages, Funerals, <lb/>
Fasts &amp;c. But let me tell him, The Gold (he is to find &amp; beat out) <lb/>
<normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> sometimes lie in so <normalised orig="smal" auto="true">small</normalised> a Compass, that unless he observe well, he <lb/>
may over-run it. For an Experiment, he may see 1 grain taken by me &amp; <lb/>
beaten out into divers Leaves. And for expounding Texts of Scripture, <lb/>
this Author seems to have a <normalised orig="felicitie" auto="true">felicity</normalised> not ordinary. Oft-times, when <lb/>
he pretends but to take One verse, he illuminates the Reader in the Epicycle <lb/>
of the Context, nay in the next <normalised orig="Orbe" auto="true">Orb</normalised>, I mean the Parallel, <lb/>
be it in the old or new Testament. But the Magisterium of his <normalised orig="excellencie" auto="true">excellency</normalised> <lb/>
is in <normalised orig="Christologie" auto="false">Christology</normalised>, in the display of the Mysteries of Christ, <lb/>
which he never thinks done, till he have <normalised orig="layd" auto="true">laid</normalised> the Type and shadow upon <lb/>
the substance, and the <normalised orig="Prophesie" auto="true">Prophecy</normalised> (as the Prophet did his Body) upon <lb/>
the Event, Face to Face, Hand to Hand, Part to Part, &amp;c. And <lb/>
his powerfulness in This <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> gotten him so deserved esteem amongst <lb/>
divers Learned men (though of different Judgment in some points) <lb/>
that in their works they have quoted him as An Author. <lb/>
19. What unworthy <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> my self have taken about the work, in <lb/>
the space of 6. or 7. Months, may be <normalised orig="summ'd" auto="true">summed</normalised> up in two lines. The <lb/>
<normalised orig="falts" auto="true">faults</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Presse" auto="true">Press</normalised> be few &amp; <normalised orig="smal" auto="true">small</normalised>, yet I am not only to be blamed for <lb/>
them, not undertaking more then to assist. Any Error in the notes, <lb/>
marginal or final, is to be imputed to my weakness. For the Authors <lb/>
Text, I have not in the least degree <normalised orig="alter'd" auto="true">altered</normalised>, intended, or remitted his <lb/>
sense, in any one Assertion, or point of Doctrine. But, which is the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Dutie" auto="true">Duty</normalised> of an Editour, have been Scrupulously <normalised orig="Carefull" auto="true">Careful</normalised> to deliver his <lb/>
Work as he left it &amp; meant it, not attending to gratify either mine <lb/>
own or the Readers opinions. <lb/>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
20. What Fate abides (either my self, or) this Orphan-Book, is <lb/>
only known to God. It is, of this Authors Works, for number, the Tenth, <lb/>
for bulk, larger then the most, for learning, Equal, &amp; for <normalised orig="Excellencie" auto="true">Excellency</normalised> <lb/>
of subject matter, superior to any of the other Nine: (for it is, Of the <lb/>
Knowledge of our selves Servants to sin: And of the Son of God, by <lb/>
the exercise of His Everlasting Priesthood, making us Free from sin.) <lb/>
And so in just Decorum, as it affords Royal Dainties, so it deserves <lb/>
the Choicest Patronage that any of his fellows had, even of such as <lb/>
have Right to Receive Tithes: yet seeing it so <normalised orig="fals" auto="true">false</normalised> out, by the ever to <lb/>
be Adored &amp; admired providence of God, that such it may not have <lb/>
now; It comes forth under the more Immediate Patronage of the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Almightie" auto="true">Almighty</normalised>, God the Father, the Word, &amp; the <normalised orig="Holie" auto="true">Holy</normalised> Spirit. Especially <lb/>
(I pray) under the most Auspicious shelter of Him whose Office <lb/>
it <normalised orig="describeth" auto="true">describes</normalised> &amp; <normalised orig="defendeth" auto="true">defends</normalised>, . The Apostle and High-Priest of our <lb/>
Profession, the Great <normalised orig="Shepheard" auto="true">Shepherd</normalised>, King, &amp; Bishop of our <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised>, Jesus <lb/>
Christ our Lord. He give it favour in the Eyes of the Reader, <lb/>
and prosper it to those Ends for which the Author writ it, and as <lb/>
the <notvariant>Prefacer</notvariant> <normalised orig="wisheth" auto="true">wishes</normalised> it: <lb/>
                  <lb/>

all those that share in <lb/>
His Office. <lb/>
