                  <lb/>
IN the last week of June, or the first of July, 1644. (in one of those <lb/>
two weeks I am <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised>) came forth my Answer (<normalised orig="entituled" auto="true">entitled</normalised> <lb/>
Antapologia) to the <normalised orig="Apologeticall" auto="true">Apologetical</normalised> Narration: Ever since which <lb/>
time I have forborne the <normalised orig="Presse" auto="true">Press</normalised>, out of an expectation of a Reply <lb/>
(which was with great confidence by many of the Independent <lb/>
party at <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> times given out I should have) with <lb/>
much patience passing by the many <normalised orig="reproachfull" auto="true">reproachful</normalised> <normalised orig="scornfull" auto="true">scornful</normalised> speeches and railings <lb/>
both in <normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> Sermons and printed Pamphlets, <lb/>
and many other <normalised orig="waies" auto="true">ways</normalised> cast upon me <lb/>
and my <normalised orig="Antapologie" auto="false">Antapology</normalised>: I was not willing to be <lb/>
provoked, or to trouble my self at the barking <lb/>
of every <normalised orig="dogge" auto="true">dog</normalised> (who according to <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised>, <lb/>
did bark at the Moon (<normalised orig="thats" auto="true">that's</normalised> all) but not <lb/>
hurt it: could <normalised orig="scoffe" auto="true">scoff</normalised> and jeer at the <normalised orig="Antapologie" auto="false">Antapology</normalised>, but knew not which way to go <lb/>
about to answer it) but rather resolved to reserve my time and strength, for <lb/>
some learned and solid Reply from the Apologists, or any other for them, to <lb/>
which I might have given a <normalised orig="Rejoynder" auto="true">Rejoinder</normalised>. But now eighteen <normalised orig="Moneths" auto="true">Months</normalised> being almost <lb/>
expired since the <normalised orig="Antapologie" auto="false">Antapology</normalised> came abroad into the world (time sufficient for five <lb/>
such eminent persons, or some other to have <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>retu*ned</sic>
                     <corr>returned</corr>
                  </choice> an Answer in, if ever they <lb/>
intended it) and now being without all hopes of any Reply from them (there <lb/>
being none in the <normalised orig="Presse" auto="true">Press</normalised>, as I can learn) but rather <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> given out by the Apologists <lb/>
themselves, and their <normalised orig="neerest" auto="true">nearest</normalised> friends, that for peace sake they <normalised orig="forbeare" auto="true">forbear</normalised> it (which <lb/>
let them <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> it that will, I do not) I shall <normalised orig="waite" auto="true">wait</normalised> no longer, but am resolved <lb/>
to appear again in <normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> against the <normalised orig="errours" auto="true">errors</normalised> of the time, and to set forth Tractates <lb/>
and Discourses upon such Subjects and Points, as I conceive may make most <lb/>
for the glory of God, the peace of this Church, and be most seasonable for the <lb/>
present necessity, be opus dies in die suo. I have all this while, out of <normalised orig="choise" auto="true">choice</normalised> and upon <lb/>
serious deliberation, declined the setting forth any Tractate of the Controversies <lb/>
of the time (although I have been by Learned men oft <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> upon, yea, <lb/>
earnestly <normalised orig="sollicited" auto="true">solicited</normalised> thereunto) lest the Apologists, or some other for them, should <lb/>
have taken occasion by answering that, to have some cloak and excuse for not <lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
replying to my Antapologia: but having given all this time, and finding by experience <lb/>
all their great words and threats of an Answer (both in print by <lb/>
Mr John Goodwin, yea the Apologists <lb/>
themselves in the Assembly, and <lb/>
many of their disciples (to be but <lb/>
<normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> flourishes and great swelling <lb/>
words of vanity) on purpose to feed <lb/>
their deluded Proselytes for the present <lb/>
(who called upon them for an <lb/>
Answer) I shall now <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> them <lb/>
more work, and <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised> many other <lb/>
Treatises to the former. And however <lb/>
upon the Reason before specified, <lb/>
I have been thus long silent, and <lb/>
discontinued the <normalised orig="Presse" auto="true">Press</normalised>; yet for <lb/>
hereafter, I do give it under my hand, <lb/>
that I will make amends, and redeem the time because the <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> are <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised>; promising <lb/>
(the grace of God enabling me, and sparing me life, health and liberty) <lb/>
that for this next year, or longer, as the troubles of the Church may continue, to <lb/>
be often setting forth one Tractate or other. I <normalised orig="aime" auto="true">aim</normalised> at, and shall endeavour to be <lb/>
like that tree spoken of in the Revelation, to <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic><normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised>*ld</sic>
                     <corr><normalised orig="yeeld" auto="true">yield</normalised></corr>
                  </choice> fruit every <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised>, and that <lb/>
the leaves of the tree may be for the healing of these Nations. Now to give <lb/>
some account to the Reader, of the nature of this following Discourse, and of <lb/>
my <normalised orig="seepe" auto="false">seep</normalised> therein; This present Treatise is not so much against any one <normalised orig="errour" auto="true">error</normalised> <lb/>
and sect, as against all I have heard of, a Discovery of, and Directions against that <lb/>
many headed monstrous Hydra of sectarisme sprung up in these times in England: <lb/>
a <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> and undertaking, which I well know and expect, will cause me <lb/>
all the hatred, envy and danger, which the cunning, malice, power or <normalised orig="blinde" auto="true">blind</normalised> <lb/>
zeal of all the <notvariant>sectaries</notvariant> in England can procure. Paul speaks in his Epistles to the <lb/>
Corinthians (among other troubles) of his fighting with beasts as Ephesus after the <lb/>
manner of <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>m*n</sic>
                     <corr>men</corr>
                  </choice>, 1.Cor. 15.32. and of a messenger of Satan sent to buffet him, <lb/>
2. Cor.cap.12. which were none of the least dangers and sufferings he met <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>, <lb/>
as will appear both by looking into the texts themselves, and consulting some <lb/>
learned Divines upon those Scriptures. Now in this present work, and some other <lb/>
following Tractates, something like to these I have to conflict with, namely, <lb/>
wilde beasts, grievous wolves, as the Scripture calls <normalised orig="hereticks" auto="true">heretics</normalised> and false Prophets, <lb/>
Mat.7.15. Acts 20.29. and with messengers of Satan, false Apostles, transforming <lb/>
themselves into the Apostles of Christ, 2.Cor.12.13. and <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> never the <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> hazardous <lb/>
nor difficult, that they are wolves in sheeps <normalised orig="cloathing" auto="true">clothing</normalised>, and Satan transformed <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
into an <normalised orig="Angell" auto="true">Angel</normalised> of light. Now for me, a poor weak <normalised orig="sinfull" auto="true">sinful</normalised> man, who have <lb/>
no <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> of flesh to back me, none of those relations to the great, Noble and <lb/>
mighty of the times, which many have, (in an age and time when truth is fallen, <lb/>
but <normalised orig="heresie" auto="true">heresy</normalised> and <normalised orig="errour" auto="true">error</normalised> prevails in all places, (cried up as new light, and as new <lb/>
truth,) yea, sectarisme is set up in places of honour and profit, and <notvariant>sectaries</notvariant> are <lb/>
delivered,) to appear in open field against, and to contend with them, is a hard <lb/>
and dangerous service. But I know whom I serve, and he who is with me, is <lb/>
stronger then they who are against me: and in this cause of God, his truth and <lb/>
all the reformed Churches, I fear not what man can do unto me. I well understand <lb/>
that I put my hand into a Hornets nest, and shall raise up against me all the <lb/>
spirit of separation, <normalised orig="schisme" auto="true">schism</normalised> and <normalised orig="errour" auto="true">error</normalised> <normalised orig="thorowout" auto="true">throughout</normalised> the <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised>, from the <lb/>
highest Seeker to the lowest Independent: but I value it not, jacta est alea (as Luther <lb/>
<normalised orig="spake" auto="true">spoke</normalised> upon a like occasion,) I can comfort my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> with that of David, <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. <lb/>
118. 12. <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 118.12">They compassed me about like Bees, they are <lb/>
quenched as the fire of thorns, but in the Name of the <lb/>
Lord I will cut them off.</quote> That God which delivered Paul from beasts as Ephesus, <lb/>
and from the messenger of Satan, that encouraged and enabled little David to <lb/>
fight with a Bear and a Lion and to pull a <normalised orig="Lambe" auto="true">Lamb</normalised> out the Lions mouth, yea to kill <lb/>
both the Lion and the Bear, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised>, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised>, and will preserve me till I have finished <lb/>
my testimony. Only my earnest desire is to the Orthodox and Pious Reader, <lb/>
that for the Lord Jesus Christs sake, and for the love of the Spirit, they would <lb/>
strive in prayer to God for me, that I might be delivered from unreasonable <lb/>
men, and from them that are <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>disobedien*</sic>
                     <corr>disobedient</corr>
                  </choice>; and that my service and labours in this <lb/>
<normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> may be accepted of the Saints, and that I may be so strengthened with <lb/>
might by his Spirit, that in zeal and <normalised orig="faithfullnesse" auto="true">faithfulness</normalised>, and yet in love, humility and <lb/>
<normalised orig="wisedom" auto="true">wisdom</normalised>, I may speak as I ought to speak in all my following Treatises. There <lb/>
are two things, amongst many, that I have oft thought upon, and observed both <lb/>
from the Scriptures and the works of holy men, both ancient and modern, <lb/>
which in this cause against the <notvariant>Sectaries</notvariant>, makes me not to be troubled at reproaches, <lb/>
<normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> reports, &amp;c. First, that those Ministers, who out of zeal to the glory of <lb/>
God, love of his truth, compassion to poor <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised>, have appeared and acted vigorously, <lb/>
by preaching and writing against the <normalised orig="errours" auto="true">errors</normalised> of the times and places they <lb/>
lived in, have still met with a great deal of malignity, hatred, reproaches, and <lb/>
speaking all manner of <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> against them falsely, as also many misconstructions, <lb/>
neglects and <normalised orig="unkinde" auto="true">unkind</normalised> dealings from friends. Secondly, Notwithstanding all this, <lb/>
they have gon on in their work and way, with <normalised orig="constancie" auto="true">constancy</normalised> and <normalised orig="heroick" auto="true">heroic</normalised> resolution, <lb/>
triumphing and <normalised orig="rejoycing" auto="true">rejoicing</normalised> in their sufferings, rather rising higher, and <lb/>
growing more bold, then being moved or discouraged: of both these I will give <lb/>
some instances: Christ the chief Shepherd and Bishop of our souls, for speaking <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">C</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
against the <notvariant>Sectaries</notvariant> of the time, namely the Pharisees, Sadduces and Herodians, <lb/>
was maligned, reproached, laid in wait for; as also his own Disciples, and Iobus, <lb/>
were sometimes offended at him, as Iob. 6.60.61, 66. Matth.9.14.15,16,17. <lb/>
and yet Christ endured contradiction of sinners, and bare <normalised orig="witnesse" auto="true">witness</normalised> to the truth. <lb/>
Paul for opposing false teachers, and the errors which had crept into the Church <lb/>
of Corinth and Galatia, met with great reproaches, <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> reports, not only from the <lb/>
false Apostles, but from many of the people, <normalised orig="insomuch" auto="true">inasmuch</normalised> as they counted Paul an <lb/>
enemy, passed judgement on him, and <normalised orig="spake" auto="true">spoke</normalised> contemptibly of him, Gal.4.16.17. <lb/>
2,Cor.10.10,11. 1 Cor.4.3.8,9,10'13.14. And yet Paul counted it a small thing <lb/>
to be judged, and could take pleasure in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, <lb/>
in distresses for Christssake, 2.Cor.12.10. and none of these things moved <lb/>
him, so he might finish his course with joy, and the Ministry which he received, <lb/>
to <normalised orig="testifie" auto="true">testify</normalised> the <normalised orig="Gospell" auto="true">Gospel</normalised> of the grace of God, Acts 20.24. Athanasius <lb/>
for opposing the Arians and detecting their <lb/>
<normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised>, was conspired against, accused and pursued with an unsupportable hatred; <lb/>
and yet he went on with great zeal and courage against the whole world, <lb/>
which at one time was made Arian, so that he was resembled by the Fathers to <lb/>
an Adamant, for his enduring all things. Augustine and Hierom, both of them, for <lb/>
preaching and writing against <normalised orig="hereticks" auto="true">heretics</normalised> and <normalised orig="schismaticks" auto="true">schismatics</normalised>, especially Donatists, <lb/>
suffered many reproaches, and yet <normalised orig="rejoyced" auto="true">rejoiced</normalised>, counting their sufferings a <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> of <lb/>
their greater glory; as <normalised orig="Hierome" auto="true">Jerome</normalised> writing to Augustine, <lb/>
congratulates Augustine for deserving the hatred <lb/>
of all <normalised orig="hereticks" auto="true">heretics</normalised>, which he <normalised orig="rejoyced" auto="true">rejoiced</normalised> was common to <lb/>
himself with him, and that which is an argument <lb/>
of the greater glory, all <normalised orig="hereticks" auto="true">heretics</normalised> do detest you, <lb/>
and persecute me also with the like hatred, that <lb/>
whom they cannot kill with swords, they do with <lb/>
wishes. Yea Augustine in opposing Pelagius <normalised orig="errours" auto="true">errors</normalised>, <lb/>
(Pelagius being a man of a strict life, and of great <lb/>
authority among all, having many famous men <lb/>
that adhered to him, as Calestius, Julianus Episcopus, <lb/>
Sulpitius Severus, and others,) was censured by <lb/>
some of his friends, to be too sharpe and bitter, and <lb/>
his writings had many misconstructions: There <lb/>
were Epistles by Prosper and Hilarie sent to Austin, <lb/>
wherein they <normalised orig="expresse" auto="true">express</normalised>, that many, who were most <lb/>
eminent in the honour of Priesthood, did reprehend <lb/>
Augustin, as if without a cause he had been too vehement, and had too sharply <lb/>
managed the <normalised orig="controversie" auto="true">controversy</normalised> against Pelagius; yea, among the <normalised orig="auditours" auto="true">auditors</normalised> of Augustine, <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
all did not <normalised orig="truely" auto="true">truly</normalised> and with a right hand receive it. <lb/>
Luther, as his name was <normalised orig="hatefull" auto="true">hateful</normalised> to the Papists, so also to the <notvariant>Sectaries</notvariant> of <lb/>
that age: Thomas Muncer, one of the first preachers and ringleaders <lb/>
of the Anabaptists (Luther having had some conflicts with <lb/>
him and others of that Sect) put forth some writings, wherein <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> did pour <lb/>
out his rage and fury against Luther, reproaching Luther, that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> wanted a <lb/>
spirit of Revelation, and savoured <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <normalised orig="carnall" auto="true">carnal</normalised> outward things; and after <lb/>
Luther had reproved Muncer for his opinion of liberty, <lb/>
and the <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> he went in, he set himself against <lb/>
Luther, <normalised orig="thundring" auto="true">thundering</normalised> out railing speeches, saying that <lb/>
Luther did equally offend as the Pope of Rome, yea that Luther was worse <lb/>
then the Pope himself, promulgating only a <normalised orig="carnall" auto="true">carnal</normalised> Gospel: but Luther all his <lb/>
<normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, both against the Papists and <notvariant>Sectaries</notvariant>, Swenckfeldians, Antinomians, Anabaptists, <lb/>
notwithstanding all reproaches, went on with courage and <normalised orig="rejoycing" auto="true">rejoicing</normalised>. <lb/>
Luther esteemed <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> speakings as meat <normalised orig="fatning" auto="false">fattening</normalised> <lb/>
him; Luther was afraid of praises, but <normalised orig="rejoyced" auto="true">rejoiced</normalised> <lb/>
in reproaches and blasphemies. <normalised orig="Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> enough to me, <lb/>
saith Luther, if I please Christ my Lord and his saints: <lb/>
I <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> from my heart <normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised> and give thanks to my <lb/>
God, that I am <normalised orig="hatefull" auto="true">hateful</normalised> to the <normalised orig="Divell" auto="true">Devil</normalised> and all his <lb/>
scales. I am certain (saith Luther) that the truth of God cannot be rightly <lb/>
handled and maintained without <normalised orig="envie" auto="true">envy</normalised> and danger; and this is the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> <lb/>
that it <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been rightly handled, if it offend; I do <lb/>
daily more and more please my self, and am proud <lb/>
that I see a <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> name increases to <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised>. <normalised orig="Zuinglius" auto="true">Zwinglius</normalised> <lb/>
that great leader of the Reformation in Helvetia, for disputing and writing <lb/>
against the Anabaptists, was by <normalised orig="Balthasar" auto="true">Balthazar</normalised> Hubmerus Pacimontanus (though <lb/>

thus of his hard usage and ill <normalised orig="requitall" auto="true">requital</normalised>, Certainly, if I <lb/>

Supper. Now for the first of these, namely reproaches, scorns, &amp;c. I do certainly <lb/>
expect and prepare; for <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 10.24-25">the disciple is not above his Master, nor the servant <lb/>
above his Lord: it is enough for the disciple that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> be as his Master</quote>, <lb/>
Matth. 10. 24,25. And what am I better then those learned Fathers, Augustine, <lb/>
Athanasius, and those first Reformers, Luther, <normalised orig="Zuinglius" auto="true">Zwinglius</normalised>, <notvariant>Calvin</notvariant>? <normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> <lb/>
honour enough for me to be somewhat like to them in sufferings. I have had <lb/>
some experience of the <notvariant>Sectaries</notvariant> malice, hatred, rage upon my former Books <lb/>
and Sermons that I have preached, and therefore know that this and other <lb/>
Tractates will inflame them. I am in my conscience fully <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised>, that this <lb/>
Tractate is at this time both seasonable and <normalised orig="usefull" auto="true">useful</normalised> in many respects, yea necessary, <lb/>
and that for all sorts of men, Magistrates, Ministers, people, both those <lb/>
that stand, and those that are fallen, yea the very <notvariant>Sectaries</notvariant> themselves, and in <lb/>
justice and all reason I might expect thanks and kind acceptance of my labour <lb/>
and pains. But I look that the <notvariant>Sectaries</notvariant> of all sorts will storm, and cast out <lb/>
of their <normalised orig="mouthes" auto="true">mouths</normalised> floads of calumnies, reproaches, both against my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> and <lb/>
book, besides all other <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> all the <normalised orig="mischiefe" auto="true">mischief</normalised> they can and dare; <lb/>
yea, I fear, that too many Brethren, partly through their relations to many <lb/>
<notvariant>Sectaries</notvariant>, and through that lukewarm temper (in reference to <normalised orig="errours" auto="true">errors</normalised> of <lb/>
<normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>) that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> long possessed them, who think every one too hot that appears <lb/>
against the Sects, will not so cordially approve this work. I can <normalised orig="truely" auto="true">truly</normalised> <lb/>
say, that in my former Books and Lectures I have been too much deserted, <lb/>
and not received those <normalised orig="incouragements" auto="true">encouragements</normalised> which many have done from Brethren <lb/>
upon like occasions: but none of these things move <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised>; not the <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised> of <lb/>

                  <lb/>
good name, not the unkind deserting of friends, neither count I my life dear <lb/>
to my self, so I may finish my course, and the ministry which I have received, <lb/>
to <normalised orig="testifie" auto="true">testify</normalised> the Gospel and the truth of God against the <normalised orig="errours" auto="true">errors</normalised> of the time. <lb/>
And as I know persecutions and afflictions abide <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> in this way; so it shall <lb/>
be my prayer and endeavour to follow the example of Christ, and those servants <lb/>
of his before named; and had I not long since set down, and counted <lb/>
my cost, giving up my name to God to take care of it, and my face to the <lb/>
smiters, I should not have thus appeared in writing and preaching: but I have, <lb/>
through the grace of Christ, learned to account it an honour to suffer for <lb/>
truth, and opposing <normalised orig="errours" auto="true">errors</normalised>, as well from <notvariant>Sectaries</notvariant>, as from Popish spirits: in <lb/>
this matter of opposing the present <normalised orig="errours" auto="true">errors</normalised>, I slight all the power, malice and <lb/>
<normalised orig="policie" auto="true">policy</normalised> of all the <notvariant>Sectaries</notvariant> in the <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised>. And I am resolved, by the grace <lb/>
of Christ, which <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> enabled <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> hitherto, to go on in a constant, <normalised orig="cheerfull" auto="true">cheerful</normalised> <lb/>
opposing and writing against the <normalised orig="errours" auto="true">errors</normalised>. I have <lb/>
determined with my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> to fear nothing in this <lb/>
cause, but to <normalised orig="contemn" auto="true">condemn</normalised> all things; yea, the higher <lb/>
the <normalised orig="errours" auto="true">errors</normalised> arise, and the more mighty they grow, <lb/>
the more to rise up against them: I value not my name, nor my life, if compared <lb/>
to the truth of Christ; but shall take pleasure in reproaches, necessities, <lb/>
sufferings in such a time as this, when few are valiant for the truth; no gold <lb/>
shall bribe me, nor preferments take me off; no lack of supplies shall dishearten <lb/>
me. I shall maintain this warfare at mine <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> charges, and this good <lb/>
cause cannot be starved for want of fees. And whatever can happen to <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> <lb/>
in this cause, I shall <normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised>, yea and will <normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised>, as <normalised orig="remembring" auto="true">remembering</normalised> those speeches <lb/>
of Christ, Joh. 18. <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 18.37">To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the World, <lb/>
that I should bear <normalised orig="witnesse" auto="true">witness</normalised> to the truth.</quote> Matth. 5.12. <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 5.12"><normalised orig="Rejoyce" auto="true">Rejoice</normalised> and be exceeding <lb/>
