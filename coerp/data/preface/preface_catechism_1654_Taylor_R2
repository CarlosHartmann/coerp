TO <lb/>
The Pious and Devout <lb/>
READER.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
IN this sad declension of <lb/>
Religion, the Seers who <lb/>
are appointed to be the <lb/>
Watchmen of the Church, cannot <lb/>
but observe that the Supplanters <lb/>
and Underminers are <lb/>
gone out, and are digging down <lb/>
the Foundations: and having <lb/>
<normalised orig="destroy'd" auto="true">destroyed</normalised> all <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Forms of <lb/>
Ecclesiastical Government, <normalised orig="discountenanc'd" auto="true">discountenanced</normalised> <lb/>

                  <lb/>
of Schism, by mingling all Sects, <lb/>
and giving countenance to that, <lb/>
against which all Power ought <lb/>
to stand upon their guard. There <lb/>
is now nothing left, but that we <lb/>
take care that men be Christians: <lb/>
For concerning the Ornament <lb/>
and Advantages of Religion, <lb/>
we cannot make that provision <lb/>
we desire; Incertis de salute, <lb/>
de gloria <normalised orig="minime" auto="true">minim</normalised> certandum: For <lb/>
since they, who have seen Jerusalem <lb/>
in prosperity, and have forgotten <lb/>
the order of the Morning <lb/>
and Evening Sacrifice, and the <lb/>
beauty of the Temple, will be <lb/>
tempted to neglect so excellent a <lb/>
ministration, &amp; their assembling <lb/>
themselves together for peace, <lb/>
and holy Offices, and be content <lb/>
with any thing that is brought to<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
them, though it be but the husks <lb/>
and acorns of Prodigals and <lb/>
Swine, so they may enjoy their <lb/>
Lands and their Money with it; <lb/>
we must now take care that the <lb/>
young men who were born in <lb/>
the Captivity, may be taught <lb/>
how to worship the God of Israel <lb/>
after the manner of their <lb/>
fore-fathers, till it shall please <lb/>
God that Religion shall return <lb/>
into the Land, and dwell safely <lb/>
and grow <choice ana="illegible">

                     <corr>prosperously</corr>

But never did the excellency <lb/>
of <normalised orig="Episcopall" auto="true">Episcopal</normalised> Government <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> <lb/>
so demonstratively and <lb/>
conspicuously as now: Under <lb/>
their conduct and order we had <lb/>
a Church so united, so orderly, <lb/>
so <normalised orig="govern'd" auto="true">governed</normalised>, a Religion so <normalised orig="setled" auto="true">settled</normalised>, <lb/>
Articles so true, sufficient, and <lb/>

                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="confess'd" auto="true">confessed</normalised>, Canons so prudent <lb/>
and so <normalised orig="obey'd" auto="true">obeyed</normalised>, Devotions so regular <lb/>
and constant, Sacraments <lb/>
so <normalised orig="adorn'd" auto="true">adorned</normalised> and <normalised orig="ministred" auto="true">ministered</normalised>, Churches <lb/>
so beauteous and religious, <lb/>
Circumstances of Religion so <lb/>
grave and prudent, so useful and <lb/>
apt for edification, that the enemies <lb/>
of our Church, who serve <lb/>
the Pope in all things, and Jesus <lb/>
Christ in some, who dare <lb/>
transgress an Institution and Ordinance <lb/>
of Christ, but dare not <lb/>
break a Canon of the Pope, did <lb/>
despair of prevailing against Us <lb/>
and Truth, and knew no hopes <lb/>
but by setting their faces against <lb/>
us to destroy this Government, <lb/>
and then they knew they should <lb/>
triumph without any enemy: <lb/>
So Balaam the son of Bosor was<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
sent for, to curse the people of <lb/>
the Lord, in hope that the son of <lb/>
Zippor might prevail against <lb/>
them that had long prospered <lb/>
under the conduct of Moses and <lb/>
Aaron. <lb/>
But now in stead of this excellency <lb/>
of Condition and Constitution <lb/>
of Religion, the people <lb/>
are fallen under the harrows and <lb/>
saws of impertinent and ignorant <lb/>
Preachers, who think all <lb/>
Religion is a Sermon, and all <lb/>
Sermons ought to be libels against <lb/>
Truth and old <normalised orig="Governours" auto="true">Governors</normalised>, <lb/>
and expound Chapters <lb/>
that the meaning may never be <lb/>
understood, and pray, that they <lb/>
may be thought able to talk, but <lb/>
not to hold their peace, they casting <lb/>
not to obtain any thing but <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 4</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
Wealth and Victory, Power and <lb/>
Plunder; and the people have <lb/>
<normalised orig="reap'd" auto="true">reaped</normalised> the fruits apt to grow upon <lb/>
such Crabstocks: they grow <lb/>
idle and false, hypocrites and <lb/>
careless, they deny themselves <lb/>
nothing that is pleasant, they despise <lb/>
Religion, forget Government; <lb/>
and some never think of <lb/>
Heaven; and they that do, think <lb/>
to go thither in such paths which <lb/>
all the ages of the Church did <lb/>
give men warning of, lest they <lb/>
should that way go to the Devil. <lb/>
But when men have <normalised orig="try'd" auto="true">tried</normalised> all <lb/>
that they can, it is to be <normalised orig="suppos'd" auto="true">supposed</normalised> <lb/>
they will return to the <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>excel*ency</sic>
                     <corr>excellency</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
and advantages of the Christian <lb/>
Religion, as it is taught by <lb/>
the Church of England; for by <lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
destroying it, no end can be <lb/>
<normalised orig="serv'd" auto="true">served</normalised> but of Sin and Folly, Faction, <lb/>
and Death eternal. For besides <lb/>
that, no Church that is enemy <lb/>
to this, does worship God <lb/>
in that truth of Propositions, in <lb/>
that unblameable and pious <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised>, <lb/>
and in preaching the necessities <lb/>
of holy life, so much as <lb/>
the Church of England does; <lb/>
besides this (I say) it cannot be <lb/>
persecuted by any <normalised orig="Governour" auto="true">Governor</normalised> <lb/>
that understands his own interest, <lb/>
unless he be <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>fi*st</sic>

                  </choice> <normalised orig="abus'd" auto="true">abused</normalised> by <lb/>
false Preachers, and then prefers <lb/>
his secret opinion before his <lb/>
<normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Advantage. For no <lb/>
Church in the World is so great <lb/>
a friend to Loyalty and Obedience, <lb/>
as she, and her Sisters of <lb/>
the same <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised>. They that <lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
hate Bishops have <normalised orig="destroy'd" auto="true">destroyed</normalised> <lb/>
Monarchy, and they that would <lb/>
erect an Ecclesiastical Monarchy, <lb/>
must consequently subject <lb/>
the Temporal to it. And both <lb/>
one and the other would be Supreme <lb/>
in Consciences; and they <lb/>
that govern there, with an opinion <lb/>
that in all things they <lb/>
ought to be attended to, will let <lb/>
their Prince govern others, so <lb/>
long as he will be <normalised orig="rul'd" auto="true">ruled</normalised> by them: <lb/>
And certainly, for a Prince to <lb/>
persecute the Protestant Religion, <lb/>
is as if a Physician should <lb/>
<normalised orig="endevour" auto="true">endeavour</normalised> to destroy all Medicaments, <lb/>
and Fathers kill their <lb/>
Sons, and the Master of Ceremonies <lb/>
destroy all Formalities <lb/>
and Courtships; and as if the <lb/>
Pope should root out all the <normalised orig="Ecclesiastick" auto="true">Ecclesiastic</normalised> <lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
State. Nothing so <lb/>
combines with Government, <lb/>
if it be of Gods appointment, <lb/>
as the Religion of the Church of <lb/>
England, because nothing does <lb/>
more adhere to the Word of <lb/>
God, and disregard the crafty advantages <lb/>
of the world. If any <lb/>
man shall not decline to try his <lb/>
Title by the Word of God, it is <lb/>
certain there is not in the world <lb/>
a better guard for it, then the true <lb/>
Protestant Religion, as it is <lb/>
taught in our Church. But let <lb/>
things be as it please God; it is <lb/>
certain, that in that day when <lb/>
Truth gets her Victory, in that <lb/>
day we shall prevail against all <lb/>
Gods enemies and ours, not in <lb/>
the purchases and perquisites of <lb/>
the world, but in the rewards <lb/>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
and returns of Holiness and Patience, <lb/>
and Faith and Charity; <lb/>
for by these we worship God, <lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>a*d</sic>
                     <corr>and</corr>
                  </choice> against this interest we cannot <lb/>
serve any thing else. <lb/>
In the mean time we must by <lb/>
all means secure the foundation, <lb/>
and take care that Religion may <lb/>
be <normalised orig="convey'd" auto="true">conveyed</normalised> in all its material <lb/>
parts, the same as it was, but <lb/>
by new and permitted instruments. <lb/>
For let us secure that our <lb/>
young men be good Christians, <lb/>
it is <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> to make them good <lb/>
Protestants, unless they be <normalised orig="abus'd" auto="true">abused</normalised> <lb/>
with prejudice, and suck <lb/>
<normalised orig="venome" auto="true">venom</normalised> with their milk; they <lb/>
cannot leave our Communion, <lb/>
till they have reason to reprove <lb/>
our Doctrine. <lb/>
There is therefore in the following <lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
pages a Compendium <lb/>
of what we are to Believe, what <lb/>
to Do, and what to Desire; It is <lb/>
indeed very little, but it is enough <lb/>
to begin with, and will <lb/>
serve all persons so long as they <lb/>
need milk, and not strong meat. <lb/>
And he that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> given the following <lb/>
Assistances to thee, desires <lb/>
to be even a door-keeper in <lb/>
Gods House, and to be a servant <lb/>
of the meanest of Gods servants, <lb/>
and thinks it a worthy <normalised orig="imployment" auto="true">employment</normalised> <lb/>
to teach the most ignorant, <lb/>
and make them to know <lb/>
Christ; though <choice ana="illegible">

rudiments of a holy Institution. <lb/>
This <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> he affirms, That <lb/>
there is more solid comfort and <lb/>
material support to a Christian <lb/>
spirit in one Article of Faith, in <lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
one period of the Lords Prayer, <lb/>
in one holy Lesson, then in all <lb/>
the disputes of impertinent people, <lb/>
who take more pains to <lb/>
prove there is a Purgatory, then <lb/>
to <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> men to avoid Hell: <lb/>
And that a plain Catechism can <lb/>
more instruct a soul, then the <lb/>
whole <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> prate which some <lb/>
daily spit forth, to bid men get <lb/>
Christ, and persecute his Servants. <lb/>
Christian Religion is admirable <lb/>
for its <normalised orig="wisdome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised>, for its <lb/>
simplicity; and he that presents <lb/>
the following papers to thee, designs <lb/>
to teach thee as the Church <lb/>
was taught in the early <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> of <lb/>
the Apostles. To believe the <lb/>

to the Soul of a <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised> <lb/>

if by my <normalised orig="Ministery" auto="true">Ministry</normalised> GOD <lb/>
