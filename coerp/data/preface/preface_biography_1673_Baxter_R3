            Christian Reader<lb/>
                  <lb/>
THE Love of Christ in his holy<lb/>
ones, and the great usefulness<lb/>
of such History, command<lb/>
me to take it as a pleasing office,<lb/>
to commend this real description of<lb/>
a Saint, to thy serious perusal and imitation.<lb/>
The good acceptance and success of<lb/>
the late published Life and death of<lb/>
Mr. Joseph Alleine, the more <normalised orig="encourageth" auto="true">encourages</normalised><lb/>
me to serve thee in this. As to the<lb/>
credit of the Narrative, let it be enough<lb/>
to tell thee, that his worthy Brother<lb/>
Mr. James Janeway (intimately acquainted<lb/>
with his most secret life) is the writer<lb/>
of it (I have no hand in it my<lb/>
self) And if thou live in or near London,<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 3</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
where he is now well known, I will not<lb/>
be beholden to thee to believe it; especially,<lb/>
if thou also know the other most<lb/>
credible arrestors. I know that many<lb/>
such Histories, <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> more what the writer<lb/>
could say, than what the Person was<lb/>
or did: But here both He and his Relations,<lb/>
and those whom he lived with,<lb/>
were all so near us, and are many of<lb/>
them yet so intimately known to me,<lb/>
and others, that there is no place for<lb/>
doubting left us.<lb/>
I confess such instances are very sad<lb/>
to my thoughts, while I am desiring<lb/>
the welfare of mankind on earth. To<lb/>
hear of the death of an Infant, who<lb/>
might have proved we know not what;<lb/>
or of an useless person, or of an aged<lb/>
Christian, who <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> profitably run<lb/>
out the course of nature, is nothing so<lb/>
sad to me, as to hear of the removal of<lb/>
such excellent young men, when they<lb/>
are prepared for their work, and just beginning<lb/>
it! But God is infinitely Wise,<lb/>
and Just, and more Merciful too than we<lb/>
can be. He <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> what he <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> and<lb/>
why; and is accountable to none about<lb/>
the measure of his benefits, nor the reasons<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
of his various disposals. But the<lb/>
great Judgements which since his death<lb/>
have befallen these Kingdoms, do <choice ana="illegible">

                  <lb/>
tell us that it is no wonder, if such men<lb/>
were taken from the evil to come, of<lb/>

And for himself, he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> run long<lb/>
enough who <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="toucht" auto="true">touched</normalised> the prize: He<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> failed long enough who is come safe<lb/>
to the harbour: And he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> lived long<lb/>
enough, who is readiest to die? Though<lb/>
I wonder at the <normalised orig="lengthning" auto="true">lengthening</normalised> of my own<lb/>
life, which that been <normalised orig="threatned" auto="true">threatened</normalised> by God<lb/>
and Man these thirty three years or more,<lb/>
yet, alas, how much less have I lived<lb/>
than this man did, who am yet far short<lb/>
of his Heavenly preparations? I am ashamed<lb/>
to read that any thing of mine was<lb/>
a help to his attainments, and to find<lb/>
that at almost sixty years of age, I am<lb/>
much below what he was raised to at<lb/>
twenty three. O that God would give<lb/>
my frozen age, such warm <normalised orig="reflexions" auto="false">reflections</normalised> from<lb/>
these his remains, that (according to my<lb/>
need) I may receive more from him that<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 4</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
is dead, than ever he did from me alive!<lb/>
If his own Reverend Father received so<lb/>
much from him, why may not I also have<lb/>
some <normalised orig="quickning" auto="true">quickening</normalised> even by the dead,<lb/>
through the fruits of the spirit left behind<lb/>
him, and the same spirits <normalised orig="quickning" auto="true">quickening</normalised><lb/>
influx upon me? And may I but so Die,<lb/>
how harmless, how welcome will Death<lb/>
be?<lb/>
We think it great pity, that he lived<lb/>
to preach but two <normalised orig="Semons" auto="false">Sermons</normalised> in the world!<lb/>
That some poor ignorant dull Congregation,<lb/>
had not been instructed and awakened<lb/>
by his Doctrine; and his spiritual<lb/>
fervour had not by dispersed writings, <normalised orig="enflamed" auto="true">inflamed</normalised><lb/>
the souls of thousands with the<lb/>
same Heavenly Love and Zeal. But who<lb/>
<normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> yet but that this one Narrative<lb/>
of his Holy exemplary Life and Death,<lb/>
may do as much as more numerous or Voluminous<lb/>
writings? The many Volumes<lb/>
of holy Lives, of <normalised orig="antient" auto="true">ancient</normalised> Doctors, Martyrs,<lb/>
and later Divines, Philosophers and<lb/>
others in Germany, England and other<lb/>
Lands, have done much good, and are<lb/>
still very useful, and a pleasant and profitable<lb/>
recreation, (O how much better<lb/>
than Play-books and Romances)! But<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
experience tells us, that God still <normalised orig="poureth" auto="true">pours</normalised><lb/>
forth as large measures of his spirit, as<lb/>
heretofore he did. If holy <normalised orig="Augustines" auto="true">Augustine's</normalised><lb/>
life, after so much pollution, and holy<lb/>
Hieroms life, qui fatetur <normalised orig="se" auto="true">see</normalised> non fuisse virginem,<lb/>
were so <normalised orig="laudible" auto="true">laudable</normalised> and exemplary;<lb/>
O how much praise do I owe to God, for<lb/>
his grace upon his Servants, who am<lb/>
yet acquainted with so great a number of<lb/>
holy laborious faithful Ministers, who I<lb/>
have great reason to believe, not only<lb/>
to have all their lives been free from all<lb/>
gross <normalised orig="heynous" auto="true">heinous</normalised> sins, but also to have laid<lb/>
out their zeal, their time, their labours,<lb/>
so sincerely and self-denyingly for God, and<lb/>
the good of souls, as that I cannot but<lb/>
hope that, if those who are against their<lb/>
Preaching of the Gospel, were but as well<lb/>
acquainted with them as I am, they<lb/>
would be their friends and forward to promote<lb/>
their work.<lb/>
I know one Temptation the Reader is<lb/>
like to meet with, to hinder his profiting<lb/>
by this example: Even to think that<lb/>
Mr. Alleine and Mr. Janeway by Overdoing<lb/>
did but cut short their own Lives;<lb/>
and that their excessive labours in meditation,<lb/>
prayer and other duties did deprive<lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
the Church of the benefit of much<lb/>
more, which they might have lived to do:<lb/>
and therefore that such examples are not<lb/>
to be imitated, but stand as <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>warning*</sic>
                     <corr>warnings</corr>
                  </choice> to<lb/>
us, not to overdo and destroy our bodies<lb/>
as they did. To which I answer, 1. I<lb/>
am one my self, that wish both of them<lb/>
had done somewhat less, in that part of<lb/>
duty which hurt the body, and overmatched<lb/>
their strength. And I am not <normalised orig="perswading" auto="true">persuading</normalised><lb/>
you, that every man must needs<lb/>
Preach as oft as Mr. Allen, or study and<lb/>
meditate as long as Mr. Janeway and he<lb/>
did: Men have their various capacities<lb/>
and opportunities, and works. 2. But<lb/>
yet I dare not charge either of them with<lb/>
sin: because I know not their particular<lb/>
motives. 3. And perhaps their lives had<lb/>
been as short if they had done less, as<lb/>
are the lives of many hundred Students,<lb/>
who favour themselves more than any<lb/>
wise man would wish. And it was Gods<lb/>
mercy that they who had but a short life<lb/>
to live, should do more than many that<lb/>
live to the period of natures course. And<lb/>
Methusalems life and theirs is equalled<lb/>
now. Whom have you known that by<lb/>
longer living, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> got more holy readiness<lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
to die? 4. But I beseech you distinguish<lb/>
well, between that part of their<lb/>
work, which was really like to overthrow<lb/>
their natures, and the rest which had no<lb/>
such tendency: and do not make the<lb/>
avoiding of the former a pretence, against<lb/>
your imitating of the later. It is not studying,<lb/>
meditating, praying, preaching,<lb/>
according to the measures of natures<lb/>
strength, that much <normalised orig="shortneth" auto="false">shortened</normalised> life. I think<lb/>
that Learned man wrote not foolishly,<lb/>
who <normalised orig="maintaineth" auto="true">maintains</normalised> that studies tend to long<lb/>
life? For my own part I was feeble before<lb/>
I was a hard Student: And studies<lb/>
have been a constant pleasure to me; And<lb/>
let any man judge whether constant pleasure<lb/>
tend to shorten any mans life? Indeed,<lb/>
that which <normalised orig="destroyeth" auto="true">destroys</normalised> the health of<lb/>
Students is, 1. The sedentariness of their<lb/>
lives, 2. And want of temperance or due<lb/>
care of their diet, 3. And want of sufficient<lb/>
cheerfulness, 4. And taking colds.<lb/>
Could Students but more imitate the labouring<lb/>
man, and take just hours and opportunities<lb/>
for bodily labour (not playful<lb/>
walks and exercises, that never warm and<lb/>
purge the blood), and did they eat and<lb/>
drink wisely, and live joyfully, and avoid<lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
colds, they might bestow the rest of their<lb/>
time in the hardest studies, with little<lb/>
hurt; (except here and there a melancholy<lb/>
or diseased man.) I doubt not but<lb/>
such narratives as this, will tempt many a<lb/>
slothful sensual Scholar, to indulge his<lb/>
sensuality as the wiser way; but at a dying<lb/>
hour he will find the difference. O what<lb/>
a comfort then is the review of a Holy,<lb/>
Heavenly well-spent life!<lb/>
I have oft thought what the Reason is<lb/>
that among the Papists, if the lives of<lb/>
their Saints be described in the highest<lb/>
strain, or their books have even unreasonable<lb/>
pretensions of devotion, even to<lb/>
the laying by of our understandings, or<lb/>
to a kind of Deification, (like Barbansons,<lb/>
Benedictus, de Benedictis, and divers<lb/>
others) it <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not offend men, but<lb/>
the vulgar themselves do glory in the sanctity<lb/>
of them. Whereas if with us a<lb/>
man rise higher in holiness, and in devote<lb/>
contemplation, yea or action, than others,<lb/>
he is presently the great eye-sore and obloquy<lb/>
of the world, I mean of the envious<lb/>
and ungodly part, which is too great.<lb/>
But the reason I perceive is, that among<lb/>
the Papists, to be a Religious man is to<lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
be a Perfectist who <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> more than is<lb/>
commanded him or is necessary to salvation;<lb/>
and so the people being <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>taugh*</sic>
                     <corr>taught</corr>
                  </choice> that<lb/>
they may be saved without being such<lb/>
themselves, their spleen is not stirred up<lb/>
against them, as the troubles of their<lb/>
Consciences peace; but they are <normalised orig="interessed" auto="true">interested</normalised><lb/>
in their honour, as being the honour<lb/>
of their way and Church: But with us<lb/>
men are taught that they must be Religious<lb/>
themselves in sincerity if ever they<lb/>
will be saved, and that without Holiness<lb/>
none shall see God, and that they<lb/>
are not sincere if they desire not to be perfect:<lb/>
And so they that will not be godly<lb/>
themselves, do think that the lives of<lb/>
the godly do condemn them.<lb/>
I write not this to cast any disgrace on<lb/>
the true History of any holy <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> lives:<lb/>
Nor shall it ever be my employment to<lb/>
reproach or hide Gods Graces in any, nor<lb/>
to make men believe that they are<lb/>
worse than they are. Whoever revile<lb/>
me for it, I will <normalised orig="magnifie" auto="true">magnify</normalised> and love<lb/>
that of God which <normalised orig="appeareth" auto="true">appears</normalised> in any<lb/>
of his servants, of any sect or party whatsoever.<lb/>
When I read such writings as<lb/>
old Gerson, Guil. Parisiensis, and divers<lb/>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
others, and such as Jos. Acosta and some<lb/>
other Jesuits, and such lives as Nerius's<lb/>
and Mr. de Reuti's, &amp;c. I cannot but think<lb/>
that they had the spirit of God, and the<lb/>
more do I hate all those mischievous engines,<lb/>
additions and singularities, which<lb/>
divide so many Christians in the world,<lb/>
who have the same spirit, and will not<lb/>
suffer us to hold the unity of the spirit in<lb/>
the bond of peace. O this unhappy pretended<lb/>
Wisdom, and <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>Oxthodoxness</sic>
                     <corr>Orthodoxness</corr>
                  </choice> in the<lb/>
holding of our several opinions, is the<lb/>
knowledge that <normalised orig="puffeth" auto="true">puffs</normalised> up, and <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> bred<lb/>
the pernicious tympanite of the Church,<lb/>
when it is Charity that <normalised orig="edifieth" auto="false">edified</normalised> it; And<lb/>
the more men glory in their dogmatical<lb/>
knowledge, to the contempt and hurt of<lb/>
such as differ from them, the less they<lb/>
know as they ought to know. And if<lb/>
any man have knowledge enough to<lb/>
kindle in his soul the Love of God, the<lb/>
same is known and loved of God, and<lb/>
then he will prove that wise man indeed,<lb/>
at death and to Eternity, I Cor 8.1, 2, 3.<lb/>
Reader, Learn by this History to place<lb/>
thy Religion in love and praise, and a<lb/>
heavenly life. Learn to keep such communion<lb/>
with God, and to find such employment<lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
with thy heart by meditation,<lb/>
as thy strength, and opportunity, and other<lb/>
duties will allow thee: (for I urge thee<lb/>
to no more) Learn hence to thirst after<lb/>
the good of souls, and to fill up thy<lb/>
hours with fruitful duty! And O that<lb/>
we could here learn the hardest lesson, to<lb/>
get above the love of life, and to overcome<lb/>
the fears of death, and to long to<lb/>
see the glory of Christ, and triumphantly<lb/>
to pass by Joy to Joy. O blessed world<lb/>
of holy spirits! whose nature, and work,<lb/>
and happiness is Love: Not Love of Carnal-self,<lb/>
and Interest, and Parties, which<lb/>
here <normalised orig="maketh" auto="true">makes</normalised> those seek our <normalised orig="distruction" auto="true">destruction</normalised><lb/>
most, who have the highest esteem of our<lb/>
knowledge and sincerity (as thinking our<lb/>
dissent will most effectually cross their<lb/>
partial Interests): But the Love of God<lb/>
in Himself and in his Saints, checked by no<lb/>
sin; hindered by no distance, darkness,<lb/>
deadness or disaffection: diverted by<lb/>
no carnal worldly baits; tempted by no<lb/>
persecutions or afflictions; damped by no<lb/>
fears of death, nor of any <normalised orig="decaies" auto="true">decays</normalised> or cessation<lb/>
through Eternity. To teach me<lb/>
better how to live and die, in Faith,<lb/>
Hope and Love, is that for which I read<lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
this narrative; and that thou <normalised orig="maist" auto="false">may</normalised> learn<lb/>
the same is the end of my commending it<lb/>
to thee! The Lord teach it effectually to<lb/>
thee and me. Amen.<lb/>
