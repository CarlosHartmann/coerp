               <head>THE <lb/>
PREFACE.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
THE Catechism of the Church is <lb/>
so clear, and comprehensive, as to <lb/>
want neither Exposition, nor Enlargement: <lb/>
However, to make it the fitter <lb/>
to attend upon the <normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised> Service of God, <lb/>
in a large Congregation; I have (with entire <lb/>
submission to my <normalised orig="Superiours" auto="true">Superiors</normalised>) taken the <lb/>
liberty to publish it with Three Improvements: <lb/>
(if I may so call them) 1. By dividing <lb/>
it into proportionable Sections, for the <lb/>
dispatching of the whole in a convenient Period <lb/>
of time: 2. By confirming all the Branches <lb/>
of it with Scriptural Proofs: And 3. <lb/>
By explaining more fully some parts of it, <lb/>
and especially the Articles of the Creed; <lb/>
and that these Additions may not seem to <lb/>
claim an equal rank with the rest, they are <lb/>
printed in a distinct Character. I know, the <lb/>
Catechism <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been attended so often <lb/>
within these few Years, with useful Enlargements <lb/>
from several hands; that to come <lb/>
after them with such a slight performance, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
may be counted a mean undertaking: But <lb/>
having a particular design to pursue, which <lb/>
none of those did exactly answer; (some <lb/>
being too copious, and elaborate, and the rest <lb/>
not suiting perfectly with my Scheme) I <lb/>
have <normalised orig="ventur'd" auto="true">ventured</normalised> upon a new Model, for the use <lb/>
of the Parish committed to my trust: In <lb/>
which I was desirous (according to my duty) <lb/>
to settle an <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> Method of <normalised orig="Catechizing" auto="true">Catechising</normalised> upon <lb/>
every Lord's day, in the time of Divine <lb/>
Service; as hoping then to do it with the <lb/>
greatest success. <lb/>
For this reason I have divided the Work <lb/>
into XII Portions of such a moderate compass, <lb/>
as that one of them may without trouble <lb/>
be <normalised orig="finish'd" auto="true">finished</normalised> at a time; and the whole in <lb/>
a Circle of Three Months: And by such an <lb/>
instructive variety of Matter, there will be <lb/>
no fear (I presume) of tiring the Congregation. <lb/>
If it be thought, that some of the <lb/>
Sections are made of an inconvenient <lb/>
length, by multiplying the Proofs, and lay too <lb/>
heavy a <normalised orig="burthen" auto="true">burden</normalised> upon the young learners; the <lb/>
Affair may be thus <normalised orig="order'd" auto="true">ordered</normalised>, at the discretion <lb/>
of the Catechist: I have upon no Head exceeded <lb/>
the number of Four Proofs; and <lb/>
when there is such choice, upon the first going <lb/>
over of the Catchism, the first Proof <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
may be given; and at the second time the <lb/>
second, and so on, where the number will <lb/>
bear it: By which means they may all be dispatched <lb/>
in a Year, and the Children may <lb/>
have nothing <normalised orig="impos'd" auto="true">imposed</normalised> upon them above their <lb/>
capacities: And both they, and the whole Congregation <lb/>
may be much <normalised orig="edify'd" auto="true">edified</normalised> by the customary <lb/>
use of so many necessary Lessons from <lb/>
the Holy Scripture: and when any one of the <lb/>
Proofs to a Branch is <normalised orig="publickly" auto="true">publicly</normalised> repeated, they <lb/>
who look upon the Catechism, may have the <lb/>
rest in their Eye, and be able to treasure them <lb/>
up for their own benefit.<lb/>
This indeed was my principal aim, to furnish <lb/>
my young Parishioners with a stock of <lb/>
Divine Instructions; and to teach them by <lb/>
this Essay the way of using the Scriptures: <lb/>
And though for good Reasons, I have chosen <lb/>
my Proofs wholly out of the New Testament, <lb/>
which is the proper ground of all Christian <lb/>
Doctrine; yet after this Pattern, they <lb/>
may improve all the parts of the Bible to <lb/>
Knowledge, and Piety, and <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised>. The <lb/>
Proofs which I have selected from the great <lb/>
plenty before me, are set down in a Catechetical <lb/>
Form, and in words at length; because <lb/>
the bare pointing to them by Marginal References, <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not the due effect upon the generality <lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
of the People, for want of their diligence <lb/>
to consult them: Whereas such Passages <lb/>
inculcated to them in the <normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised> Assemblies, <lb/>
and laid up in their Memories; may <lb/>
prove very instrumental (by the Grace of <lb/>
God) to guide their Steps, and to preserve <lb/>
them against <normalised orig="Errour" auto="true">Error</normalised>, and Sin. The same <lb/>
advantage may be expected from the like <lb/>
Method in Private Families: And I would <lb/>
earnestly beseech Parents, and Masters, not <lb/>
to be wanting in this Charitable Office to <lb/>
those under their care; but to initiate them <lb/>
seasonably in the Principles of Religion, and <lb/>
to prepare them regularly for Confirmation, <lb/>
according to the excellent Order of the <lb/>
Church, and the Example of the Primitive <lb/>
Times: That by such early engagements, <lb/>
they may be fitted for higher degrees of Proficiency; <lb/>
and may walk uprightly in the midst <lb/>
of a crooked Generation, neither declining <lb/>
to the right hand, nor to the left. <normalised orig="Domestick" auto="true">Domestic</normalised> <lb/>
Institution is to lead the way to the <lb/>
Church; and <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> a true Observation, <lb/>
made by one very eminent in Learning, <lb/>
and Piety; Let us preach never so <lb/>
many Sermons unto the People, our labour <lb/>
is but lost, as long as the Foundation <lb/>
is unlaid, and the first Principles untaught, <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
upon which all other Doctrine <lb/>
must be builded: And therefore no Christian, <lb/>
that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> under him any tender, and <lb/>
uninstructed Souls, can be ignorant of his <lb/>
Duty in training them up Religiously; a <lb/>
Duty visible even by the light of Nature; <lb/>
and commanded by God to his ancient People; <lb/>
and recommended by Apostolical Exhortations; <lb/>
and <normalised orig="acknowledg'd" auto="true">acknowledged</normalised> in all Ages to <lb/>
be of Universal Necessity. Let us then be <lb/>
active, and faithful in discharging this Obligation; <lb/>
as knowing that we must give an <lb/>
account to God, for the little ones entrusted <lb/>
with us: But when we have done what lies <lb/>
in our power, we must depend upon the Divine <lb/>
Blessing, for the success of our Endeavours; <lb/>
for <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 3.7">Neither is he <lb/>
<normalised orig="planteth" auto="true">plants</normalised> any thing, neither he <lb/>
that <normalised orig="watereth" auto="true">waters</normalised>; but God that <normalised orig="giveth" auto="true">gives</normalised> the <lb/>
increase.</quote>
