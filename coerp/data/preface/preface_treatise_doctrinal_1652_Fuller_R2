                  <lb/>
To the Reader. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
WHo is not sensible with sorrow of the distractions <lb/>
of this age? To write books therefore <lb/>
may seem unseasonable, especially in a <lb/>
time wherein the <normalised orig="Presse" auto="true">Press</normalised>, like an unruly <lb/>
horse, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> cast off his bridle of being Licensed, <lb/>
and some serious books, which dare <normalised orig="flie" auto="true">fly</normalised> abroad, are <lb/>
hooted at by a flock of Pamphlets. <lb/>
But be pleased to know that when I left my home, it <lb/>
was fair weather, and my journey was half past, before I <lb/>
discovered the tempest, and had gone so <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> in this <lb/>
Work, that I could neither go backward with credit, nor <lb/>
forward with comfort. <lb/>
As for the matter of this Book, therein I am resident on <lb/>
my Profession; <normalised orig="Holinesse" auto="true">Holiness</normalised> in the latitude thereof falling <lb/>
under the <normalised orig="cognizance" auto="true">cognisance</normalised> of a Divine. For curious method, <lb/>
expect none, Essays for the most part not being placed as <lb/>
at a Feast,but placing themselves as at an Ordinary. <lb/>
The characters I have conformed to the then standing <lb/>
Laws of the Realm, (a <normalised orig="twelvemoneth" auto="false">twelvemonth</normalised> ago were they sent <lb/>
to the <normalised orig="Presse" auto="true">Press</normalised>) since which time the <normalised orig="wisdome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised> of the King <lb/>
and State <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> thought fitting to alter many things, and I <lb/>
expect the discretion of the Reader should make his alterations <lb/>
accordingly. And I conjure thee by all Christian <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 3</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
ingenuity, that if lightning here on some passages, rather <lb/>
harsh-sounding then ill-intended, to construe the same by <lb/>
the <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> drift and main scope which is aimed at. <lb/>
Nor let it render the <normalised orig="modestie" auto="true">modesty</normalised> of this Book suspected, <lb/>
because it presumes to appear in company <normalised orig="unmann'd" auto="true">unmanned</normalised> by <lb/>
any Patron: If right, it will defend it self; if wrong, none <lb/>
can defend it: Truth needs not, Falsehood deserves not a <lb/>
Supporter. And indeed the matter of this Work is too <lb/>
high for a subjects, the workmanship thereof too low for a <lb/>
Princes <normalised orig="patranage" auto="false">patronage</normalised>. <lb/>
And now I will turn my pen into prayer, That God <lb/>
would be pleased to discloud these gloomy <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> with the <lb/>
beams of his mercy: which if I may be so happy as to see, <lb/>
it will then encourage me to count it <normalised orig="freedome" auto="true">freedom</normalised> to serve <lb/>
two <normalised orig="apprentiships" auto="false">apprenticeships</normalised> (God spinning out the thick <normalised orig="thred" auto="false">thread</normalised> of <lb/>
my life so long) in writing the <normalised orig="Ecclesiasticall" auto="true">Ecclesiastical</normalised> History <lb/>
from Christs time to our <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, if I shall from remoter <lb/>
parts be so planted, as to enjoy the benefit of walking, and <lb/>
standing Libraries, without which advantages the best <lb/>
<normalised orig="vigilancie" auto="true">vigilance</normalised> <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> but vainly dream to undertake such a task. <lb/>
Mean time I will stop the leakage of my soul, and what <lb/>
heretofore <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> run out in writing, shall hereafter (God <lb/>
willing) be improved in constant preaching, in what <lb/>
place <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised> Gods providence, and friends good will shall <lb/>
fix <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Thine in all Christian offices. <lb/>
