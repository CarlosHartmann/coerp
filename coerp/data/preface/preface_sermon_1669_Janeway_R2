TO <lb/>
My Beloved HEARERS, <lb/>
Especially <lb/>
Those of the Younger sort, <lb/>
Grace and Peace.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Men, Brethren and Fathers, <lb/>
GOD that made your souls, <lb/>
sets a very high value upon <lb/>
them; and Christ that bought <lb/>
them, though they cost his <lb/>
heart-blood, thought them <lb/>
worth his purchase, and that eternal glory <lb/>
or misery that is prepared for souls speaks <lb/>
them not to be inconsiderable. <normalised orig="Vpon" auto="true">Upon</normalised> this <lb/>
account it's impossible that you and I should <lb/>
use too much diligence in the securing these <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
souls; for this cause the Ministers of Christ <lb/>
can easily over-look prisons, banishment and <lb/>
faggots, so that they may but be instrumental <lb/>
for the saving of souls, and delivering them <lb/>
from the wrath to come: This I hope is <lb/>
the ground that I am carrying on in this <lb/>
ensuing Discourse: This may speak when I <lb/>
may not, when I cannot. I might give <lb/>
many reasons of my appearing thus in print. <lb/>
I might tell the world of the desires of many, <lb/>
that by reason of the multitude could <lb/>
only see, but not hear. I might speak of <lb/>
the want of time to deliver the fourth Part <lb/>
of what is here presented to you. I might <lb/>
tell you of the importunity of some of the <lb/>
young men that would gladly write after <lb/>
this <normalised orig="Coppy" auto="true">Copy</normalised>: But I must profess all this would <lb/>
have signified little with me; did I not find <lb/>
by that account which some give of the work <lb/>
of grace upon their hearts, that the Lord <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> owned my poor papers formerly: <lb/>
Among others, that poor penitent <normalised orig="Murtherer" auto="true">Murderer</normalised>, <lb/>
Thomas Savage, which makes me not <lb/>
without hope that the same Spirit which <lb/>
breathed life into my other Writings, may <lb/>
please also to give a blessing to these. I will <lb/>
not stand now to answer the Objections <lb/>
that may be made against the Publication <lb/>
of this Sermon. I never met with this, <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
that it is impossible that it should be subservient <lb/>
to the salvation of a soul, and <lb/>
therefore I think the cost answerable. I <lb/>
must confess, had it not been for a necessary <lb/>
Caution or two, I should have eased you <lb/>
of the trouble of reading, and my self of <lb/>
writing this Epistle. The first is this; Be <lb/>
not offended if you find in the Young <lb/>
Mans Evidences some expressions that may <lb/>
sound somewhat harsh, and some tautologies; <lb/>
remember that they are word for word from <lb/>
his own papers, as he wrote them hastily: <lb/>
consider also that he was but young, and a <lb/>
servant too; so that it seems almost incredible <lb/>
that one that had so much business, <lb/>
should be able to redeem so much time as to <lb/>
do what he did of this nature. Secondly, <lb/>
I would it might be a little considered <lb/>
what a hurry I was in when this task was <lb/>
laid upon me, and how little time to peruse <lb/>
my own <normalised orig="Coppy" auto="true">Copy</normalised>; I beg you therefore candidly <lb/>
to over-look many mistakes. As for <lb/>
you, my dear friends, I suppose a pardon <lb/>
is easily granted. As for others, scorn not <lb/>
holiness, <normalised orig="contemn" auto="true">condemn</normalised> not the future blessedness, <lb/>
and make sure of happiness in the life <lb/>
to come, and then I can easily bear your <lb/>
slighting of me. Young Men, I may be bold <lb/>
with you; I charge you as you value <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 3</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
the comforts of another life, forget not <lb/>
what an excellent example this precious <lb/>
Brother of yours gave you. Read this ensuing <lb/>
Discourse with <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>seriousnesness</sic>
                     <corr>seriousness</corr>
                  </choice>, and let <lb/>
it be read again in your lives. Brethren, <lb/>
you are my Joy and Crown, and if you <lb/>
stand fast, I live. O make not my boasting <lb/>
void! How can I bear to think that <lb/>
any of you should perish? For Gods sake, <lb/>
and for your souls sake, <normalised orig="falsifie" auto="true">falsify</normalised> that Proverb, <lb/>
A Young Saint, and an Old Devil.<lb/>
Brethren, my hearts desire is, that I may <lb/>
see you all with that blessed Saint at the <lb/>
right hand of Christ. Remember, your <lb/>
sands run apace, and you are hasting into <lb/>
Eternity. O make sure of that which will <lb/>
stand you in some stead when you die! O <lb/>
secure somewhat to live comfortably upon <lb/>
in another world! let your lives bespeak <lb/>
you persons resolved for Christ, and Heaven <lb/>
upon any terms. Let your <normalised orig="loyns" auto="true">loins</normalised> be <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> <lb/>
girt, and your lamps be burning. Watch <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised>, <lb/>
be strong; quit you like men. Remember, <lb/>
Christ, Heaven and Glory are before you. <lb/>
Sit not still till you are safe in the bosom <lb/>
of Christ. Consider that many set out fair. <lb/>
and look as if they were bound for Zion, and <lb/>
yet founder in the way. I say again, make <lb/>
sure: Sirs, I expect ere long to pass upon <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
Eternity; let me beg of you as you hope for <lb/>
our good meeting in another world, that <lb/>
you make Religion your business, and labour <lb/>
to get every day nearer Heaven. Endeavour <lb/>
not only to be Christians, but solid, <lb/>
experienced, and exemplary Christians; <lb/>
that so you may prove the glory of your <lb/>
generation, the credit of Religion, and the <lb/>
Joy of gray-headed Saints. Sirs, you are <lb/>
now my hope; your love, zeal and union, <lb/>
my comfort; go but on at this rate, and you <lb/>
are made for ever. Know this, now the <lb/>
eyes of the world will be upon you; nay, <lb/>
that which is more, the eye of God is upon <lb/>
you, and will take notice how you improve <lb/>
such a Providence as this. I beseech you look <lb/>
about, and let the world understand that <lb/>
you are not nominal Christians, but real <lb/>
Saints. Will any of you send me sorrowing <lb/>
into the grave? shall I lose my hopes, <lb/>
and comforts, and you your souls? can you <lb/>
easily forget what was the practice of this <lb/>
Young Man? do you remember what was the <lb/>
usual subject of his discourse? did you not <lb/>
observe how holily, meekly and diligently he <lb/>
served his great Master? is there no weight <lb/>
in a Crown of Glory? is there no desireableness <lb/>
in happiness? is it a small thing to <lb/>
live in the society of God, Saints and <lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
Angels? I am <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> you think these <lb/>
things considerable. Well then, act as persons <lb/>
that long for possession; which that all <lb/>
of you may enjoy, is, and shall be the prayer <lb/>
of one that desires not to count his life dear <lb/>
so he may but finish his course with joy, and <lb/>
meet you with comfort hereafter; <lb/>
                  <lb/>
