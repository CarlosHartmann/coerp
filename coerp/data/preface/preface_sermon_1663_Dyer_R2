               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
To all my Loving Friends, into<lb/>
whose hands these shall come,<lb/>
Greeting.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
My dearest Friends,<lb/>
WHom I Love dearly, Remember <lb/>
daily, Long for <lb/>
greatly, Pray for earnestly, <lb/>
and Praise God heartily, <lb/>
to whom I could <lb/>
write with my purest <lb/>
Blood, and do send these Lines from <lb/>
my very inward Bowels. <lb/>
Though I cannot say I am so transported <lb/>
with affection and zeal, as Paul, <lb/>
to wish my self accursed from Christ for <lb/>
their sakes: Yet, I am <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised>, I <lb/>
could be contented, with Jonas, to be <lb/>
cast into the Sea, for the pacifying of <lb/>
God's Wrath for you. That I may be <lb/>
free from the blood of all men, I am <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
resolved, in the strength, and by the <lb/>
power of God, to deal plainly, and I <lb/>
hope sincerely with all men, not valuing <lb/>
the smiles, nor fearing the frowns <lb/>
of wicked men: It is better to lose the <lb/>
smiles of men, than it is to lose the souls <lb/>
of men: Though there be many that <lb/>
are enemies to me, yet I am an enemy <lb/>
to none; a hater of no man's person, <lb/>
but a lover of every man's soul: He that <lb/>
loved me when I was an enemy, <normalised orig="commandeth" auto="true">commands</normalised> <lb/>
me to love mine enemies. <lb/>
Dear Christians, cleave to the Lord, <lb/>
and follow after the Lord fully: Neglect <lb/>
no duty, though you know there is <lb/>
great danger in doing it: Fear God <lb/>
and sin, more than men and suffering: <lb/>
Let your souls bear up with Christ, bear <lb/>
off from the World, bear down your <lb/>
Corruptions, and bear forth your Testimony: <lb/>
Respect all, reject none of <lb/>
God's Commandments; take patiently <lb/>
and thankfully the hardest dealings of <lb/>
God. <lb/>
The heaviest Afflictions on Earth are <lb/>
but light, in comparison of Christ's sufferings, <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
or the punishment of the wicked <lb/>
in Hell: When God's People are <lb/>
humble enough, and the Wicked high <lb/>
enough, and the Lord's appointed time <lb/>
come, then expect deliverance to the <lb/>
Godly, and not before. You should <lb/>
not envy the patience of God towards <lb/>
your enemies, for it is nothing in comparison <lb/>
of what love he <normalised orig="sheweth" auto="true">shows</normalised> to you: <lb/>
Be you diligent at your work, and leave <lb/>
God at his work; you need not fear <lb/>
success: The Lord will soon turn <lb/>
from his wrath, if men were turned <lb/>
from their <normalised orig="wickednesses" auto="true">wickedness</normalised>: Look narrowly <lb/>
to your hearts, tongues and ways: <lb/>
I never trusted God but I found him <lb/>
faithful, nor my own heart but I found <lb/>
it false. Take heed, Friends, that you <lb/>
be not <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> wooing Christ, and yet <lb/>
never married to him: Therefore never <lb/>
leave till you have put the great <lb/>
Question out of question. <lb/>
Look upon Christ, first without you, <lb/>
and then search for Christ within you; <lb/>
he that will clearly see with the eye of <lb/>
Faith, must shut the eye of Reason. It <lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
is the will of God, that Saints should <normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised> <lb/>
more in what Christ <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> done <lb/>
for them, than in what they have done <lb/>
for Christ. <lb/>
Oh lay up, and lay out for Christ; <lb/>
make haste and do your work, and <lb/>
God will make haste and give you your <lb/>
wages. <lb/>
Dear sirs, I beseech you with beseeching, <lb/>
consider will of these things; <lb/>
for these are precious Truths, weighty <lb/>
Truths, and necessary Truths. <lb/>
I shall add no more, but promise you <lb/>
my Prayers, and request your Prayers <lb/>
for me, and for a blessing upon this, that <lb/>
it may bring glory to God, and good to <lb/>
you; which is all that is aimed at by <lb/>
him who is <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Your Souls Servant, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
William Dyer.<lb/>
