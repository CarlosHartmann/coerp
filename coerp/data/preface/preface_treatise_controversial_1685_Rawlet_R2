               <head>THE <lb/>
PREFACE.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
I Do not think there needs any excuse to be <lb/>
made for answering a Book written against <lb/>
our Religion: If there were, I could truly <lb/>
produce that common one of being put upon <lb/>
it by Friends. For it's now more than <lb/>
a year since some very worthy Friends (to whom <lb/>
my Obligations are too great to dispute their Commands) <lb/>
did put into my hands a little Popish <lb/>
Book, called, A Short Catechism against all <lb/>
<notvariant>Sectaries</notvariant>, said to be Translated by C. M. desiring <lb/>
me to write a plain Answer thereto by way of Dialogue, <lb/>
such as might be fitted for the capacities <lb/>
of common people. In obedience to whom I presently <lb/>
betook my self to the work, wherein I have <lb/>
proceeded very slowly, being daily interrupted with <lb/>
other employments. But now at length having <lb/>
<normalised orig="finish'd" auto="true">finished</normalised> it, I present it to the World, heartily <lb/>
wishing it may have a success answerable to the <lb/>
truth and goodness of the cause I maintain, and <lb/>
to the design both of my self in Writing and Publishing <lb/>
it, and of my Friends in putting me upon <lb/>
it. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 3</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
I am not so vain as to pretend to have said <lb/>
any thing new on a Subject so very common, and <lb/>
which for a long time <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> exercised the Pens of <lb/>
very many persons of greatest Wit and Learning, <lb/>
both in our own and other Nations. Let it suffice, <lb/>
what I hope without any vanity may be said, that <lb/>
I think I have here delivered certain and solid <lb/>
Truth in plain and <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> Words, that even he that <lb/>
runs may read and understand the same. I can <lb/>
also truly add, that in answering this my Popish <lb/>
Author, I have used all manner of honest and <lb/>
fair dealing, as becomes a sincere Lover of Truth. <lb/>
I have not indeed always followed him word for <lb/>
word, especially not in his second and third Chapters, <lb/>
in the former of which he endeavours to <lb/>
prove, That Protestants have not the marks of a <lb/>
true Church; in the latter, That the Church of <lb/>
Rome <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> them. These two I have handled together, <lb/>
and though I have left out much of his <lb/>
reviling Language, which I thought needed no answer, <lb/>
nor deserved any notice; yet I do not know <lb/>
that I have past over any one Argument either <lb/>
there or in any other place. Some perhaps may <lb/>
look on it as a fault that I have often followed him <lb/>
too punctually, which has occasioned the frequent <lb/>
repetition of the same things, but this may be useful <lb/>
to some Readers. If I have not every where <lb/>
quoted his very words (as for the most part I have <lb/>
done) yet I am sure I have never willingly misrepresented <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
his sense, nor proposed his Arguments <lb/>
with disadvantage, but rather have added what I <lb/>
thought might give strength thereto. And as I <lb/>
know not that I have any where overlooked one <lb/>
Argument without answering it, so neither have I <lb/>
returned any answer, but what in my Conscience <lb/>
I thought to be just and true, and with which my <lb/>
own mind is well satisfied. I have not so confined <lb/>
my self to this Author, but that I have <lb/>
also taken notice of some other points which he <lb/>
never mentions. And though I may be far enough <lb/>
from having spoken to all that are in controversy <lb/>
betwixt us and the Church of Rome, yet I <lb/>
think I have not wholly omitted those which <lb/>
are of greatest weight. At least, I am well assured <lb/>
that I have said enough to satisfy any considering <lb/>
impartial person, that there is not the <lb/>
least reason, why any Man should depart from the <lb/>
Communion of the Church of England, and betake <lb/>
himself to that of Rome: Since the <normalised orig="Romish" auto="true">Roman</normalised> <lb/>
Church has no manner of Authority over us, <lb/>
and is moreover guilty of retaining and imposing <lb/>
such gross and dangerous Errors and Corruptions, <lb/>
as render her Communion utterly unlawful and <lb/>
unsafe, even to those who have been born and bred <lb/>
in her bosom. How unreasonable then is it for us <lb/>
to revolt to her? And indeed my chief design in <lb/>
this undertaking is to confirm those of our own <lb/>
Church in strict Communion with it, having little <lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
hope of bringing over many Proselytes from the <lb/>
Church of Rome. Where I can expect but few <lb/>
Readers, I must not look for many Converts. <lb/>
Those Guides who are not willing to trust their <lb/>
People with the Holy Scriptures, which yet they <lb/>
say are on their side, will be less willing they should <lb/>
read the Books of those whom they account their <lb/>
Enemies; and too oft they account us so, as the Jews <lb/>
did our Saviour, <normalised orig="meerly" auto="true">merely</normalised> for telling them the truth. <lb/>
But if any of that Persuasion should be so ingenuous <lb/>
as to give this little Book a fair Reading, <lb/>
and shall bring along with him a mind as free <lb/>
from passion and prejudice as the Author had in <lb/>
Writing it, I dare say that it will either <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> <lb/>
him to become a Member of our most excellent <lb/>
Church, or at least convince him, that we <lb/>
who are already so, have great reason not to depart <lb/>
from it: Since this our departure, beside all other <lb/>
faults involved in it, would render us guilty of <lb/>
an apparent Schism. And this guilt I reckon is <lb/>
most justly chargeable on the Papists amongst us: <lb/>
And not on them only, but also on those Protestant <lb/>
Dissenters (as they are commonly called) <lb/>
of what Denomination <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised>, who separate from <lb/>
us into distinct Societies, which they set up in opposition <lb/>
to our Church as by Law established. For <lb/>
if in this Church all things needful to Salvation <lb/>
are afforded, and no sinful condition imposed, <lb/>
then do they make a causeless, sinful separation, <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
who withdraw from its Communion. Neither <lb/>
can these our Dissenters justly plead the same Arguments <lb/>
for their Separation from us, that our <lb/>
Church can for its withdrawing from the Church <lb/>
of Rome, or rather for Reforming her self from <lb/>
the corruptions of that Church, as I have briefly <lb/>
<normalised orig="shewn" auto="true">shown</normalised> toward the end of this Treatise. They who <lb/>
would see this more fully demonstrated, let them <lb/>
read a Discourse which purposely handles this Subject, <lb/>
being one of the Cases lately Written, as is <lb/>
said, by some of the London Ministers. And <lb/>
indeed I scarce know any Books that I would sooner <lb/>
recommend to the Common Reader, for his <lb/>
direction in these matters, than all those Discourses, <lb/>
which treat of the several points in difference <lb/>
betwixt our Church, and the Non-conformists, <lb/>
and also of some of those betwixt us and <lb/>
the Papists: And are generally Written with <lb/>
such clearness of judgment, and with such calmness <lb/>
and good temper, as may render them more <lb/>
acceptable and more useful, through God's Blessing, <lb/>
to those for whose sake they were Written. <lb/>
But whilst we are thus engaged in disputes and <lb/>
controversies, let us look well to the temper of our <lb/>
minds, and take great care that we lose not peace <lb/>
or charity, whilst we are inquiring after and contending <lb/>
for the truth. Let us have as great an <lb/>
aversion as we will from the errors, the ill <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>prin*iples</sic>
                     <corr>principles</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
and practices of any sort of men; but let us <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">b</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
not have the least enmity to their persons upon any <lb/>
pretence whatever. Let us pity them, and pray for <lb/>
them, and do all we can in our several places to <lb/>
instruct them, to reduce and reform them: but let <lb/>
us not hate or envy them, not rail upon or revile <lb/>
them, not wish them or do them any hurt, nor <normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised> <lb/>
in any mischief that befalls them, nor vex our <lb/>
selves at their prosperity, or with the fears and <lb/>
forethoughts of it. Let us not fret our selves in <lb/>
any wise to do evil. <lb/>
For that end above all let us take heed of such a <lb/>
fierce and furious zeal as tends to disturb the peace <lb/>
of Church and State. That's no true zeal for Religion <lb/>
which produces such ill effects, but rather a <lb/>
zeal for opinions and parties, or for outward advantages, <lb/>
and proceeds from pride, envy, revenge, <lb/>
distrust of God, and such like evil principles. <quote type="biblical" ana="Jas 3.17">But <lb/>
the wisdom which is from above is pure and <lb/>
peaceable</quote>. True Religion inspires the breasts of <lb/>
men with meekness and patience, humility and charity, <lb/>
renders them calm and quiet, gentle and tractable, <lb/>
<normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> to be <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised>, and <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> to be governed. <lb/>
Next to piety to God, what greater duty <lb/>
of Religion than Loyalty to our Prince as the Minister <lb/>
of God? How then can Religion be <normalised orig="exprest" auto="true">expressed</normalised> <lb/>
or promoted by Sedition and Rebellion, any more <lb/>
than by cursing and swearing, and such like profaneness? <lb/>
He that talks of rebelling for his Religion, <lb/>
has lost what he contends for before he begins <lb/>
the contest. For what Religion has he who resists <lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
the Ordinance of God? And this (as we are taught <lb/>
by God himself) he does who resists that lawful authority <lb/>
which God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> set over him. But we must <lb/>
<normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> that we Fear God by Honouring the King, <lb/>
and loving all men, especially our Christian Brethren. <lb/>
This is the language of Holy Scripture, <lb/>
and this is the Doctrine of our Church. <lb/>
Let us then live in peaceable Communion with <lb/>
this Church, and let us in all respects behave our <lb/>
selves in so loyal and dutiful a manner toward our <lb/>
King, as she instructs and obliges us to do; even <lb/>
so that we may deserve the Character which one of <lb/>
the Ancients in his Apology for the Christians, <lb/>
gives of them, viz. That a Christian is an enemy <lb/>
to no man, much less to his Prince. Thus <lb/>
ought we to practise if we will be true to our profession. <lb/>
For the Religion of our Church (as I have <lb/>
often said and fully proved in the following Discourse) <lb/>
is no other than the Christian Religion, <lb/>
the very same which our Blessed Saviour and his <lb/>
Apostles taught, without either Popish or <normalised orig="Phanatical" auto="true">Fanatical</normalised> <lb/>
corruptions and additions. <lb/>
And as in other points, so particularly in this <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>o*</sic>
                     <corr>of</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
obedience to Magistrates, she inculcates what Christ <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> commanded, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 22.21;Lk 20.25;Mk 12.17">Give unto Caesar the things <lb/>
that are Caesars</quote>; and that of St. Paul, <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 13.1">Let every <lb/>
soul be subject to the higher Powers</quote>, &amp;c. <lb/>
even Bishops and Priests as well as Lay-men; and <lb/>
this <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 13.5">not only for wrath but conscience sake</quote>. Or <lb/>
as St. Peter, <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Pet 2.13">Submit to every ordinance of man <lb/>
                     <lb/>
                     <fw type="pageNum">b 2</fw>
                     <pb n="7"/>
                     <lb/>
for the Lords-sake</quote>. This was the Doctrine and <lb/>
practice of the Apostles, and of the Primitive <lb/>
Christians in the first and purest ages, when they <lb/>
had the greatest temptations to the contrary even <lb/>
in times of hottest persecution; and this not for <lb/>
want of strength (as <notvariant>Bellarmine</notvariant> to their great dishonour, <lb/>
would have it thought, Lib. 5. de <normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>. <lb/>
Pont. Cap. 7.) but out of obedience to Gods commands <lb/>
and faith in his promises. But in succeeding <lb/>
ages of greater prosperity, as the Church declined <lb/>
from her purity in many other respects, so <lb/>
also in point of subjection and obedience to <normalised orig="Governours" auto="true">Governors</normalised>. <lb/>
Then began Prelates to contend with Princes, <lb/>
and the Pope to set himself against, yea above <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Emperour" auto="true">Emperor</normalised>. Then <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*y</sic>
                     <corr>by</corr>
                  </choice> degrees he <normalised orig="claim'd" auto="true">claimed</normalised> a <lb/>
power of deposing even Kings for what he shall <lb/>
<normalised orig="judg" auto="true">judge</normalised> <normalised orig="heresie" auto="true">heresy</normalised>, and of absolving Subjects from their <lb/>
Allegiance, (which by the way, <notvariant>Bellarmine</notvariant> very <lb/>
finely compares to that power which the spirit <lb/>
ought to have over the flesh. (Lib. 5. de <normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>. <lb/>
Pontif. Cap. 6.) Then were the Clergy exempted <lb/>
from the jurisdiction of the Civil Magistrate, with <lb/>
many other encroachments upon the rights of <lb/>
Princes, which they of the Church of Rome were <lb/>
especially guilty of. But it was the design of our pious <lb/>
Reformers to remove these as well as other abuses, <lb/>
and to restore Religion to its Primitive purity <lb/>
as far as possible. And this they have done, as <lb/>
in many other instances, so particularly in asserting <lb/>
the just power and prerogative of Kings; strictly <lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
obliging all the members of this Church, whether <lb/>
Clergy or Laity, to yield all that homage and honour, <lb/>
that obedience and subjection, which by the <lb/>
plain dictates of reason and nature, and by the express <lb/>
Laws of God in Holy Scripture, are most <lb/>
justly due to them. And as it was the glory of the <lb/>
Primitive Church, so has it been of ours, ever <lb/>
since the happy time of her Reformation, that she <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> always maintained her Loyalty and Allegiance <lb/>
untainted and unshaken. And <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> fixed it <lb/>
on such principles as will make it firm and steady <lb/>
in all times, and under all Princes, on such as <lb/>
made the Primitive Christians obedient to their <lb/>
<normalised orig="Emperours" auto="true">Emperors</normalised>, whether Heathen or Christian, Arrian <lb/>
or Orthodox; even on the principles of Religion <lb/>
and Obedience to Almighty God, who <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> set up <lb/>
Kings as his Vicegerents, and <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="expresly" auto="true">expressly</normalised> commanded <lb/>
us to reverence and obey them as such, <lb/>
<normalised orig="threatning" auto="true">threatening</normalised> damnation to them that resist; and <lb/>
promising an eternal Kingdom of Glory to the meek <lb/>
and peaceable, and to the patient sufferer for <lb/>
righteousness sake. This, I say, is Primitive <lb/>
Christianity, and this is the true Protestant <lb/>
Doctrine of our Church, taught by our first Reformers, <lb/>
and by their genuine successors ever since. <lb/>
So that it seems not without reason that several <lb/>
learned men make this a chief distinguishing character <lb/>
of a True Protestant (without an Irony) <lb/>
that he owns the Kings Supremacy, as our Church <lb/>
has defined it. I am sure he that denies it, so far <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">b 3</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
agrees with the Papists. Wherefore if we would <lb/>
restore due honour to the name of Protestant, which <lb/>
by the abuse of pretenders, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> of late been exposed <lb/>
to derision and contempt, let us live according <lb/>
to the Doctrine of our Church; whilst we <lb/>
profess our selves zealous for Protestant Religion, <lb/>
and cry out bitterly against Popery, let us <lb/>
take heed of embracing some of the vilest principles <lb/>
and practices of it, such as were broached <lb/>
and <normalised orig="maintain'd" auto="true">maintained</normalised> chiefly by their furious Hildebrands, <lb/>
and some of the worst men amongst <lb/>
them, I mean their Doctrine of resisting and rebelling <lb/>
against lawful <normalised orig="Soveraigns" auto="true">Sovereigns</normalised> upon pretence of <lb/>
Religion and the honour of God, for the defence <lb/>
of his Church, and the carrying on his cause. The <lb/>
Holy God needs not the wickedness of men to defend <lb/>
any <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>ca*<normalised orig="se" auto="true">see</normalised></sic>
                     <corr>cause</corr>
                  </choice> of his; nor is Religion like to be <lb/>
secured by irreligious means; nor Gods honour <lb/>
promoted by a contempt of his authority in disobeying <lb/>
his commands. True Religion will make us <lb/>
impartial and uniform in the performance of <lb/>
our duty, and teach us to have a respect to all <lb/>
Gods Commandments, to the fifth as well as to <lb/>
the first or second; so that we shall no more <lb/>
dare to <normalised orig="rebell" auto="true">rebel</normalised> against our lawful <normalised orig="Soveraign" auto="true">Sovereign</normalised>, and <lb/>
set up an <normalised orig="Vsurper" auto="true">Usurper</normalised>, than to disown the true God, <lb/>
and worship an Idol. <lb/>
But I have been longer on this Subject than I <lb/>
intended, and therefore shall hasten to conclude this <lb/>
Preface as I have done my Book, with a most serious <lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
and earnest exhortation to the Reader, that <lb/>
above all things he be careful to lead an universally <lb/>
religious and good life, giving in the first <lb/>
place to God the things that are Gods, and then <lb/>
to Caesar the things that are his. Let God be all in <lb/>
all to our souls, and let his authority wholly govern <lb/>
and sway us in the whole course of our lives. Let <lb/>
us study to know his will as he has plainly revealed <lb/>
it in his holy Word, and let us most strictly and <lb/>
faithfully comply with it in all things. Never let <lb/>
the hopes of any wordly advantage, or the fear of <lb/>
any loss or suffering draw us into the wilful commission <lb/>
of any sin, or into the wilful neglect of our <lb/>
duty. Neither the commands of the greatest Monarch, <lb/>
nor the example of the multitude will be <lb/>
any excuse for going against the light of Gods <lb/>
Word, and our own Consciences. There is not <lb/>
the least doubt of it but that God must be obeyed <lb/>
rather than man, when their commands do <lb/>
indeed thwart and contradict each other. Gods <lb/>
favour is more to be desired than all the riches <lb/>
and honours of the world, and his wrath more <lb/>
to be feared than all the miseries and sufferings <lb/>
of this life. <quote type="biblical" ana="Mk 8.36">What will it profit a man to gain <lb/>
the whole world and lose his own soul?</quote> But <lb/>
as no pretence of Loyalty and Obedience to Kings <lb/>
will at any time <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> our breach of Gods commands, <lb/>
who is the King of Kings, so neither will <lb/>
the pretence of Religion any more warrant our <lb/>
resistance of lawful authority. If we cannot obey <lb/>

                  <lb/>
with a good conscience, then we ought to suffer <lb/>
with quietness and patience. This is every where <lb/>
the Lesson which the Gospel teaches, and which is <lb/>
more especially recommended to us by the example <lb/>
of our Blessed Lord and Master; and if ever we <lb/>
hope to live and reign with him hereafter, we must <lb/>
now deny our selves and take up our cross and <lb/>
follow him; even in meekness and patience must <lb/>
we follow him as well as in righteousness and mercy, <lb/>
purity and temperance, or any other graces. <lb/>
Yea by this means we shall best consult for the present <lb/>
safety and honour both of our selves and our <lb/>
Religion. Who will (or what can) harm us if <lb/>
we be <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Pet 3.13">followers of that which is good</quote>? This <lb/>
will incline Kings to be Nursing Fathers to the <lb/>
Church, when the Church trains up her Children <lb/>
in obedience to God and the King. Above all, <lb/>
this will procure the blessing and favour of Almighty <lb/>
God, wherein consists all our safety and felicity. <lb/>
We may hope still to enjoy his Presence and <lb/>
his Gospel, whilst we bring forth such good fruits <lb/>
of it, and <quote type="biblical" ana="Col 1.10">walk worthy of the Lord in all well-pleasing</quote>. <lb/>
He will continue our peace and prosperity <lb/>
so far as he sees good for us, and will suffer nothing <lb/>
to befall us but what shall make for the interest <lb/>
of Religion and our own truest advantage. <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 3.10">Say to the righteous it shall be well with him</quote>, <lb/>
whether in peace and prosperity, or in sufferings <lb/>
and adversity. But let us remember St. Peter's <lb/>
advice (1 Pet. 4. 15.) to beware of suffering as <lb/>

for righteousness sake</quote> may <normalised orig="glorifie" auto="true">glorify</normalised> God on <lb/>
that behalf. They alone with confidence may <lb/>
commit themselves to him, who are exercised <lb/>
in well-doing. <lb/>
To him therefore, the only wise, the great and <lb/>
good God, let us freely and <normalised orig="chearfully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised> commit both <lb/>
our souls and bodies and all our concerns, whether <lb/>
<normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> or private: banishing from our minds <lb/>
those faintings and despondencies, those fears and <lb/>
jealousies, which first disturb the peace of our own <lb/>
breasts, and then too often that of the <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised>. Let <lb/>
us but see to do our own duty with faithfulness and <lb/>
diligence, and then let us possess our souls in patience, <lb/>
being assured that <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 25.10">all the ways of God <lb/>
are mercy and truth</quote>; and all his <normalised orig="Providences" auto="true">Providence</normalised> <lb/>
how strange <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised> they may seem to us, shall in <lb/>
the issue sweetly conspire to <normalised orig="fulfill" auto="true">fulfil</normalised> his promises, and <lb/>
accomplish his designs of love to all that truly fear <lb/>
and serve him. Let us look well to the Government <lb/>
of our own spirits and passions, of our tongues <lb/>
and our lives, and then let us leave the Government <lb/>
of the world to the God that made it, who <lb/>
is the absolute Lord and Ruler over all, in whose <lb/>
hands are all the hearts and the affairs of men, and <lb/>
who can turn and order all as he will, and he will <lb/>
do what he sees best and most conducing to the glory <lb/>
of his own name, and the good of his Church, <lb/>
which is a thousand times dearer to him than it <lb/>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
can be to us. Wherefore let us sincerely make Gods <lb/>
Glory our End, and his Word our Rule, and continue <lb/>
<normalised orig="stedfast" auto="true">steadfast</normalised> in communion with our Church <lb/>
which teaches us so to do, and then we can never <lb/>
be utterly defeated, nor need we ever be much dejected. <lb/>
Truth and goodness are most strong and <lb/>
invincible things, and will certainly at last prevail <lb/>
and triumph over error and wickedness. And all <lb/>
that do with courage and honesty engage in their <lb/>
service shall never receive <choice ana="typeset-error">
