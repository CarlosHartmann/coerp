TO MY <lb/>
CHILDREN.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
My dear Children, <lb/>
THO this Plain Discourse of The <lb/>
Necessity of SERIOUS CONSIDERATION <lb/>
and SPEEDY <lb/>
REPENTANCE, seem to me very <lb/>
needful to many, and is therefore published, that <lb/>
all who need it, and please to make use of it, may <lb/>
have by them a friendly Rememebrancer to <lb/>
put them in mind to take all due care of themselves: <lb/>
Yet because of the special Love and <lb/>
Care I ought to have for you, as I am your Father, <lb/>
I do in a more special manner commend it <lb/>
to you, as the very best Advice I am able to give <lb/>
you; and seeing my life cannot now be much longer, <lb/>
it may be the last. <lb/>
If I have expected from you the Duty of Obedient <lb/>
Children, it <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been always more for <lb/>
your sakes than mine own; that you might be <lb/>
sharers in that special Promise which St.Paul <lb/>
tells you belongs to them that Honour their Father <lb/>
and Mother, Ephes. 6. 2, 3. And I shall <lb/>
always reckon, that you very fully pay all that <lb/>
Honour which you owe to me, so long as I see <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 3</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
you make it your chief business to fear God, and <lb/>
keep his Commandments, which is your <lb/>
whole Duty, Eccl. 2. 13. Honour always your <lb/>
Father which is in Heaven; and be sure you can <lb/>
do no greater Honour than that to your Parents <lb/>
upon Earth. And as you may justly expect from <lb/>
me the Love and Care of a Father; so you <lb/>
ought to think, that I never better express either <lb/>
of them towards you, than when, as the same <lb/>
St. Paul <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> commanded me, I endeavour to <lb/>
bring you up <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 6.4">in the nurture and admonition <lb/>
of the Lord</quote>, v. 4. For whatever else God shall <lb/>
enable me to do for you, in this I take care at <lb/>
once both of your Souls and Bodies; Godliness <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Tim 4.8">having the promise of the life that now is, and <lb/>
of that which is to come</quote>, Tim. 4.8. <lb/>
I dare not be confident, that I have not much <lb/>
<normalised orig="fail'd" auto="true">failed</normalised> you in this Duty of a Father, whilst you <lb/>
were all at home with me, and under my eye. Neither <lb/>
can I now hope to have you again much with <lb/>
me whilst I live, or indeed that I shall live much <lb/>
longer to take any care at all of you. The only <lb/>
way therefore that is <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>n*w</sic>
                     <corr>now</corr>
                  </choice> left me, either to make <lb/>
you <choice ana="illegible">

                     <corr>amends</corr>
                  </choice> for such neglects of you, as I may <lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>h*ve</sic>
                     <corr>have</corr>
                  </choice> been at any time guilty of; or to testify <lb/>
my earnest desire, that you may be always happy <lb/>
in the Service, and under the Blessing of Almighty <lb/>
God, the FATHER, SON, and <lb/>
HOLY GHOST, to whom you were in your <lb/>
Baptism dedicated; is first, daily so long as I <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
live to pray for his Grace to guide and govern <lb/>
you in the ways of Truth and Holiness to Eternal <lb/>
Life; and then to put into your hand the <lb/>
substance of all those pious Instructions which <lb/>
I could ever be able to give you, were we to live <lb/>
here together to the World's end. <lb/>
This, if I mistake not, I have already in some <lb/>
good measure done in three small Books, viz. <lb/>
CHRISTIANITY in SHORT; the <lb/>
SCRIPTURE-CATECHISM, and the <lb/>
COMMUNICANT'S GUIDE. If you be <lb/>
perfect in these, you will understand reasonably <lb/>
well both what you are to believe, do, desire, and <lb/>
hope for; and will be able to reap more benefit by <lb/>
the reading of other more excellent Books, and <lb/>
chiefly that Book of books, the BOOK of <lb/>
GOD, which I do charge you with all the Authority <lb/>
of a Father, to read so long as you live, <lb/>
when not unavoidably <normalised orig="hinder'd" auto="true">hindered</normalised> (some part of <lb/>
it daily); and that with the greatest seriousness <lb/>
and attention of mind, with the devoutest Reverence <lb/>
to the Great GOD, whose Word it <lb/>
is, and with most earnest Prayers to Him, to enlighten <lb/>
your understandings by it, and to conform <lb/>
your Wills wholly unto it. <lb/>
Consider well all that you read or hear, and <lb/>
speedily put in practice all that is your Duty to <lb/>
do, and cast off every Sin without delay; As <lb/>
this Discourse will, I hope, convince you, it is <lb/>
altogether necessary for you to do. <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>H*ving</sic>
                     <corr>Having</corr>
                  </choice> therein <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 4</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
said so much to you and others <normalised orig="joyntly" auto="true">jointly</normalised>, I <lb/>
shall not need to say much more now to you <lb/>
alone. Only let me advise you to bear this always <lb/>
in remembrance, That if you will be saved, <lb/>
it must be by obeying the Gospel of JESUS <lb/>
CHRIST, our only Saviour, which you cannot <lb/>
do, but by denying your selves, by doing his <lb/>
will and not your own; following his Rules, <lb/>
and not the Customs and Fashions of the Persons, <lb/>
great or small, amongst whom you live. <lb/>
Our Wills are corrupt and perverse, and the <lb/>
Multitude is always in the broad way to Destruction. <lb/>
You have need of much Christian <lb/>
courage to save your selves from this untoward <lb/>
Generation. O, as you love God and your selves, <lb/>
be neither ashamed nor afraid to live as the <lb/>
few do, which are in the narrow way to Life. <lb/>
Stoutly resolve to be as indifferent for the <lb/>
World, as you see many zealous for it; and as <lb/>
zealous for God and Heaven, as you see others <lb/>
regardless of them. Pray fervently for strength <lb/>
to do as you resolve; and then I doubt not, <lb/>
but you will be a comfort to me whilst I live, <lb/>
and an Honour to me when I am dead; and <lb/>
when you are dead too, we shall all live together <lb/>
again in the Eternal Joys of Heaven, through <lb/>
JESUS CHRIST our Lord. Amen. <lb/>
