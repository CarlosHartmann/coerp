                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
To the Inhabitants within the Diocese <lb/>
of Bath and Wells, THOMAS <lb/>
their Unworthy Bishop, <normalised orig="wisheth" auto="true">wishes</normalised> <lb/>
the Knowledge, and the Love of <lb/>
God. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Dearly Beloved in our Lord,  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
THE Church has provided this short <lb/>
Catechism, or Instruction to be <lb/>
<normalised orig="learn'd" auto="true">learned</normalised> of every person, before <lb/>
he be brought to be <normalised orig="Confirm'd" auto="true">Confirmed</normalised> <lb/>
by the Bishop, wherein she teaches all <lb/>
things that a Christian ought to know, and <lb/>
believe for his Soul's health; and she has <lb/>
<normalised orig="enjoyn'd" auto="true">enjoined</normalised> All Fathers and Mothers, Masters <lb/>
and Dames, to cause their Children, <lb/>
and Servants, and Prentices, to <lb/>
come to the Church at the time appointed, <lb/>
and obediently to hear, and be ordered <lb/>
by the Curate, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> such time as <lb/>
they have <normalised orig="learn'd" auto="true">learned</normalised> all that is here appointed <lb/>
to be <normalised orig="learn'd" auto="true">learned</normalised>. <lb/>
How seasonable and necessary this Injunction <lb/>
is, in these days, our <normalised orig="wofull" auto="true">woeful</normalised> experience <lb/>
does sufficiently convince us, when we <lb/>
reflect on the gross Ingnorance and Irreligion <lb/>
of persons in those places, where <normalised orig="Catechizing" auto="true">Catechising</normalised> <lb/>
is <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>negl*cted</sic>
                     <corr>neglected</corr>
                  </choice>, which all sober Christians do <lb/>
sadly deplore. <lb/>
Since then the Providence of God, who <lb/>
is wont to <normalised orig="glorifie" auto="true">glorify</normalised> his strength in the weakness <lb/>
of the Instruments he uses, has caught <lb/>
me up from among the meanest <normalised orig="Herdmen" auto="true">Herdsmen</normalised>, <lb/>
into the Pastoral Throne, and has been <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
pleased to commit you to my care; The Love <lb/>
I ought to pay to the chief Shepherd, obliges <lb/>
me to feed all his Lambs and his Sheep <lb/>
that belong to my flock, and according to my <lb/>
poor abilities, to teach them the Knowledge, <lb/>
and the Love of God, and how they may <lb/>
make them both their daily study and practice. <lb/>
One thing <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> I most earnestly beg of <lb/>
you all, whether old or young, that <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> would <lb/>
help me to save your own Souls; that <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> <lb/>
would learn, and seriously consider, again <lb/>
and again, the terms on which your Salvation <lb/>
is to be had. <lb/>
As for you who have Families, I beseech <lb/>
you to instill into your Children and Servants <lb/>
their Duty, both by your Teaching, and your <lb/>
Example: In good earnest, it is less cruel <lb/>
and unnatural to deny them Bread for their <lb/>
mortal Bodies, than saving Knowledge for <lb/>
their immortal Souls. <lb/>
<normalised orig="Ye" auto="true">You</normalised> that are Fathers, or Masters, I exhort <lb/>
you to tread in the steps of Abraham, <lb/>
the Father of the <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised>, and the friend <lb/>
of God, and like him, to command <lb/>
your Children and <normalised orig="Housholds" auto="true">Households</normalised> to keep <lb/>
the way of the Lord. <lb/>
<normalised orig="Ye" auto="true">You</normalised> that are Mothers, or Mistresses, I exhort <lb/>
you to imitate that unfeigned Faith, <lb/>
which dwelt in young Timothy's Grand-mother <lb/>
Lois, and his Mother Eunice, <lb/>
who taught him from a Child to know <lb/>
the Holy Scriptures, which were able to <lb/>
make him wise to Salvation; and like <lb/>
them, to bring up your Children and Servants <lb/>
in the nurture and admonition of <lb/>
the Lord. <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
I passionately exhort and beseech you all, <lb/>
of either Sex, never to cease your conscientious <lb/>
zeal for their instruction, till you bring <lb/>
them to Confirmation; To renew their Baptismal <lb/>
vow; To make open profession of their <lb/>
Christianity; To discharge their Godfathers <lb/>
and Godmothers; To receive the solemn <lb/>
Benediction of the Bishop; To share <lb/>
in the <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Intercessions of the Church, <lb/>
and to partake of all the Graces of God's Holy <lb/>
Spirit, <normalised orig="implor'd" auto="true">implored</normalised> on their behalf; that God <lb/>
who has begun a good work in them <lb/>
may perfect it till the day of Christ; and <lb/>
that I my self at that <normalised orig="dreadfull" auto="true">dreadful</normalised> day, may render <lb/>
an account of you with joy. <lb/>
How much the Catechism of our Church <lb/>
may conduce to so desirable an end, you will <lb/>
in some measure judge by the following Explication, <lb/>
as imperfect as it is, and which, <lb/>
by God's <normalised orig="gratious" auto="true">gracious</normalised> <normalised orig="assistence" auto="true">assistance</normalised>, I have so <normalised orig="contriv'd" auto="true">contrived</normalised>, <lb/>
that at one and the same time, it may <lb/>
both inform your understanding, and raise <lb/>
your affections; and that it might the better <lb/>
<normalised orig="sute" auto="true">suit</normalised> with every ones <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>le*sure</sic>
                     <corr><normalised orig="leasure" auto="true">leisure</normalised></corr>
                  </choice> and infirmities, <lb/>
it is <normalised orig="Pen'd" auto="true">Penned</normalised> in short Forms of Devotion, to be <lb/>
<normalised orig="us'd" auto="true">used</normalised> in whole, or in part; in separate Collects <lb/>
or Ejaculations, or occasionally, as your Spiritual <lb/>
necessities shall require. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
God of his infinite mercy bless the whole, <lb/>
to his own Glory, and to your Edification, <lb/>
through Jesus the Beloved. Amen, Amen.<lb/>
