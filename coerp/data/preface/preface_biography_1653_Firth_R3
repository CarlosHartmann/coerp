To the godly, <normalised orig="consciencious" auto="true">conscientious</normalised><lb/>
READER.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
IT is thy <normalised orig="priviledge" auto="true">privilege</normalised> for soul-advantage<lb/>
that thou livest amongst<lb/>
Sermons, and it is a choice mercy<lb/>
in the Saints Count-book that now<lb/>
when so many bid Preaching depart,<lb/>
and Ordinances depart, and Duties depart;<lb/>
yet still the Lord is not wanting to appear<lb/>
(in some <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> or other) owning his appointments.<lb/>
Yea, thou mayst observe Jesus<lb/>
Christ to be so desirous of thy Company,<lb/>
that he leaves no means unattempted to win<lb/>
thy soul to God; for the <normalised orig="deare" auto="true">dear</normalised> love of Jesus<lb/>
Christ seems to flow and break over the<lb/>
banks of ordinary means, that so it may encompass<lb/>
thy heart, and fetch thee wholly into<lb/>
the Father. Now surely, Christian, thou<lb/>
wilt confess, that it's a barren soul indeed<lb/>
whom the over-flowings of Christs love will<lb/>
not make fruitful. Believe it, Gods unwonted<lb/>
layings out of Love are not answered<lb/>
with stinted and wonted layings out of<lb/>
obedience. Great cost and little incomes is<lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
unprofitable trading. When the Lord <choice ana="illegible">

Now, thou to whom this Book shall come,<lb/>

Lord in this <normalised orig="Childe-Preacher" auto="false">Child-Preacher</normalised>; and if thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised><lb/>
not spell Christs meaning by his words, yet put<lb/>
together Words and Works, and thou shalt<lb/>

why the life of nature should be continued,<lb/>
except it were that the life of grace might be<lb/>
prolonged; but this we found, that the continuance<lb/>

and did preach forth the wonderful power<lb/>
and love of Jesus Christ; as if she had learnt<lb/>
a new and holy Art of living poor souls to God;<lb/>
or as if Faith were to come by seeing. Gracious<lb/>
<normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised>! who for her age might be a<lb/>
Learner, and yet is made so learned a Teacher,<lb/>
who so sweetly takes Christ for her text truth<lb/>
for her Doctrine, and Holiness for her <normalised orig="Vse" auto="true">Use</normalised>.<lb/>

                  <lb/>
Surely <normalised orig="'t" auto="false">it</normalised> was he who at 12 years old was found<lb/>
in the Temple, sitting amongst the Doctors, hearing<lb/>
of them, and asking of them Questions,<lb/>
<normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> he (I say) who <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> ranked this Twelve<lb/>
years-old <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised> amongst the Doctors of our<lb/>
Israel. <normalised orig="'Twas" auto="true">It was</normalised> he that made her Sermons,<lb/>
she <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> did but preach them: For her<lb/>
Speech <normalised orig="bewrayed" auto="false">betrayed</normalised> she had been with Jesus.<lb/>
Oh what gracious words she uttered! nothing<lb/>
but honey <normalised orig="dropt" auto="true">dropped</normalised> from her mouth, and<lb/>
that such honey as tasted much of the <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised><lb/>
Canaan. And indeed, Christian, none<lb/>
can speak so heavenlily, none so healingly,<lb/>
none so sweetly, none so feelingly, as those<lb/>
that have much of God speaking in them.<lb/>
The Sentences she uttered are in this Book<lb/>
recorded. And now <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> thou read, and<lb/>
not wonder; wonder, and not desire to<lb/>
read? And yet the manner of her speaking<lb/>
added Emphasis to the things she <normalised orig="spake" auto="true">spoke</normalised>. Her<lb/>
eyes were fixed, as if she saw Christ; her<lb/>
countenance <normalised orig="cheerfull" auto="true">cheerful</normalised>, as if she <normalised orig="imbraced" auto="true">embraced</normalised><lb/>
Christ; her lips smiling, as if she kissed<lb/>
Christ; yea, her <normalised orig="armes" auto="true">arms</normalised> sometimes sweetly<lb/>
clasping, as if with Simeon she had got an<lb/>
arm-ful of Christ.<lb/>
What think you meant her soul, <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised><lb/>
her body used such an action? Oh what <normalised orig="happinesse" auto="true">happiness</normalised><lb/>
for a poor soul to lose it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> in the<lb/>

                  <lb/>
All-fulnesse of Christ! truly, these things<lb/>
made us all cry out, <quote type="biblical" ana="Lk 1.66">What manner of <normalised orig="Childe" auto="true">Child</normalised><lb/>
shall this be?</quote> But oh see the <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised><lb/>
workings of our God. He has let her come<lb/>
down into this lower room <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>. God<lb/>
seemed to take her out of the crowd into<lb/>
his Chambers up above, where he sweetly<lb/>
whispered his <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> unto her; and now he<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> sent her back again, that she may live<lb/>
over her own Sermons. And yet so was<lb/>
God taken with her company, that he would<lb/>
not let her come down again, till his Children<lb/>
had petitioned again &amp; again for her.<lb/>
And then the more to endear his mercy to<lb/>
us, he sends her down in the <normalised orig="Armes" auto="true">Arms</normalised> of Prayer.<lb/>
So that now we <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> this truth in our<lb/>

highest when he is on his knees. I might speak<lb/>

grace then gracious persons. Oh let<lb/>
this (I beseech thee) with the other soul-helps<lb/>
Christ <normalised orig="affordeth" auto="true">affords</normalised> thee, prevail with thee<lb/>

I <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> indeed, the Winter of Religion<lb/>

Oh! be not thou one, who shalt keep off<lb/>
