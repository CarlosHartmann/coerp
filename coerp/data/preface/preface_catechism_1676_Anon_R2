               <head>THE <lb/>
PREFACE.</head>

                  <lb/>

Reader, <lb/>
THE true intent of this Catechism is to instruct men in <lb/>
the duties and principles of Christianity: it contains <lb/>
no jejune notions, to <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>s*a*e pers*ns</sic>
                     <corr>scare persons</corr>
                  </choice> of whatever <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised> <lb/>
from reading of it; it being <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*nly</sic>
                     <corr>only</corr>
                  </choice> a brief <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>C*mpendium</sic>
                     <corr>Compendium</corr>
                  </choice> of those <lb/>
Duties which are scattered in the Scriptures. I confess it <lb/>
was chiefly intended for the benefit of the younger sort, that <lb/>
they might be early acquainted with their duty from the Scriptures, <lb/>
which are able to make them wise unto Salvation: <lb/>
but I am <normalised orig="hopefull" auto="true">hopeful</normalised> it <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>s*all</sic>
                     <corr>shall</corr>
                  </choice> also prove of general use. <lb/>
I am not ignorant how it is now become a fashion to <normalised orig="alledg" auto="true">allege</normalised> <lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>Scripture-auth*rity</sic>
                     <corr>Scripture-authority</corr>
                  </choice> for the defence of every opinion, be it never <lb/>
so monstrous. But this cheat being so easily discovered, I am <lb/>
<normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> men will not reject the plain doctrines of Scripture. <lb/>
I have not made use of controverted texts, neither have <lb/>
I imposed my own comment upon any mans belief. In the First <lb/>
Part I have very briefly laid down only these Principles that <lb/>
are undoubtable amongst the best Reformed part of Christendom, <lb/>
and which very fairly consist with the practice of <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> <lb/>
and <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>m*rality</sic>
                     <corr>morality</corr>
                  </choice>. In the Second Part I have laid down these <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>Du*es</sic>
                     <corr>Duties</corr>
                  </choice>, <lb/>
which every mans understanding will tell him are unquestionable; <lb/>
they being indeed the plain duties of morality; <lb/>
of which I may say, as it is, Luke 10. 28. <quote type="biblical" ana="Lk 10.28">This do, and <lb/>
thou shalt live.</quote> As for those private devotions in the close, <lb/>
I have laid them down in Scripture-expressions, because the <lb/>
style of the Holy Ghost is undoubtedly the fittest for spiritual <lb/>
services; so that I may say of it, as David of Goliah's Sword, <lb/>
there is none like it. <lb/>
I shall conclude with my advice to Parents and children. <lb/>
Parents, surely it is your duty to provide for the education of <lb/>
your children. Under the old dispensation, Parents were commanded <lb/>
to teach their children diligently the statutes and <lb/>
commandments of God: And this is expressed in the New <lb/>
Testament, by bringing them up in the nurture and admonition <lb/>
of the Lord. It was the advice and counsel of the <lb/>
wise man, Prov.22.6. <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 22.6">Train up a child in the way he should <lb/>
go; and when he is old he will not depart from it.</quote> If <lb/>
Parents neglect to instruct their children in the ways of God, <lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
children will, without <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>d*ffi*lty</sic>
                     <corr>difficulty</corr>
                  </choice>, train up themselves in the <lb/>
practice of vice and <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>imm*rality</sic>
                     <corr>immorality</corr>
                  </choice>. And it is certain, accordingly <lb/>
as they are at first seasoned, they will retain that savour. <lb/>
O the heinous guilt that many Parents bring upon themselves <lb/>
by this neglect; and the lamentable misery they bring upon  <lb/>
their children! I wish I could say that this <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not been the <lb/>
great cause of those monstrous impieties that so much abound <lb/>
amongst us. As for children, it is undoubtedly their duty to <lb/>
hearken to the instruction of their Parents, except it be such <lb/>
as cause to err. If indeed Parents shall be so cruel to their <lb/>
children, as to mislead them, and only teach them their own <lb/>
self-chosen opinions, and not the statutes and commandments <lb/>
of God; I must pity the case of <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>th*<normalised orig="se" auto="true">see</normalised></sic>
                     <corr>those</corr>
                  </choice> children, and desire <lb/>
them to hearken to the Psalmist's advice, <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 34. 11. <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 34.11-14">Come <lb/>
<normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the fear <lb/>
of the Lord. What man is he that <normalised orig="desireth" auto="true">desires</normalised> life, and <normalised orig="loveth" auto="true">loves</normalised> <lb/>
many days, that he may see good? keep thy tongue from <lb/>
evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil, <lb/>
and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.</quote>
