II. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven<lb/>
image, or any <normalised orig="likenesse" auto="true">likeness</normalised> of any thing that is in heaven<lb/>
above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in<lb/>
the water under the earth; thou shalt not bow down<lb/>
thy self to them, nor serve them: For I the LORD<lb/>
thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of<lb/>
the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth<lb/>
generation of them that hate me: and <normalised orig="shewing" auto="true">showing</normalised> mercy<lb/>
unto thousands of them that love me and keep my<lb/>
<normalised orig="Commandements" auto="true">Commandments</normalised>.<lb/>
III. Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD<lb/>
thy God in vain: For the LORD will not hold him<lb/>
<normalised orig="guiltlesse" auto="true">guiltless</normalised> that <normalised orig="taketh" auto="true">takes</normalised> his name in vain.<lb/>
IV. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy:<lb/>
Six <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> shalt thou labour &amp; do all thy work; but the<lb/>
               <pb n="18"/>
               <lb/>
seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy God,<lb/>
in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor<lb/>
thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant,<lb/>
nor thy <normalised orig="cattell" auto="true">cattle</normalised>, nor thy stranger that is within thy<lb/>
gates: For in six <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> the LORD made heaven and<lb/>
earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh<lb/>
day, wherefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath<lb/>
day, and hallowed it.<lb/>
V. Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy<lb/>
<normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> may be long upon the land which the LORD<lb/>
thy God <normalised orig="giveth" auto="true">gives</normalised> thee.<lb/>
VI. Thou shalt not kill.<lb/>
VII. Thou shalt not commit adultery.<lb/>
VIII. Thou shalt not steal.<lb/>
IX. Thou shalt not bear false <normalised orig="witnesse" auto="true">witness</normalised> against thy<lb/>
neighbour.<lb/>
X. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbours house,<lb/>
thou shalt not covet thy neighbours wife, nor his<lb/>
man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his <normalised orig="oxe" auto="true">ox</normalised>, nor his<lb/>
<normalised orig="asse" auto="true">ass</normalised>, nor any thing that is thy neighbours.</quote>

SO much of every Question, both in the larger and
shorter <normalised orig="Catechisme" auto="true">Catechism</normalised>, is repeated in the Answer, as <normalised orig="maketh" auto="true">makes</normalised>
every Answer an entire Proposition, or sentence, in it self:
to the end the Learner may further improve it upon all occasions,
for his increase in knowledge and piety, even out
of the course of catechising, as well as in it.
And albeit the substance of the doctrine comprised in
that abridgement commonly called, The Apostles Creed, be
fully set forth in each of the <normalised orig="Catechismes" auto="false">Catechisms</normalised>, so as there is no
necessity of inserting the Creed it self, yet it is here annexed,
not as though it were composed by the Apostles,
or ought to be esteemed <normalised orig="Canonicall" auto="true">Canonical</normalised> Scripture, as the ten
<normalised orig="Commandements" auto="true">Commandments</normalised>, and the Lords Prayer, (much <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> a
Prayer, as ignorant people have been apt to make both it
and the Decalogue,) but because it is a brief <normalised orig="summe" auto="true">sum</normalised> of the
Christian faith, agreeable to the Word of God, and <notvariant>anciently</notvariant>
received in the Churches of Christ.
