THe Heart of man is his worst <lb/>
part before it be regenerate, <lb/>
and the best afterwards; It is <lb/>
the seat of Principles, and fountain <lb/>
of Actions. The eye of God is, and <lb/>
the eye of the Christian ought to be, <lb/>
principally fixed upon it. <lb/>
The greatest difficulty in Conversion <lb/>
is to win the heart to God, and the greatest <lb/>
difficulty after Conversion is to keep <lb/>
the heart with God. Here lies the very <lb/>
pinch and stress of Religion; here's that <lb/>
that makes the way to life a narrow <lb/>
way, and the Gate of Heaven a straight <lb/>
Gate. Direction and help in this great <lb/>
work, is the scope and <normalised orig="summe" auto="true">sum</normalised> of this <lb/>
Text; wherein we have. <lb/>
1. An Exhortation, Keep thy heart <lb/>
with all diligence. <lb/>
2. The Reason or Motive <normalised orig="inforcing" auto="true">enforcing</normalised> it, <lb/>
For out of it are the issues of Life. <lb/>
In the Exhortation I shall Consider, <lb/>

1. The Matter of the Duty. <lb/>
2. The manner of performing it. <lb/>
1. The Matter of the Duty; Keep thy <lb/>
Heart. Heart is not here taken properly <lb/>
for that noble part of the Body which <lb/>
Philosophers call the primum vivens, &amp; <lb/>
                  ultimum moriens; the first that lives, and <lb/>
the last that dies; but by Heart in a Metaphor, <lb/>
the Scripture sometimes understands <lb/>
some particular noble <normalised orig="facultie" auto="true">faculty</normalised> of <lb/>
the Soul, in <normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>. 1. 21. it is put for the <lb/>
understanding part, their foolish Heart <lb/>
(i.e.) <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 1.21">their foolish Understanding was <lb/>
darkened</quote>. And <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 119. 11. It is put <lb/>
for the Memory, <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 119.11">Thy Word have I hid in <lb/>
my Heart</quote>. And John 1. 3. 20 It is put for <lb/>
the Conscience, which <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> in it both the <lb/>
light of Understanding, and the recognitions <lb/>
of the Memory: <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Jn 3.20">If our heart <lb/>
Condemn us</quote>, (i.e.) if our Conscience; <lb/>
whose proper Office it is to condemn. <lb/>
But here we are to take it more generally <lb/>
for the whole Soul or inner Man; for <lb/>
look what the Heart is to the Body, that <lb/>
the Soul is to the Man: and what Health <lb/>
is to the Heart; that Holiness is to the <lb/>
Soul: Quod sanitas in corpore, id sanctitas <lb/>
in <normalised orig="corde" auto="true">cord</normalised>. The state of the whole Body depends <lb/>
upon the soundness and vigour of <lb/>
the Heart, and the everlasting state of the <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
whole man upon the good or ill condition <lb/>
of the Soul. <lb/>
And by keeping the Heart understand, <lb/>
the diligent and constant use and improvement <lb/>
of all holy Means and Duties to <lb/>
preserve the Soul from sin, and maintain <lb/>
its sweet and free communion with God. <lb/>
                  Lavater in loc. will have <lb/>
the word taken from a besieged <lb/>
Garrison, begirt by <lb/>
many Enemies without, <lb/>
and in danger of being betrayed <lb/>
by treacherous Citizens <lb/>
within, in which <lb/>
danger the <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised> upon <lb/>
pain of death are commanded <lb/>
to watch: and <lb/>
whereas the expression, <lb/>
(keep thy heart) seems to <lb/>
put it upon us as <choice ana="print-error">

                     <corr>our work</corr>

yet it <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not imply a <lb/>
sufficiency or ability in us <lb/>
to do it; we are as able to <lb/>
stop the Sun in its course, <lb/>
or make the Rivers run <lb/>
backward, as by our own skill and power <lb/>
to rule and order our hearts: we may as <lb/>
well be our own Saviours, as our own <lb/>
Keepers, and yet Solomon speaks properly <lb/>
enough, when he saith, <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 4.23">keep thy <lb/>

no power, a gracious man <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> some; <lb/>
though not sufficient, and that power he <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> depends upon the exciting and assisting <lb/>
strength of Christ; Gratia gratiam <lb/>
postulat, Grace within us is beholding to <lb/>
Grace without us, John 15. 5. <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 15.5">Without me <lb/>
<normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> can do nothing.</quote> So much of the matter <lb/>

an evil man out of the evil treasury of his <lb/>

                  <lb/>
So then, if the heart <normalised orig="erre" auto="true">err</normalised> in its work, <lb/>
these must needs miscarry in theirs; for <lb/>
heart-errors are like the errors of the <lb/>
first concoction which cannot be rectified <lb/>
afterwards: Or like the mis-placing <lb/>
and inverting of the stamps and letters <lb/>
in the Press, which must needs cause so <lb/>
many errata's in all the Copies that are <lb/>
printed off. O then! how important a <lb/>
Duty is that which is contained in the <lb/>
following Proposition? <lb/>
Doct. That the keeping, and right managing <lb/>
of the heart in every condition, is the <lb/>
great business of a Christians life. <lb/>
What the Philosopher saith of waters <lb/>
is as properly applicable to hearts, suis <lb/>
terminis difficile continentur; <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> hard to <lb/>
keep them within any bounds: God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
set bounds and limits to them, yet how <lb/>
frequently do they transgress. not only <lb/>
the bounds of Grace and Religion, but <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="6">B 3</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
even of Reason and common Honesty; <lb/>
                  Hic <normalised orig="labor" auto="true">labour</normalised> hoc opus est, this is that which <lb/>
affords the Christian matter of labour, <lb/>
fear and trembling to his dying day. <normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> <lb/>
not the cleansing of the hand that makes <lb/>
a Christian, for many a Hypocrite can <lb/>
<normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> as fair a hand as he, but the purifying, <lb/>
watching, and right ordering of <lb/>
the heart; this is the thing that provokes <lb/>
so many sad complaints, and costs so many <lb/>
deep groans and brinish tears. <normalised orig="'Twas" auto="true">It was</normalised> <lb/>
the pride of Hezekiah's heart that made <lb/>
him <normalised orig="lye" auto="true">lie</normalised> in the dust mourning before the <lb/>
Lord, 2 Chron. 32. 26. <normalised orig="'Twas" auto="true">It was</normalised> the fear <lb/>
of <normalised orig="Hypocrisie" auto="true">Hypocrisy</normalised> invading the heart, that <lb/>
made David cry, <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 119.80">Let my heart be sound in <lb/>
thy Statutes that I be not ashamed</quote>, <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 119. <lb/>
80. <normalised orig="'Twas" auto="true">It was</normalised> the sad experience he had of <lb/>
the Divisions and Distractions of his <lb/>
own heart in the Service of God, that <lb/>
made him pour out that Prayer, <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 86. <lb/>
11. <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 86.11">Unite my heart to fear thy Name.</quote>
                  <lb/>
The Method in which I shall improve <lb/>
the Point, shall be this. <lb/>
1. First I shall inquire what the keeping <lb/>
of the heart supposes and imports. <lb/>
2. Secondly, Assign divers Reasons, <lb/>
why Christians must make this the great <lb/>
work and business of their lives. <lb/>
3. Thirdly, Point at those special seasons <lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
which especially call for <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic><normalised orig="thi" auto="true">thy</normalised>*</sic>
                     <corr>this</corr>
                  </choice> diligence <lb/>
in keeping the heart. <lb/>
4. Fourthly and lastly, apply the <lb/>
whole in several uses. <lb/>
1. What the keeping of the Heart supposes <lb/>
and imports. <lb/>
To keep the heart necessarily supposes <lb/>
a previous work of Sanctification; which <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> set the heart right by giving it a <lb/>
new Spiritual bent and inclination, for as <lb/>
long as the heart is not set right by Grace, <lb/>
as to its habitual frame, no Duties or <lb/>
Means can keep it right with God. Self <lb/>
is the Poise of the unsanctified heart, <lb/>
which <normalised orig="Byasses" auto="true">Biases</normalised> and moves it in all its designs <lb/>
and actions; and as long as it is so, <lb/>
it is impossible that any external means <lb/>
should keep it with God. <lb/>
Man by Creation was of one constant <lb/>
uniform frame and <normalised orig="tenour" auto="true">tenor</normalised> of Spirit, held <lb/>
one straight and even course; not one <lb/>
thought or faculty <normalised orig="ravell'd" auto="false">ravelled</normalised> or <normalised orig="disorder'd" auto="true">disordered</normalised>, <lb/>
his <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> had a perfect illumination to <lb/>
understand and know the will of God, <lb/>
his will a perfect compliance therewith, <lb/>
his sensitive appetite and other <normalised orig="inferiour" auto="true">inferior</normalised> <lb/>
powers, stood in a most obedient subordination. <lb/>
Man by degeneration is become a <lb/>
most disordered and rebellious Creature, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="8">B 4</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
contesting with, and opposing his Maker, <lb/>
as the first cause, by self <normalised orig="dependance" auto="true">dependence</normalised>; as <lb/>
the chiefest good, by self-love; as the highest <lb/>
Lord, by self will; and as the last end, <lb/>
by self-seeking; and so is quite disordered, <lb/>
and all his acts irregular: His illuminated <lb/>
understanding is clouded with <lb/>
ignorance, his complying will, full of <lb/>
rebellion and <normalised orig="stubbornnesse" auto="true">stubbornness</normalised>; his subordinate <lb/>
powers, casting off the dominion and <lb/>
government of the <normalised orig="superiour" auto="true">superior</normalised> faculties. <lb/>
But by Regeneration, this disordered <lb/>
Soul is set right again, Sanctification being <lb/>
the rectifying, and due framing, or as <lb/>
the Scripture phrases it, the renovation <lb/>
of the Soul after the Image of God, Eph. <lb/>
4. 24. in which, self <normalised orig="dependance" auto="true">dependence</normalised> is removed <lb/>
by Faith; self-love, by the love of God; <lb/>
self will, by subjection and obedience to <lb/>
the Will of God; and self-seeking, by <normalised orig="selfdenyal" auto="false">self-denial</normalised>. <lb/>
The <normalised orig="darkned" auto="true">darkened</normalised> understanding is <lb/>
again illuminated, Eph. 1. 18. the refractory <lb/>
will sweetly subdued, <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 110. 3. <lb/>
the rebellious appetite, or concupiscence, <lb/>
gradually conquered, <normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>. 6. 7. per tot. <lb/>
And thus the Soul which sin had universally <lb/>
depraved, is again by grace restored <lb/>
and rectified. <lb/>
This being presupposed, it will not be <lb/>
difficult to apprehend, what it is to keep <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="9">8</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
the heart, which is nothing else but the <lb/>
constant care and diligence of such a renewed <lb/>
man, to preserve his soul in that holy frame <lb/>
to which Grace <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> reduced it, and daily <lb/>
strives to hold it. <lb/>
For though grace <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> in great measure <lb/>
rectified the Soul, and given it an <lb/>
habitual heavenly temper; yet Sin <lb/>
often actually discomposes it again; so <lb/>
that even a gracious heart is like a musical <lb/>
Instrument, which though it be never <lb/>
so exactly tuned, a small matter <lb/>
brings it out of tune again; yea hang it <lb/>
aside but a little and it will need setting <lb/>
again, before you can play another Lesson <lb/>
on it: even so stands the case with <lb/>
gracious hearts; if they are in frame in <lb/>
one duty, yet how dull, dead and disordered, <lb/>
when they come to another: and <lb/>
therefore every duty needs a particular <lb/>
preparation of the heart, Job 11. 13. <quote type="biblical" ana="Job 11.13">If <lb/>
thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thy <lb/>
hands towards him</quote>: Well then, to keep <lb/>

                  </choice>, is carefully to preserve it from <lb/>
sin which disorders it; and maintain that <lb/>
spiritual and gracious frame which fits it <lb/>
for a life of communion with God: and <lb/>
this includes these six acts in it. <lb/>
1. First, frequent observation of the <lb/>
frame of the heart, turning in and examining <lb/>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
how the case stands with it; this <lb/>
is one part of the work. Carnal and formal <lb/>
persons take no heed to this, they <lb/>
cannot be brought to confer with their <lb/>
own hearts; there are some men and women <lb/>
that have lived forty or fifty years <lb/>
in the world, and have scarce had one <lb/>
hours discourse with their own hearts all <lb/>
that while: <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> an hard thing to bring a <lb/>
man and himself together upon such an <lb/>
account; but Saints know those Soliloquies <lb/>
and self-conferences to be of excellent <lb/>
use and advantage. The Heathen <lb/>
could say, anima sedendo &amp; quiescendo fit<lb/>
sapiens, the Soul is made wise by sitting <lb/>
still in quietness; though <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>Bankrup*s</sic>
                     <corr>Bankrupts</corr>
                  </choice> care <lb/>
not to look into their Books of <normalised orig="accompt" auto="true">account</normalised>, <lb/>
yet upright hearts will know whether <lb/>
they go backward or forward, <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 77. <lb/>
6. <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 77.6">I commune with mine own heart</quote>; The <lb/>
heart can never be kept, until its case be <lb/>
examined and understood. <lb/>
2. It includes deep humiliations for <lb/>
heart evils and disorders; thus Hezekiah <lb/>
humbled himself for the pride of his <lb/>
heart, 2 Chron. 32. 26. Thus the people <lb/>
were ordered to spread forth their <lb/>
hands to God in Prayer in a sense of the <lb/>
Plague of their own hearts, 1 Kings 8. 38. <lb/>
Upon this account many an upright <lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
heart <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been laid low before God: O <lb/>
What an heart have I? they have in their <lb/>
confessions pointed at the heart; the pained <lb/>
place, Lord here is the wound, here <lb/>
is the Plague-sore; it is with the heart <lb/>
well kept, as it is with the eye, which is a <lb/>
fit emblem of it, if a small dust get into <lb/>
the eye, it will never leave twinkling <lb/>
and watering, till it have wept it out: So <lb/>
the upright heart cannot be at rest till it <lb/>
have wept out its troubles, and poured <lb/>
out its complaints before the Lord. <lb/>
3. It includes earnest Supplications <lb/>
and instant Prayer for heart-purifying <lb/>
and rectifying Grace, when sin <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> defiled <lb/>
and disordered it; so <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 19. 12. <lb/>
                  <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 19.12">Cleanse thou me from secret faults</quote>, and <lb/>
<normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 86. 11. <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 86.11">Unite my heart to fear thy <lb/>
Name.</quote> Saints have always many such <lb/>
Petitions depending before the Throne <lb/>
of Grace; this is the thing which is most <lb/>
pleaded by them with God: when they <lb/>
are praying for outward mercies, happily <lb/>
their spirits may be more remiss, but <lb/>
when it comes to the heart-case, then <lb/>
they intend their spirits to the utmost, <lb/>
fill their mouths with Arguments, weep <lb/>
and make supplication; Oh, for a better <lb/>
heart! Oh, for a heart to love God <lb/>
more! To hate Sin more, to walk more <lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
evenly with God; Lord deny not to me<lb/>
such a heart, what ever thou deny me; <lb/>
Give me an heart to fear thee, love and <lb/>
delight in thee, if I beg my bread in desolate <lb/>
places. <normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> observed of holy Mr. <lb/>
Bradford, that when he was confessing <lb/>
sin, he would never give over <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>conf*ssing</sic>
                     <corr>confessing</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
until he had felt some brokeness of heart <lb/>
for that sin, and when praying for any <lb/>
Spiritual mercy, would never give over <lb/>
that suite, till he had got some relish of <lb/>
that mercy; that's the third thing included <lb/>
in keeping the heart. <lb/>
4. It includes the imposing of strong <lb/>
<normalised orig="ingagements" auto="true">engagements</normalised> and bonds upon our selves <lb/>
to walk more accurately with God, and <lb/>
avoid the occasions whereby the heart <lb/>
may be induced to sin: Well composed, <lb/>
advised, and deliberate Vows are in some <lb/>
cases of excellent use to guard the heart <lb/>
against some special sin, So Job 31. 1. <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Job 31.1">I made a covenant with mine eyes</quote>; by this <lb/>
means, holy ones have over-awed their <lb/>
souls, and preserved themselves from defilement <lb/>
by some special heart-corruptions. <lb/>
5. It includes a constant holy <normalised orig="jealousie" auto="true">jealousy</normalised> <lb/>
over our own hearts, quick-sighted <lb/>
<normalised orig="self-jealousie" auto="false">self-jealousy</normalised> is an excellent preservative <lb/>
from sin; he that will keep his heart, <lb/>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
must have the eyes of his soul awake and <lb/>
open upon all the disorderly, and tumultuous <lb/>
stirrings of his affections, if the affections <lb/>
break loose, and the passions be <lb/>
stirred, the Soul must discover and suppress <lb/>
them before they get to an height: <lb/>
O my Soul, <normalised orig="dost" auto="false">do</normalised> thou well in this? My <lb/>
tumultuous thoughts and passions where <lb/>
is your Commission? State viri, quae causa <lb/>
viae? quive estis in armis. Virg. <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 28.14">Happy is the man that thus <normalised orig="feareth" auto="true">fears</normalised> <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised></quote>, <lb/>
Prov. 28. 14. By this fear of the <lb/>
Lord it is that men depart from evil, <lb/>

                     <sic>sh*ke</sic>

from iniquity; he that will keep <lb/>
his heart must feed with fear, <normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised> <lb/>
with fear, and pass the whole time of <lb/>
his sojourning here in fear, and all little <lb/>
enough to keep the heart from Sin. <lb/>
6. And lastly, To add no more, it includes <lb/>
the realizing of Gods Presence <lb/>
with us, and setting the Lord <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> <lb/>
before us: this the people of God have <lb/>
found a singular means <choice ana="illegible">

                     <corr>to</corr>
                  </choice> keep their <lb/>
hearts upright, and awe them from sin: <lb/>
when the eye of our Faith is fixed upon <lb/>
the eye of Gods Omniscience, we dare <lb/>
not let out our thoughts and affections to <lb/>
vanity: Holy Job durst not suffer his <lb/>
heart to <normalised orig="yeild" auto="true">yield</normalised> to an impure, vain thought, <lb/>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
and what was it that moved him to so <lb/>
great a Circumspection? Why he tells <lb/>
you, Job. 31. 4. <quote type="biblical" ana="Job 31.4"><normalised orig="Doth" auto="true">Does</normalised> he not see my <normalised orig="waies" auto="true">ways</normalised> <lb/>
and count all my steps?</quote>
                  <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Gen 17.1">Walk before me</quote>
                  <lb/>
(saith God to Abraham) <quote type="biblical" ana="Gen 17.1">and be thou perfect</quote>, <lb/>
Gen. 17. 1. Even as Parents use to <lb/>
set their Children in the Congregation <lb/>
before them, knowing that else they will <lb/>
be toying and playing; so would the <lb/>
heart of the best man too, were it not for <lb/>
the eye of God. <lb/>
In these and such like particulars, do <lb/>
gracious souls express the care they have <lb/>
of their hearts; they are as careful to prevent <lb/>
the breaking loose of their corruptions <lb/>
in times of temptation, as Sea-men <lb/>
are to <normalised orig="binde" auto="true">bind</normalised> fast the Guns that they break <lb/>
not loose in a storm; as careful to preserve <lb/>
the sweetness and comfort they <lb/>
have got from God in any duty, as one <lb/>
that comes out of an hot Bath, or great <lb/>
sweat is of taking cold, by going forth into <lb/>
the chill <normalised orig="aire" auto="true">air</normalised>; this is the work, and of <lb/>
all works in Religion it is the most difficult, <lb/>
constant, and important work. <lb/>
1. <normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> the hardest work; Heart-work <lb/>
is hard work indeed: To shuffle over Religious- <lb/>
Duties with a loose and heedless <lb/>
Spirit, will cost no great pains; but to set <lb/>
thyself before the Lord, and <normalised orig="tye" auto="true">tie</normalised> up thy <lb/>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
loose and vain thoughts to a constant and <lb/>
serious attendance upon him; this will <lb/>
cost thee something: to attain a facility <lb/>
and dexterity of language in Prayer, <lb/>
and put thy meaning into apt and decent <lb/>
expressions is <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised>, but to get thy heart <lb/>
broken for sin whilst thou art confessing <lb/>
it; melted with free grace, whilst thou <lb/>
art blessing God for it; to be really ashamed <lb/>
and humbled through the apprehensions <lb/>
of Gods infinite holiness, and <lb/>
to keep thy heart in this frame, not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <lb/>
in, but after Duty; will surely cost thee <lb/>
some groans, and travelling pains of soul: <lb/>
to <normalised orig="represse" auto="true">repress</normalised> the outward acts of sin, and <lb/>
compose the external part of thy life in <lb/>
a laudable and comely manner is no <lb/>
great matter, even carnal persons by the <lb/>
force of common principles can do this; <lb/>
but to kill the root of corruption within, <lb/>
to set and keep up an holy Government <lb/>
over thy thoughts, to have all things <normalised orig="lye" auto="true">lie</normalised> <lb/>
straight and orderly in the heart, this is <lb/>
not <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised>. <lb/>
2. <normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> a Constant work, the keeping <lb/>
of the heart is such a work, as is never <lb/>
done till life be done; this labour and <lb/>
our life end together: It is with a Christian <lb/>

3. <normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> the most important business <lb/>
of a Christians life; without this we are <lb/>
but Formalists in Religion: all our Professions, <lb/>
Gifts and Duties, <normalised orig="signifie" auto="true">signify</normalised> nothing: <lb/>

which is indeed a debt; he will put this <lb/>
honour upon the Creature to receive it <lb/>
from him in the way of a gift, but if this <lb/>
be not given him he regards not what <lb/>
ever else you bring to him: there is so <lb/>
much only of worth and value in what <lb/>
we do, as there is of Heart in it: Concerning <lb/>
the Heart, God seems to say as <lb/>

                  <lb/>
Joseph of Benjamin, If you bring not Benjamin <lb/>
with you, <quote type="biblical" ana="Gen 43.3">you shall not see my face</quote>. Among <lb/>
the Heathens when the Beast was <lb/>
cut up for sacrifice, the first thing the <lb/>
Priest <normalised orig="lookt" auto="true">looked</normalised> upon was the Heart, and if <lb/>
that were unsound and <normalised orig="naught" auto="true">nought</normalised>, the Sacrifice <lb/>
was rejected. God rejects all duties <lb/>
(how glorious <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised> in other respects) <lb/>
offered him without a heart: <lb/>
He that performs duty without a heart, <lb/>
viz. <normalised orig="heedlesly" auto="true">heedlessly</normalised>, is no more accepted with <lb/>
God then he that performs it with a <lb/>
double heart, viz. hypocritically, Isa. <lb/>
66. 3. And thus I have briefly opened <lb/>
the nature of the Duty, what is imported <lb/>
in this phrase, <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 4.23">Keep thy heart</quote>. <lb/>
2. Next, I shall give you some rational <lb/>
account, why Christians should <lb/>
make this the great business of their <lb/>
lives, to keep their hearts? <lb/>
The importance and necessity of making <lb/>
this our great and main business, <lb/>
will manifestly appear in that, 1. The <lb/>
honour of God. 2. The sincerity of our <lb/>
profession. 3. The beauty of our conversation. <lb/>
4. The comfort of our Souls. <lb/>
5. The improvement of our graces: <lb/>
and 6. Our stability in the hour of <lb/>
temptation; are all <normalised orig="wrapt" auto="true">wrapped</normalised> up in, and <lb/>
dependent on our sincerity and care <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="18">C</fw>
                  <pb n="17"/>
                  <lb/>
in the management in this work. <lb/>
1. The Glory of God is much concerned <lb/>
therein; heart-evils are very <lb/>
provoking evils to the Lord. The Schools <lb/>
do well observe, that outward sins are <lb/>
                  majoris infamiae, sins of greater infamy, <lb/>
but heart-sins are majoris reatus, sins of <lb/>
deeper guilt. How severely <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> the <lb/>
Great God declared his wrath from <lb/>
Heaven against heart-wickedness? The <lb/>
great Crime for which the old World <lb/>
stands indicted, Gen. 6. 5, 6, 7. is heart-wickedness; <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Gen 6.5">God saw that every imagination</quote>
                  <lb/>
(or fiction) <quote type="biblical" ana="Gen 6.5">of their heart was <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <lb/>
evil, and that continually</quote>: for which he <lb/>
sent the dreadfullest Judgment that was <lb/>
ever executed since the World began: <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Gen 5.7">And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom <lb/>
I have created from the face of the earth, <lb/>
both man and beast, and the creeping things, <lb/>
and the fowls of heaven, for it <normalised orig="repenteth" auto="true">repents</normalised> me <lb/>
that I have made man</quote>, v. 7. We find not <lb/>
their murders, adulteries; blasphemies, <lb/>
(though they were defiled with these) <lb/>
particularly <normalised orig="alledged" auto="true">alleged</normalised> against them; but <lb/>
the evils of their hearts: yea, that which <lb/>
God was so provoked by, as to give up <lb/>
his peculiar Inheritance into the enemies <lb/>
hand, was the evil of their hearts, <lb/>
Jer. 4. 14. <quote type="biblical" ana="Jer 4.14">O Jerusalem, wash thine heart <lb/>
                     <pb n="18"/>
                     <lb/>
from wickedness that thou <normalised orig="maist" auto="false">may</normalised> be saved, <lb/>
how long shall vain thoughts lodge within <lb/>
thee?</quote> The wickedness and vanity of <lb/>
their thoughts God took special notice <lb/>
of; and because of this the Caldean must <lb/>
come upon them as <quote type="biblical" ana="Jer 4.7">a Lion from his thickets</quote>, <lb/>
v. 7. and tear them to pieces. For the <lb/>
very sin of thoughts it was that God <lb/>
threw down the <normalised orig="faln" auto="true">fallen</normalised> Angels from Heaven, <lb/>
and keeps them still in everlasting <lb/>
chains to the judgment of the great day; <lb/>
by which expression is not obscurely <lb/>
intimated some extraordinary judgment <lb/>
to which they are reserved, as prisoners <lb/>
that have most irons laid upon them, may <lb/>
be supposed to be the greatest Malefactors: <lb/>
and what was their sin? Why, <lb/>
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> spiritual wickedness, for they having <lb/>
no bodily Organs could act nothing <lb/>
externally against God. Yea, <lb/>
<normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> heart-evils are so provoking, that <lb/>
for them he <choice ana="illegible">

the duties that some men perform unto <lb/>

                  <pb n="19"/>
                  <lb/>
more fully expressed by the holy God; <lb/>
Murder and Idolatry are not more vile <lb/>
in his account than their Sacrifices, <lb/>
though materially such as himself appointed: <lb/>
and what made them so? the <lb/>
following words inform us, <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 66.3">Their soul <lb/>
<normalised orig="delighteth" auto="true">delights</normalised> in their abominations.</quote>
                  <lb/>
To conclude, such is the vileness of <lb/>
<normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> heart-sins, that the Scriptures sometimes <lb/>
intimate the difficulty of pardon <lb/>
for them. So in the case of Simon Magus, <lb/>
Acts 8. 21. his heart was not right, <lb/>
he had vile thoughts of God, and the <lb/>
things of God, the Apostle bids him repent <lb/>
and pray, if perhaps the thoughts of his <lb/>
heart might be forgiven him. O then never <lb/>
slight heart-evils! for by these God <lb/>
is highly wronged and provoked, and <lb/>
for this reason, let every Christian make <lb/>
it his work to keep his heart with all diligence. <lb/>
2. The sincerity of our profession <lb/>
much depends upon the care and conscience <lb/>
we have in keeping our hearts; <lb/>
for it's most certain, that a man is but an <lb/>
hypocrite in his profession how curious <lb/>
<normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised> he be in the externals of Religion, <lb/>
that is heedless and careless of the frame <lb/>
of his heart: you have a pregnant instance <lb/>
of this in the case of <normalised orig="Jehu" auto="false">jesus</normalised>, 2 King. <lb/>
                  <pb n="20"/>
                  <lb/>
10. 31. <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Kings 10.31">But <normalised orig="Jehu" auto="false">jesus</normalised> took no heed to walk</quote> in the <lb/>
ways of the Lord God of Israel with his <lb/>
heart. That Context gives us an account <lb/>
of the great service <normalised orig="perform'd" auto="true">performed</normalised> by <normalised orig="Jehu" auto="false">jesus</normalised> <lb/>
against the house of Ahab and Baal, as <lb/>
also of a great temporal reward given <lb/>
him by God for that service, even that <lb/>
his Children to the fourth Generation <lb/>
should sit upon the Throne of Israel. <lb/>
And yet in these words <normalised orig="Jehu" auto="false">jesus</normalised> is censured <lb/>
for an hypocrite; though God approved <lb/>
and rewarded the work, yet he abhorred <lb/>
and rejected the person that did it as hypocritical: <lb/>
and wherein lay his <normalised orig="hypocrisie" auto="true">hypocrisy</normalised>? <lb/>
but in this, that he took no heed to <lb/>
walk in the ways of the Lord with his <lb/>
heart, (i.e.) he did all insincerely and <lb/>
for self-ends; and though the work he <lb/>
did were materially good, yet he not <lb/>
purging his heart from those unworthy <lb/>

                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
YOU have heard, that the keeping <lb/>
of the heart is the great work of a <lb/>
Christian in which the very Soul and <lb/>
life of Religion consists, and without <lb/>
which all other duties are of no value <lb/>
with God: hence then I shall infer to the <lb/>
consternation of hypocrites, and formal <lb/>
Professors. <lb/>
1. That the pains and labours which many <lb/>
persons have taken in religion, is but lost labour, <lb/>
and pains to no purpose, such as will <lb/>
never turn to account. <lb/>
Many great services have been performed, <lb/>
many glorious works are wrought <lb/>
by men, which yet are utterly rejected <lb/>
by God, and shall never stand upon record <lb/>
in order to an eternal <normalised orig="acceptation" auto="true">acceptance</normalised>, <lb/>
because they took no heed to keep their <lb/>
hearts with God in those duties: this is <lb/>
that fatal rock upon which thousands of <lb/>
vain professors have split themselves eternally, <lb/>
they are curious about the externals of <lb/>
religion, but regardless of their hearts. <lb/>
O how many hours have some Professors <lb/>
spent in hearing, praying, reading, <lb/>
conferring? and yet as to the main end <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="184">N 4</fw>
                  <pb n="35"/>
                  <lb/>
of religion, as good they had sate still <lb/>
and done nothing: for all this signifies <lb/>
nothing, the great work, I mean heart <lb/>
work; being all the while neglected: <lb/>
tell me thou vain professor, when <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> <lb/>
thou shed a <normalised orig="teare" auto="true">tear</normalised> for the deadness, hardness, <lb/>
unbelief, or earthliness of thy heart? <lb/>
<normalised orig="thinkst" auto="true">think</normalised> thou, such an <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> religion can <lb/>
save thee? if so, we may invert Christs <lb/>
words, and say, wide is the gate, and <lb/>
broad is the way, that <normalised orig="leadeth" auto="true">leads</normalised> to life; and <lb/>
many there be that <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> in thereat: hear <lb/>
me thou self deluding hypocrit, thou that <lb/>
<normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> put of God with <normalised orig="hartless" auto="false">heartless</normalised> duties, thou <lb/>
that <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> acted in religion as if thou <normalised orig="hadst" auto="true">had</normalised> <lb/>
been blessing an Idol, that could not <lb/>
search, and discover thy heart: thou that <lb/>
<normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> offered to God but the skin of the <lb/>
sacrifice, not the marrow, fat and inwards <lb/>
of it; how wilt thou abide the <lb/>
coming of the Lord? how wilt thou hold <lb/>
up thy head before him when he shall <lb/>
say, O thou dissembling false hearted <lb/>
man? how <normalised orig="couldst" auto="true">could</normalised> thou profess religion? <lb/>
with what face <normalised orig="couldst" auto="true">could</normalised> thou so often tell <lb/>
me, thou <normalised orig="lovedst" auto="true">loved</normalised> me, when thou <normalised orig="knewest" auto="false">knew</normalised> <lb/>
all the while in thine own conscience, <lb/>
that thine heart was not with me? O <lb/>
tremble to think, what a fearful judgment <lb/>
it is to be given over to a heedless <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="185">184</fw>
                  <pb n="36"/>
                  <lb/>
and careless heart: and then to have <lb/>
religious duties in stead of a rattle to quiet <lb/>
and still the Conscience! <lb/>
2. Hence I also infer for the humiliation <lb/>
even of upright hearts, that unless <lb/>
the people of God spend more time and pains <lb/>
about their hearts then generally and ordinarily <lb/>
they do, they are never like to do God <lb/>
much service, or be owners of much comfort <lb/>
in this World. <lb/>
I may say of that Christian that is <lb/>
remiss and careless in keeping his heart, <lb/>
as Jacob said of Reuben, <quote type="biblical" ana="Gen 49.4">Thou shalt not excel</quote>: <lb/>
It grieves me to see how many Christians <lb/>
there are that go up and down <lb/>
dejected and complaining, that live at a <lb/>
poor low rate;both of service and comfort, <lb/>
and how can they expect it should <lb/>
be otherwise as long as they live at such <lb/>
a careless rate? O how little of their <lb/>
time is spent in the closet, in searching, <lb/>
humbling, and <normalised orig="quickning" auto="true">quickening</normalised> their hearts? <lb/>
You say, your hearts are dead; and <lb/>
<normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> you wonder they are so as long as <lb/>
you keep them not with the fountain <lb/>
of life? if your bodies had been <normalised orig="diated" auto="false">dieted</normalised> as <lb/>
your Souls have been, they would have <lb/>
been dead too: never expect better <lb/>
hearts till you take more pains with <lb/>
them; qui fugit molam, fugit farinam: <lb/>
                  <pb n="37"/>
                  <lb/>
he that will not have the sweat, must not <lb/>
expect the sweet of Religion. <lb/>
O Christians! I fear your zeal and <lb/>
strength <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> run in the wrong channel: <lb/>
I fear most of us may take up the Churches <lb/>
complaint, Cant. 1. 6. <quote type="biblical" ana="Song 1.6">They have <lb/>
made me the keeper of the Vineyards, but <lb/>
mine own Vineyard have I not kept.</quote> Two <lb/>
things have eaten up the time and <lb/>
strength of the Professors of this Generation, <lb/>
and sadly diverted them from heart <lb/>
work. (1) Fruitless controversies started <lb/>
by <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised>, I doubt not to this very purpose, <lb/>
to take us off from practical godliness, <lb/>
to make us puzzle our heads, when <lb/>
we should be searching our hearts. O how <lb/>
little have we minded that of the Apostle, <lb/>
Heb. 13. 9. <quote type="biblical" ana="Heb 13.9"><normalised orig="Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> a good thing that the <lb/>
heart be established with Grace, and not with <lb/>
meats</quote>: (i.e.) with disputes and controversies <lb/>
about meats, <quote type="biblical" ana="Heb 13.9">which have not profited <lb/>
them that have been occupied therein.</quote>
                  <lb/>
O how much better is it to see men <lb/>
live exactly, then to hear them dispute <normalised orig="subtilly" auto="true">subtly</normalised>! <lb/>
these unfruitful questions, how <lb/>
have they <normalised orig="rendred" auto="true">rendered</normalised> the Churches? wasted <lb/>
time and spirits, and called Christians off <lb/>
from their main business, from looking <lb/>
to their own vineyard? what think you <lb/>
Sirs? had it not been better if the questions <lb/>
                  <pb n="38"/>
                  <lb/>
ventilated among the people of <lb/>
God of late days, had been such as these? <lb/>
how shall a man discern the special, from <lb/>
the common operations of the Spirit? <lb/>
how may a Soul discern its first <normalised orig="declineings" auto="false">declinings</normalised> <lb/>
from God? how may a backsliding <lb/>
Christian recover his first love? how <lb/>
may the heart be preserved from unseasonable <lb/>
thoughts in duty? how may a <lb/>
<normalised orig="bosome" auto="true">bosom</normalised> sin be discovered and mortified, <lb/>
&amp;c. Would not this have tended <lb/>
more to the credit of religion, and comfort <lb/>
of your Souls? O <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> time to repent, <lb/>
and be ashamed of this folly! when <lb/>
I read what Suarez a Papist said, who <lb/>
wrote many Tomes of disputations, that <lb/>
he prised the time he set apart for the <lb/>
searching and examining of his heart, <lb/>
in reference to God, above all the time <lb/>
that ever he spent in other studies: I am <lb/>
ashamed to find the professors of this age <lb/>
yet insensible of their folly: shall the <lb/>
Conscience of a Suarez feel a relenting <lb/>
pang for strength and time so ill <normalised orig="imployed" auto="true">employed</normalised>? <lb/>
and shall not yours? this is it your <lb/>
Ministers long since warned you of: <lb/>
your spiritual nurses were afraid of the <lb/>
rickets, when they saw your heads only to <lb/>
grow, and your hearts to wither. O <lb/>
when will God beat our swords into <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="188">187</fw>
                  <pb n="39"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="plowshares" auto="true">ploughshares</normalised>! I mean our disputes and <lb/>
contentions, into practical godliness. <lb/>
(2) Another cause of neglecting our <lb/>
heart <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been earthly <normalised orig="incumbrances" auto="true">encumbrances</normalised>: <lb/>
the heads and hearts of many have been <lb/>
filled with such a crowd and noise of <lb/>
worldly business, that they have sadly <lb/>
and sensibly declined and withered in <lb/>
their zeal, love and delight in God, in <lb/>
their heavenly, serious, and profitable <lb/>
way of conversing with man. <lb/>
O how <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> this wilderness <normalised orig="intangled" auto="true">entangled</normalised> <lb/>
us! our discourses and conferences, nay <lb/>
our very prayers and duties have a tang <lb/>
of it: we have had so much work without <lb/>
doors, that we have been able to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> <lb/>
but little within. It was the sad complaint <lb/>
of an holy one, O <lb/>
saith he! <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> sad to think, <lb/>
how many precious opportunities <lb/>
I have lost, how many sweet <lb/>
motions, and admonitions of the Spirit <lb/>
I have posted over unfruitfully, and <lb/>
made the Lord to speak in vain, in the <lb/>
secret <normalised orig="illapses" auto="false">ellipses</normalised> of his Spirit, the Lord <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
called upon me, but my worldly thoughts <lb/>
did still lodge within me, and there was <lb/>
no place in my heart for such calls of <lb/>
God. surely there is a way of <normalised orig="injoying" auto="true">enjoying</normalised> <lb/>
God, even in our worldly <normalised orig="imployments" auto="true">employments</normalised>; <lb/>

                  </choice> would never have put us upon <lb/>
them to our loss. Enoch walked with <lb/>
God, and <normalised orig="begat" auto="true">begot</normalised> sons and daughters, Gen. <lb/>
5. 19. He walked with God, but did <lb/>
not retire and <normalised orig="seperate" auto="true">separate</normalised> himself from the <lb/>
things of this life: and the Angels that <lb/>
are <normalised orig="imployed" auto="true">employed</normalised> by Christ in the things of <lb/>
this world (for the Spirit of the living <lb/>
creatures is in the wheels) they are finite <lb/>
creatures, and cannot be in a twofold <lb/>
ubi at one time, yet they lose nothing <lb/>
of the beatifical vision, all the time of <lb/>
their administration, for Matth. 18. 10. <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 18.10">their angels</quote> (even <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> they are <normalised orig="imployed" auto="true">employed</normalised> <lb/>
for them) <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 18.10">Behold the face of their <lb/>

lose our visions by our <normalised orig="imployments" auto="true">employments</normalised>, if <lb/>
the fault were not our own: alas! that <lb/>
ever Christians who stand at the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised> <lb/>
of eternity, and have more work upon <lb/>
their hands then this poor moment of <lb/>
interposing time is sufficient for, should <lb/>
yet be filling both our heads and hearts <lb/>
with trifles. <lb/>
3. Hence also I infer for the awakening <lb/>
of all, that if the keeping of the heart be the <lb/>
great work of a Christian, then there are but <lb/>
few real Christians in the world. <lb/>
Indeed, if every one that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> learned <lb/>
the dialect of Christianity, and can <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> <lb/>
                  <pb n="41"/>
                  <lb/>
like a Saint, if every one that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> gifts <lb/>
and parts, and by the common assisting <lb/>
presence of the Spirit can preach, pray, <lb/>
or discourse like a Christian: in a word, <lb/>
if such as associate themselves with the <lb/>
people of God, and delight in ordinances, <lb/>
might pass for Christians, the number <lb/>
then is great. <lb/>
But alas! to what a small number will <lb/>
they shrink, if you judge them by this <lb/>
rule! how few are there, that make <lb/>
Conscience of keeping their hearts, <lb/>
watching their thoughts, judging their <lb/>
ends, &amp;c. O there be but few closet men <lb/>
among professors! <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> far easier for men <lb/>
to be reconciled to any duties in religion <lb/>
then to these: the <normalised orig="prophane" auto="true">profane</normalised> part of the <lb/>
world will not so much as touch with <lb/>
the outside of religious duties, much less <lb/>
to this: and for the hypocrit though he <lb/>
be polite and curious about those externals, <lb/>
yet you can never <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> him <lb/>
to this inward work, this difficult work: <lb/>
this work to which there is no inducement <lb/>
by humane applause, this work <lb/>
that would quickly discover what the <lb/>
hypocrit cares not to know, so that by <lb/>
a general consent, this heart work is left <lb/>
to the hands of a few secret ones and I <lb/>
tremble to think in how few hands it is. <lb/>

<normalised orig="accrew" auto="true">accrue</normalised> to you thereby; if so many dear and <lb/>

fall close to this work. <lb/>
O study your hearts, watch your hearts, <lb/>
keep your hearts: away with fruitless controversies <lb/>
and idle questions, away with <lb/>
empty names and vain <normalised orig="shews" auto="true">shows</normalised>, away with <lb/>
unprofitable discourse &amp; bold censures of <lb/>
others, turn in upon your selves, get into <lb/>
your closets, and now resolve to dwell <lb/>
there: you have been strangers to this <lb/>
work too long, you have kept others vineyards <lb/>
too long, you have trifled about <lb/>
the borders of religion too long, this <lb/>
world <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="deteined" auto="true">detained</normalised> you from your <lb/>
great work too long; will you now resolve <lb/>
to look better to your hearts? will <lb/>
you haste and come out of the crowds <lb/>

and retire your selves more then you <lb/>
have done? O that this day you would <lb/>
resolve upon it! <lb/>

                  <lb/>
thee; all that I beg for is but this, that <lb/>
thou <normalised orig="wouldst" auto="true">would</normalised> step aside a little <normalised orig="oftner" auto="true">oftener</normalised> to <lb/>
talk with God, and thine own heart, <lb/>
that thou <normalised orig="wouldst" auto="true">would</normalised> not suffer every trifle <lb/>
to divert thee, that thou <normalised orig="wouldest" auto="true">would</normalised> keep <lb/>
a more true and faithful account of thy <lb/>
thoughts and affections: that thou <lb/>
<normalised orig="wouldst" auto="true">would</normalised> but seriously demand of thine <lb/>
own heart, at least every evening, O my <lb/>
heart where <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> thou been to day? whether <lb/>
<normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> thou made a road to day? if all <lb/>
that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been said by way of inducement <lb/>

this: <lb/>
1. Motive The studying, observing, and <lb/>
diligent keeping of your own hearts will marvellously <lb/>
help your understanding in the deep <lb/>
mysteries of Religion. <lb/>
An honest well experienced heart is a <lb/>
singular help to a weak head, such a heart <lb/>
will serve you in stead of a Commentary <lb/>
upon a great part of the Scriptures: by <lb/>
this means you shall far better understand <lb/>

<normalised orig="Rabbies" auto="true">Rabbis</normalised> and profound Doctors (if graceless <lb/>

profoundly of the nature and effects of <lb/>
faith, the troubles and comforts of Conscience, <lb/>
the sweetness of Communion <lb/>
with God, that never felt the efficacy and <lb/>
sweet impressions of these things upon <lb/>
his own spirit: but O how dark and dry <lb/>
are these notions, compared with his, upon <lb/>
whose heart they have been acted? <lb/>

what I say, experience is the best School-master. <lb/>
O then! study your hearts, <lb/>

2. Mot. The study and observation of <lb/>
your own hearts will antidote you against the <lb/>
dangerous and infecting <normalised orig="errours" auto="true">errors</normalised> of the times <lb/>
and places you live in. <lb/>
For what think you is the reason that <lb/>
so many professors in England have departed <lb/>
from the faith, giving heed to <lb/>
fables: that so many thousands have <lb/>

that Jesuits and Quakers who have <lb/>
sown corrupt doctrine, have had such <lb/>
plentiful harvests among us, but because <lb/>
they have met with a company of empty <lb/>
notional professors that never knew what <lb/>
belongs to practical godliness, and the <lb/>
study of their own hearts. <lb/>
If professors did but give diligence to <lb/>
study, search, and watch their own <lb/>
hearts, they would have that NoValue
                  <lb/>
that <normalised orig="stedfastness" auto="false">steadfastness</normalised> of their own that <lb/>

that by argument. <lb/>
3. Mot. Your care and diligence in <lb/>
keeping your hearts, will prove one of the best <lb/>
evidences of your sincerity. <lb/>
I know no external act of religion that <lb/>

                  <lb/>
differences the sound from the unsound <lb/>

how far hypocrits go in all external duties, <lb/>
how plausibly they can order the <lb/>
outward man, hiding all their indecencies <lb/>
from the observation of the world. <lb/>
But then, they take no heed to their <lb/>
hearts, they are not in secret, what they <lb/>
appear to be in <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised>: and before this <lb/>
<normalised orig="tryal" auto="true">trial</normalised> no hypocrit can stand; <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> <normalised orig="confest" auto="true">confessed</normalised>, <lb/>
they may in a fit, under a pang upon a <lb/>
death-bed, cry out of the wickedness of <lb/>
their hearts; but alas! there is no heed <lb/>
to be taken to these extorted complaints: <lb/>
in our law no credit is to be given to the <lb/>
testimony of one upon the rack, because <lb/>
it may be supposed, that the extremity <lb/>
of the torture may make him say any <lb/>
thing to be eased, but if self <normalised orig="jealousie" auto="true">jealousy</normalised>, <lb/>
care, and watchfulness be the daily <lb/>

thee upon those secret duties, which <normalised orig="lye" auto="true">lie</normalised> <lb/>

4. Mot. How fruitful sweet and comfortable <lb/>
would all Ordinances and Duties be to <lb/>
us if our hearts were better kept? <lb/>
O what precious communion might <lb/>
you have with God, every time you approach <lb/>
him; if your hearts were but in <lb/>
frame! you might then say with David, <lb/>
<normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 104. 34. <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 104.34">My meditation of him shall <lb/>
be sweet</quote>. That which loses all our comforts <lb/>
in ordinances and more secret duties, <lb/>
is the indisposedness of the heart: a <lb/>
Christian whose heart is in a good frame <lb/>
gets the start of all others that come with <lb/>
him in that duty: they tugging hard <lb/>
to get up their hearts to God, now trying <lb/>
this argument upon them and then <lb/>
that, to quicken and affect them, and <lb/>
sometimes <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> away as <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> as they <lb/>
came. Sometimes the duty is almost <lb/>
ended before their hearts begin to <normalised orig="stirr" auto="true">stir</normalised> <lb/>
to feel any warmth, <normalised orig="quickning" auto="true">quickening</normalised>, or power <lb/>
from it: but all this while the prepared <lb/>
heart is at its work; this is he that <lb/>
ordinarily gets the first sight of Christ <lb/>
in a Sermon: the first seal from Christ in <lb/>
a Sacrament: the first kiss from Christ <lb/>
in secret prayer. I tell you, and I tell <lb/>
                  <pb n="48"/>
                  <lb/>
you but what I have felt, that Prayers <lb/>
and Sermons would appear to you other <lb/>
manner of things then they <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>, did you <lb/>
but bring better ordered hearts unto <lb/>
them, you would not <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> away dejected <lb/>
and drooping, O this <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been a lost <lb/>
day, a lost duty to me, if you had not <lb/>
lost your hearts it might not be so: if then <lb/>
the comfort of ordinances be sweet, look <lb/>
to your hearts, keep your hearts. <lb/>
5. Mot. Acquaintance with your own <lb/>
hearts would be a Fountain of matter to you in <lb/>
Prayer. <lb/>
A man that is diligent in heart work, <lb/>
and knows the state of his own Soul; <lb/>
will have a fountain <normalised orig="fulness" auto="true">fullness</normalised> of matter <lb/>
to supply him richly in all his addresses <lb/>
to God: his tongue shall not <normalised orig="faulter" auto="true">falter</normalised>, and <lb/>
make pauses for want of matter, <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. <lb/>
45. 1. <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 45.1">my heart is enditing a good matter</quote>: <lb/>
or as Montanus renders the original, my <lb/>
heart is <normalised orig="boyling" auto="true">boiling</normalised> up good matter, like a <lb/>
living spring that is still <normalised orig="bubling" auto="true">bubbling</normalised> up fresh <lb/>
water; and then my tongue is as the <lb/>
pen of a ready writer: others must pump <lb/>
their memories, rack their inventions, <lb/>
and are often at a loss when they have <lb/>
done all: but if thou have kept and faithfully <lb/>
studied thine own heart, twill be <lb/>

                  <fw type="pageNum" n="198">O 3</fw>
                  <pb n="49"/>
                  <lb/>
with thee (as Job speaks in another case) <lb/>
like bottles full of new wine that want <lb/>
vent, which are ready to burst: as holy <lb/>
matter flows plentifully, so more feelingly <lb/>
and sweetly from such a heart: <lb/>
when a heart experienced Christian is <lb/>
mourning before God over some special <lb/>
heart corruption, <normalised orig="wrastling" auto="true">wrestling</normalised> with God <lb/>
for the supply of some special inward <lb/>
want, he speaks not as other men <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>, <lb/>
that have learned to pray by rote, their <lb/>
confessions and petitions are squeezed <lb/>
out, his drop freely like pure honey from <lb/>
the <normalised orig="combe" auto="true">comb</normalised>, <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> a happiness then to be <lb/>
with or <normalised orig="neer" auto="true">near</normalised> such a Christian. I remember <lb/>
Bernard having given rules to prepare <lb/>
the heart for prayer concludes them thus, <lb/>
                  Et cum talis fueris memento mei: and <lb/>
(saith he) when thy heart is in this frame <lb/>
then remember me. <lb/>
6. Mot. By this the decayed power of <lb/>
religion will be recovered again among professors, <lb/>
which is the most desirable sight in <lb/>
this world. <lb/>
O that I might live to see that day! <lb/>
when professors shall not walk in a vain <lb/>
<normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised>, when they shall please themselves <lb/>
no more with a name to live, being spiritually <lb/>
dead: when they shall be no <lb/>

                  <lb/>
more (as many of them now are) a company <lb/>
of frothy, vain, and unserious <lb/>
persons, but the <normalised orig="majestick" auto="true">majestic</normalised> beams of holiness <lb/>
shining from their heavenly, and <lb/>
serious conversations shall awe the world, <lb/>
and command reverence from all that <lb/>
are about them: when they shall warm <lb/>
the hearts of those that come nigh them, <lb/>
so that men shall say, God is in these <lb/>
men of a truth. <lb/>
Well, such a time may again be <normalised orig="exspected" auto="false">expected</normalised> <lb/>
according to that promise, Isai. <lb/>
60. 21. The people <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 60.21">shall be all righteous</quote>
                  <lb/>
But till we fall closer this great work <lb/>
of keeping our hearts, I am out of hopes <lb/>
to see those blessed <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised>: I cannot <normalised orig="exspect" auto="true">expect</normalised> <lb/>
better times, till God give better <lb/>

what a scorn religion is made in the <lb/>
world, what objects of contempt and <lb/>
scorn the professors of it are made in the <lb/>
world. <lb/>
Professors, would you recover your <lb/>
credit? would you again obtain an honourable <lb/>
testimony in the Consciences <lb/>
of your very enemies? then, keep your <lb/>
hearts, watch your hearts: <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> the <normalised orig="loosness" auto="true">looseness</normalised> <lb/>

Yea, how are the Consciences of fallen <lb/>
professors plunged and even overwhelmed <lb/>
in the deeps of trouble? God <lb/>
inwardly excommunicating their Souls <lb/>
from all comfortable fellowship with <lb/>
himself, and the joys of his salvation: <lb/>
infinite are the mischiefs that come by the <lb/>
scandalous lives of professors. <lb/>
And what is the true cause and reason <lb/>
of all this; but the neglecting of their <lb/>
hearts? were our hearts better kept, all <lb/>
this would be prevented: had David <lb/>
kept his heart, he had not broken his <lb/>
bones: a neglected careless heart, must <lb/>
of necessity produce a disorderly scandalous <lb/>
life. I <normalised orig="thanke" auto="true">thank</normalised> God for the <lb/>
<normalised orig="freedome" auto="true">freedom</normalised> and faithfulness of a <lb/>

searched by that probe, God would be <lb/>

O professors! if ever you will keep religion <lb/>
sweet, if ever you hope to recover <lb/>
the credit of it in the world, keep <lb/>
your hearts: either keep your hearts, or <lb/>

8. Mot. An heart well kept will fit you <lb/>
for any condition God casts you into, or any <lb/>
service he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> to use you in. <lb/>
He that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> learnt how to keep his <lb/>
heart lowly, is fit for prosperity: and he <lb/>
that knows how to use and apply to it <lb/>
Scripture promises, and supports, is fit <lb/>
to pass through any adversity: he that <lb/>
can deny the pride and selfishness of his <lb/>
heart is fit to be <normalised orig="imployed" auto="true">employed</normalised> in any service <lb/>
for God: such a man was Paul, he did <lb/>
not only spend his time in preaching to <lb/>
others, in keeping others vineyards, but <lb/>
he <normalised orig="lookt" auto="true">looked</normalised> to himself, kept his own vineyard, <lb/>
1 Cor 9. 27. Least <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 9.27">when I have preached <lb/>
to others, I my self should be a cast away</quote>: <lb/>
and what an eminent instrument was he <lb/>
for God, he could turn his hand to any <lb/>
work, he could dexterously manage <lb/>
both in adverse and prosperous condition: <lb/>
I know how to abound, and how <lb/>
to suffer want; let the people <normalised orig="deifie" auto="true">deify</normalised> him, <lb/>
it moves him not, unless to indignation: <lb/>
                  <pb n="54"/>
                  <lb/>
Let them stone him, he can bear it: <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Tim 2.21">if <lb/>
a man purge himself from these</quote> (saith he <lb/>
2 Tim. 2. 21.) <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Tim 2.21">He shall be a Vessel unto <lb/>
honour, sanctified and meet for the masters <lb/>
use, and prepared unto every good work.</quote>
                  <lb/>
First the heart must be purged; and <lb/>
then <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> prepared for any service of God: <lb/>
when the heart of Isaiah was purified, <lb/>
which was the thing signified by the <lb/>
touching of his lips with a coal from the <lb/>
Altar, Isai. 6. 7. then he was fit for Gods <lb/>
work: <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 6.8">here am I, send me</quote>, v. 8. a man <lb/>
that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not learned to keep his heart, <lb/>
put him upon any service for God, and <lb/>
if it be attended with honour, it shall <lb/>
swell up and overtop his spirit: if with <lb/>
suffering it will exanimate and sink <lb/>
him. <lb/>
Jesus Christ had an instrumental fitness <lb/>
for his fathers work above all the <lb/>
servants that ever God <normalised orig="imployed" auto="true">employed</normalised>, he <lb/>
was zealous in <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> work for God, so <lb/>
zealous, that sometimes <normalised orig="forgat" auto="true">forgot</normalised> to eat <lb/>
bread, yea, that his friends thought he <lb/>
had been besides himself: but yet he so <lb/>
carried on his <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> work, as not to <lb/>
forget his own private communion with <lb/>
God; and therefore you read in Matth. <lb/>
14. 23. that when he had been labouring <lb/>
                  <pb n="55"/>
                  <lb/>
all day yet after that, he went up to a <lb/>
mountain apart to pray, and was there <lb/>
alone. O let the keepers of the vineyards <lb/>
look to their own vineyard! we <lb/>
shall never be so instrumental to the <lb/>
good of others, as when we are most <lb/>
diligent about our own Souls. <lb/>
9. Mot. If the people of God would more <lb/>
diligently keep their hearts, how exceedingly <lb/>
would the communion of Saints be thereby <lb/>
<normalised orig="sweetned" auto="true">sweetened</normalised>. <lb/>
How goodly then would be thy tents <lb/>
O Jacob, and thy tabernacles O Israel! <lb/>
then as <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> prophesied of the Jews, Zech. <lb/>
8. 23. Men would say, <quote type="biblical" ana="Zech 8.23">we will go with you, <lb/>

                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> the fellowship your Souls have with <lb/>
the Father and with the Son, that draws <lb/>

with you. 1 Joh. 1. 3. I tell you if Saints <lb/>
would be <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> to take more pains, <lb/>

<normalised orig="Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> the pride, passion, and earthliness <lb/>

                  <lb/>
fellowship: whence is it? that when <lb/>
Christians meet, they are often jarring <lb/>
and contending, but only for their unmortified <lb/>
passions: whence are their uncharitable <lb/>
censures of their brethren, but <lb/>
only from self ignorance? why are they <lb/>
so rigid, and unmerciful towards those <lb/>
that are fallen? but because they consider <lb/>
not themselves, as the Apostle speaks <lb/>
Gal. 6. 1. why is their discourse so frothy <lb/>
and unprofitable when they meet? <lb/>
is not this from the earthliness and vanity <lb/>
of their hearts? <lb/>
My brethren, these be the things that <lb/>
have spoiled Christian fellowship, and <lb/>
made it become a dry and sapless thing; <lb/>
so that many Christians are even weary <lb/>
of it, and are ready to say with the prophet <lb/>
Jer. 9. 2. <quote type="biblical" ana="Jer 9.2">O that I had a Cottage in <lb/>

to them that are their own people, <lb/>
as the original of that text imports, <lb/>
2 Cor. 5. 8. <lb/>
But now, if professors would study <lb/>

                  <lb/>
their own hearts more, watch and keep <lb/>
them better, all this would be prevented; <lb/>
and the beauty and glory of communion <lb/>
again restored: they would divide no <lb/>
more, contend no more, censure rashly <lb/>
no more; when their hearts are in tune <lb/>
their tongues will not <normalised orig="jarre" auto="true">jar</normalised>, how charitable, <lb/>
pitiful and tender will they be one <lb/>
of <normalised orig="onother" auto="false">another</normalised>, when every one is daily <lb/>
humbled under the evil of his own heart; <lb/>
Lord hasten those much desired <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised>, <lb/>
and bless these counsels in order to <lb/>
them. <lb/>
10. Mot. Lastly, By this the comforts <lb/>
of the Spirit, and precious influences of all <lb/>
Ordinances would be fixed, and much longer <lb/>
preserved in your Souls than now they are. <lb/>
Ah! what would I give, that my Soul <lb/>
might be preserved in that frame I sometimes <lb/>
find it after an Ordinance! aliquando <lb/>
intromittis me domine in affectum <lb/>
multum <choice ana="illegible">
                        <sic>inusi*atum</sic>
                        <corr>inusitatum</corr>
                     </choice>, introrsus ad nescio quam <lb/>
dulcedinem, &amp;c. Sometimes O Lord, <lb/>
(saith one of the fathers sweetly) thou <lb/>
<normalised orig="admittest" auto="false">admitted</normalised> me into the most inward, unusual <lb/>
and sweet delights, to I know not <lb/>
what sweetness, which were it perfected <lb/>
in me, I know not what it would be; <lb/>
or rather, what it would not be. But <lb/>
                  <pb n="58"/>
                  <lb/>
alas! the heart grows careless again, <lb/>
and quickly returns, like water removed <lb/>
from the fire to its native coldness: <lb/>
could you but keep those things for ever <lb/>
in your hearts, what Christians would <lb/>
you be! what lives would you live! and <lb/>
how is it that these things remain no <lb/>
longer with us? doubtless it is because <lb/>
we suffer our hearts to take cold again: <lb/>
we should be as careful after an ordinance <lb/>
or duty to prevent this, as one that <lb/>
comes out of an hot bath, or great sweat <lb/>
is; of going out into the chill air: we <lb/>
have our hot and cold fits by turns, and <lb/>
what is the reason but our unskilfulness <lb/>
and <normalised orig="carelesness" auto="true">carelessness</normalised> in keeping the heart. <lb/>
<normalised orig="Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> a thousand pities, that the ordinances <lb/>
of God, as to their <normalised orig="quickning" auto="true">quickening</normalised> <lb/>
and comforting effects, should be like <lb/>
those humane ordinances the Apostle <lb/>
speaks of, that perish in the using. O <lb/>
then, let me say to you, as Job. 15. 11. <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Job 15.11"><normalised orig="Doe" auto="true">Do</normalised> the consolations of God seem small to <lb/>
you?</quote> Look over these ten special benefits, <lb/>
weigh them in a just <normalised orig="ballance" auto="true">balance</normalised>; are they <lb/>
small matters? is it a small matter to <lb/>
have thy weak understanding assisted? <lb/>
thine endangered Soul antidoted, thy <lb/>

                  <lb/>
God <normalised orig="sweetned" auto="true">sweetened</normalised>, thy sails filled in prayer, <lb/>
is it a small thing to have the decayed <lb/>
power of godliness again recovered, all <lb/>
fatal scandals removed, an instrumental <lb/>
fitness to serve Christ obtained, <lb/>
the Communion of Saints restored to its <lb/>
primitive glory, and the influences of <lb/>
ordinances abiding in the Souls of Saints, <lb/>
if these be no common blessings, no <lb/>
small benefits, then surely <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> a great <lb/>
duty to keep the heart with all diligence. <lb/>
