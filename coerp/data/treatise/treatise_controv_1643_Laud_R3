KING CHARLES was within few<lb/>

Kingdoms; and for a while, as<lb/>
his Subjects seemed to enjoy all the<lb/>
blandishments of peace under his<lb/>
<normalised orig="reigne" auto="true">reign</normalised>, to the <normalised orig="envie" auto="true">envy</normalised> of other Nations;<lb/>
so he <normalised orig="appear'd" auto="true">appeared</normalised> eminently glorious in<lb/>
the inviolable loyalty and obedience<lb/>
of his Subjects; to the inciting of envy<lb/>
amongst other Princes.<lb/>
But to that serene, <normalised orig="delightfull" auto="true">delightful</normalised> <normalised orig="calme" auto="true">calm</normalised>,<lb/>
a most <normalised orig="dismall" auto="true">dismal</normalised> tempest <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> since <normalised orig="suceeded" auto="true">succeeded</normalised>;<lb/>
and in so short a traverse of time a more <normalised orig="wofull" auto="true">woeful</normalised>, desperate<lb/>
Catastrophe (then this which now confounds both King and Subjects)<lb/>
was scarce ever brought about in any other <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised>. All our<lb/>
gamesome <normalised orig="Holidayes" auto="true">Holidays</normalised> past, seem now to us like the sleep of Jonah in<lb/>
the ship, the trance thereof <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <normalised orig="lockt" auto="true">locked</normalised> up our senses for a while, that<lb/>
we might be betrayed to the greater horror and amazement, when<lb/>
the incursion of unexpected calamities should immediately seize us<lb/>
under so dead and stupid a condition. Ireland already is become as<lb/>
sad a spectacle as the <normalised orig="ruthlesse" auto="true">ruthless</normalised> hand of war ever made any since Vespasians<lb/>
<normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>: and England, though it sinks a little more slowly, yet<lb/>
is in the posture of sinking, and is not to be supported but by a divine<lb/>
hand more then <normalised orig="ordinarie" auto="true">ordinary</normalised>: and lastly, Scotland is but one degree only<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="2">A3</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
more removed from destruction. The greater the Popish faction is in<lb/>
Scotland, and the more potent that Court-party there is, which suggests<lb/>
to it self probable advantages out of the <normalised orig="shipwrack" auto="true">shipwreck</normalised> of broken<lb/>
England, the more inevitably is that Nation owned and <normalised orig="destin'd" auto="true">destined</normalised> to<lb/>
the same <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised> as England; let not dreams infatuate, she must expect<lb/>
the same line to be stretched over her, as England has, if she prevent<lb/>
not her fate by some sisterly assistance, <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> it is thus distant, she<lb/>
shall certainly unpitied perish at its <normalised orig="neerer" auto="true">nearer</normalised> approach.<lb/>
But the Question is, Whence did these <normalised orig="unnaturall" auto="true">unnatural</normalised> <normalised orig="broyls" auto="true">broils</normalised> spring<lb/>
and arise; <normalised orig="Hath" auto="true">Has</normalised> the Kings misgovernment, or the Nations rebellious<lb/>
disposition, caused these sudden distempers? has all this discord been<lb/>
<normalised orig="stirr'd" auto="true">stirred</normalised> principally by <normalised orig="Ecclesiasticall" auto="true">Ecclesiastical</normalised> or <normalised orig="Civill" auto="true">Civil</normalised> Persons? and have their<lb/>
ends been <normalised orig="temporall" auto="true">temporal</normalised> or <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised>? How does that commotion which<lb/>
was in Scotland differ in cause from ours in England; or this in England<lb/>
from that in Ireland? Has it been the same <normalised orig="designe" auto="true">design</normalised> carried on for<lb/>
many <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised> together, from whose maturity at length all our troubles<lb/>
in all the three Nations have been derived? Or have the Scots occasionally<lb/>
aimed at one thing, the Irish at another, and the English at another?<lb/>
If the Rebels in Ireland, and the Parliament in England have<lb/>
purposes diametrically opposite, how is it that the King protests<lb/>
against both? how comes it, that he wages a war upon the Parliament,<lb/>
that is as favourable to the Irish, as destructive to the English?<lb/>
And if the Scots and the English propose the same thing, how is it that<lb/>
the English are thus implacably Prosecuted, <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> the Scots are<lb/>
friendly <normalised orig="intreated" auto="true">entreated</normalised>? How is it, that Papists are so far united, yea, even<lb/>
in Ireland where they pretend for the King, contrary to the acknowledgement<lb/>
of our Court, yet all of them move <normalised orig="undevided" auto="false">undivided</normalised>, and in England,<lb/>
where they fight for the King, and are accordingly entertained<lb/>
and allowed so to do; yet still they are unanimous, whereas Protestants<lb/>
hold no perfect correspondence any where, in Ireland they <normalised orig="joyn" auto="true">join</normalised><lb/>
against Papists, yet favour the Papists cause in England; and in England<lb/>
they fight under Popish Banners, and by consequence <normalised orig="maintaine" auto="true">maintain</normalised><lb/>
the <normalised orig="Romish" auto="true">Roman</normalised> faith, both in England and Ireland? And if these miseries<lb/>
have been not <normalised orig="meere" auto="true">mere</normalised> late <normalised orig="accidentall" auto="true">accidental</normalised> events, but the studied and prepared<lb/>
accomplishments and productions of divers former <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised>, then<lb/>
whether <normalised orig="is't" auto="true">is it</normalised> more probable, that the Parliament, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been this<lb/>
long time <normalised orig="busie" auto="true">busy</normalised> in plotting against the Court, or the Court against<lb/>
the Parliament?<lb/>
To give satisfaction to all men in all these Queeries, will be difficult;<lb/>
but to give satisfaction to all honest Protestants, and to convince<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="3">2</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
all our most <normalised orig="subtill" auto="true">subtle</normalised> enemies, be they Protestants or Papists, will<lb/>
not be impossible; and therefore my utmost skill shall endeavour it.<lb/>
And if this age will not give me credit therein, I am certain the next<lb/>
will; I will commandingly say, That it shall without dissent and <normalised orig="deniall" auto="true">denial</normalised><lb/>
receive and acknowledge these truths which I now deliver.<lb/>
The sons of the Jews erected <normalised orig="Trophyes" auto="true">Trophies</normalised>, and built Monuments of<lb/>
honour for those Prophets which had been stoned in the ages before,<lb/>
and yet at the same time, perhaps they maliciously murdered the<lb/>
true <normalised orig="successours" auto="true">successors</normalised> of the same Prophets; such difference is there betwixt<lb/>
the evidence of present and past truth; nevertheless, I shall for<lb/>
the present lie the <normalised orig="leste" auto="true">lest</normalised> obnoxious to contradiction or distrust, because<lb/>
I shall not so much insist upon conjectures or nude averments of my<lb/>
own, as the censures of strangers and Papists; and the judgements of<lb/>
other Statesmen, whose partiality herein is the <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> to be suspected.<lb/>
The great <normalised orig="tyranie" auto="true">tyranny</normalised> and usurpation of <normalised orig="Romane" auto="true">Roman</normalised> Prelates, who (to purchase<lb/>
to themselves an <normalised orig="Ecclesiasticall" auto="true">Ecclesiastical</normalised> Empire, more large and <normalised orig="uncontrolable" auto="true">uncontrollable</normalised><lb/>
then any <normalised orig="temporall" auto="true">temporal</normalised> Monarch ever challenged) had perverted<lb/>
Religion and innovated the whole frame of Christianity; began<lb/>
to be discovered to many in England about 120 <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised> since: Henry the<lb/>
eighth also, so far as his own Crown was concerned therein, was<lb/>
wiling to countenance the discovery; but as for a <normalised orig="totall" auto="true">total</normalised> reformation<lb/>
of Religion, or redemption of his Subjects liberty from popish<lb/>
<normalised orig="thraldome" auto="true">thraldom</normalised>, no such thought ever <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> into his breast. <normalised orig="'Twas" auto="true">It was</normalised> indifferent<lb/>
to him on the same day, and in the same place, to hang a<lb/>
Papist maintaining the Popes supremacy, and to burn a Protestant<lb/>
denying those corruptions of Religion whereupon that supremacy<lb/>
was founded: so indigested and rude a Chaos of Doctrine was that<lb/>
which he sought to authorise and to daub over with his untempered<lb/>
<normalised orig="morter" auto="true">mortar</normalised>. Edward the sixth, by a more blessed illumination, set himself<lb/>
to pull down the whole <normalised orig="fabrick" auto="true">fabric</normalised>, and to raze the very foundation<lb/>
of Hierarchy; and had it not been a work of more <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised>, then it<lb/>
pleased God to <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised> to his life, he surely had not left one stone upon<lb/>
another. Queen Mary set her self as entirely to repair the Popes Empire,<lb/>
as her brother did to <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised> it; yea, even to the effusion of much<lb/>
blood, with a more fierce zeal she laboured in it, and had not death<lb/>
overtaken her, and the hand of God otherwise crossed her, perhaps<lb/>
no hopes had been left for a new <normalised orig="restauration" auto="true">restoration</normalised> under her successor.<lb/>
Queen Elizabeth, with as perfect an integrity as either her brothers<lb/>
was in maintenance of truth, of her sisters in maintenance of superstition,<lb/>
<normalised orig="applyed" auto="true">applied</normalised> her self and her utmost power to restore Religion<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="4">3</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
again in full conformity to her brother, and opposition to her sister.<lb/>
Two admirable <normalised orig="Councellors" auto="true">Counsellors</normalised> she had, Cecyll and Bacon, both <normalised orig="cordiall" auto="true">cordial</normalised><lb/>
and totally addicted to the Protestant Religion: the honour of<lb/>
whom leaves her honour unquestionable; for as much as to choose<lb/>
good instruments is the noblest testimony of <normalised orig="goodnesse" auto="true">goodness</normalised>: and the influence<lb/>
of Princes upon servants, is greater then that of servants upon<lb/>
Princes. I have heard that the then Earl of <normalised orig="Pembrooke" auto="true">Pembroke</normalised> being <normalised orig="sollicited" auto="true">solicited</normalised><lb/>
by other Court Grandees, to enter into a <normalised orig="confederacie" auto="true">confederacy</normalised> with<lb/>
them about some alteration in Church and State, he told them<lb/>
plainly, he durst not venture his manner of Wilton in the <normalised orig="businesse" auto="true">business</normalised>,<lb/>
<normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> Cecyll and Bacon were first hanged at the Court gate; and to<lb/>
hang them would be a matter not to be compassed, till they with<lb/>
their <normalised orig="Rhetorick" auto="true">Rhetoric</normalised> in Cheapside should avert the Citizens hearts from<lb/>
them, and that he left as a fond conceit. <normalised orig="Neverthelesse" auto="true">Nevertheless</normalised>, in censure of<lb/>
Queen Elizabeth, some have said that she swept the <normalised orig="roome" auto="true">room</normalised> clean, but<lb/>
yet left all the dust heaped up behind the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>, and did not carry it<lb/>
forth as she ought to have done. Their meaning, I conceive, is, that<lb/>
though she much awed and restrained both Prelates and Papists, so<lb/>
as they durst not attempt any thing against the constitution of this<lb/>
State, during her <normalised orig="reigne" auto="true">reign</normalised>; yet she left them not in so desperate a condition,<lb/>
but that they did recover strength, and reunite again after<lb/>
her death. This censure seems to me too harsh: for Prelates without<lb/>
the copulation of Papists to gender a filthy <normalised orig="spawne" auto="true">spawn</normalised> upon them, are<lb/>
not of any considerable danger; and Papists by her long and prosperous<lb/>
reign, were as much quelled and disabled, as possible they could<lb/>
be. If any dust was left behind the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised>, <normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> because her life-time<lb/>
was not extensive enough for the carrying it forth; for the reduction<lb/>
of Ireland was very late, she scarce survived it, and yet to make the<lb/>
Irish Protestants, was of <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> more <normalised orig="difficultie" auto="true">difficulty</normalised>, and would consume<lb/>
longer time then to make them Subjects.<lb/>
The propagation of the true Faith therefore in Ireland, was a task<lb/>
which Queen Elizabeth was of necessity to leave to her successors; and<lb/>
<normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> very probable, had they begun where she desisted, and not deviated<lb/>
from her resolution, that Kingdom had long ere this, afforded as<lb/>
many Protestants as Subjects; whereas now it denies both: for <normalised orig="doubtlesse" auto="true">doubtless</normalised><lb/>
Queen Elizabeth at her decease, left Ireland in better disposition<lb/>
to conform to England, then she found England in at her sisters decease<lb/>
to revolt from Rome, and therefore with the same industry her<lb/>
successors might have done the same in Ireland as she had done in<lb/>
England. But alas, no such course was taken there; we have reason to<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="5">4</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
think rather that Popery was cherished and preserved in Ireland, to<lb/>
make way for these <normalised orig="tragicall" auto="true">tragical</normalised> divisions, then that there was any <normalised orig="designe" auto="true">design</normalised><lb/>
or undertaking to plant Protestantisme in it, for the establishing<lb/>
further union between the Nations: The example of Q. Elizabeth, to<lb/>
whom the protection of God was as constant in saving her from the<lb/>
bloody Emissaries of Rome, did not work so strongly to animate King<lb/>
James: as the <normalised orig="Apostasie" auto="true">Apostasy</normalised> of Henry the French King, whom God deserted<lb/>
for his desertion, did serve to intimidate him. The revolt of Henry the<lb/>
fourth, who gained the Title of Great by his warlike <normalised orig="atchievements" auto="true">achievements</normalised>,<lb/>
and the horrible conjuration of the Powder <normalised orig="Traytors" auto="true">Traitors</normalised> here in England<lb/>
made so strong impression upon the soft and mild temper of King<lb/>
James; that to temporise a little with Rome, for better security of his<lb/>
Person, appeared at that time very seasonable; wherefore to dally<lb/>
with Antichrist a little, letters were written to <normalised orig="Cardinall" auto="true">Cardinal</normalised> Perrone, and<lb/>
answers received about a reconciliation of Religions, and in order<lb/>
thereunto, the rigour of <normalised orig="penall" auto="true">penal</normalised> Laws was rebated; nay, countenance<lb/>
was <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> to Papists, the <normalised orig="grandour" auto="true">grandeur</normalised> of Prelates and pomp of Ceremonies<lb/>
in the Church began to be affected. The <normalised orig="neerer" auto="true">nearer</normalised> also that King<lb/>
James his end approached, the more it resembled Solomons, and grew<lb/>
tainted with the <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> <normalised orig="symptomes" auto="true">symptoms</normalised> of a declination; in so much that<lb/>
scarce any but Papists were admitted to govern his <normalised orig="Councels" auto="true">Counsels</normalised>, and<lb/>
then the whole Kingdom began to be exposed as a prey, to Spanish,<lb/>
French, Italian pensioners. It was well observed by the Duke of Roan<lb/>
that no Prince in Europe so much opposed his own interests, both in<lb/>
<normalised orig="civill" auto="true">civil</normalised> and religious affairs as King James; for, <normalised orig="doubtlesse" auto="true">doubtless</normalised> the Pope by<lb/>
his agents in all Church matters, was more potent then the King<lb/>
himself; and so was Gundamore in matters of State, had not the<lb/>
French and Dutch, and some other Nations interfered with the Pope<lb/>
and Spaniard, and given gold for some part in us rather to save us,<lb/>
then that we should be lost to their enemies; <normalised orig="doubtlesse" auto="true">doubtless</normalised> we had been<lb/>
disposed of quickly; our <normalised orig="happinesse" auto="true">happiness</normalised> was, that France was <normalised orig="liberall" auto="true">liberal</normalised><lb/>
enough to buy us from Spain, and Spain <normalised orig="liberall" auto="true">liberal</normalised> enough to buy us<lb/>
from France, &amp;c. though our misery was, that both sides pulled away<lb/>
more from us, then they parted <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised> from themselves. And now<lb/>
when three Kingdoms are under the subjection of one Prince, who is<lb/>
under the subjection of one <normalised orig="lustfull" auto="true">lustful</normalised>, rash, young Favourite, and that<lb/>
Favourite solely at the devotion of his <normalised orig="vitious" auto="true">vicious</normalised>, opprobrious, mischievous<lb/>
mother, and that mother a <normalised orig="meere" auto="true">mere</normalised> <normalised orig="Votaresse" auto="true">Votaress</normalised> to Rome, utterly<lb/>
forfeited, resigned, and sold to the commands of <normalised orig="Jesuites" auto="true">Jesuits</normalised>: When our<lb/>
miserable Nations are in this ridiculous, preposterous posture of<lb/>
                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>
government, who can wonder that a Spanish or French Match for<lb/>
our Prince should be designed? As great a <normalised orig="masse" auto="true">mass</normalised> of treasure might<lb/>
have been received with a German Lady, and that with <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> <normalised orig="expence" auto="true">expense</normalised><lb/>
(for the portion of <normalised orig="Spaine" auto="true">Spain</normalised> or France can <normalised orig="scarse" auto="true">scarce</normalised> <normalised orig="equall" auto="true">equal</normalised> the charge of<lb/>
fetching it) all that can be said is, Pistols and Patachoons are more<lb/>
valuable than Dollars, in our judgement. Alliance also amongst<lb/>
Princes, if it be of any, it is of dangerous consequence, it is certain to<lb/>
produce <normalised orig="reall" auto="true">real</normalised> <normalised orig="enmitie" auto="true">enmity</normalised> and emulation: but it is uncertain to produce<lb/>
so much as a shadow of <normalised orig="amitie" auto="true">amity</normalised> and union, especially amongst Princes<lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Romish" auto="true">Roman</normalised> Religion. If we negotiate concerning a marriage with<lb/>
the Spanish Infanta, <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> <normalised orig="necessarie" auto="true">necessary</normalised> that we keep fair intelligence with<lb/>
France, and capitulate strongly with the German Princes: and if we<lb/>
break off with <normalised orig="Spaine" auto="true">Spain</normalised>, and treat with the French Lady, <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> necessary<lb/>
that we enter into a new <normalised orig="confederacie" auto="true">confederacy</normalised> with <normalised orig="Spaine" auto="true">Spain</normalised>, and prepare a<lb/>
Fleet for the Isle of Rhees. So much weaker than cobwebs are the<lb/>
bonds of matrimony amongst ambitious Monarchs.<lb/>
Something also may be said against the incestuous extractions of<lb/>
the House of Austria, and the Florentine mixtures of the House of<lb/>
Burbon; whereas the <normalised orig="nobilitie" auto="true">nobility</normalised>, <normalised orig="chastitie" auto="true">chastity</normalised>, and <normalised orig="beautie" auto="true">beauty</normalised> of the Germane<lb/>

Popish Alliance by those <normalised orig="devillish" auto="true">devilish</normalised> Engineers, which were the insolent<lb/>
Lords of our Lords, or rather of our Lords, Lords, Lords.<lb/>
And if we desire further satisfaction therein, let us consider the<lb/>

MOst noble Prince: the former Kings of Britain have been very famous<lb/>

Father, and the resentment of your <normalised orig="royall" auto="true">royal</normalised> nature (or inclination) delights us,<lb/>

your <normalised orig="designe" auto="true">design</normalised>, which <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> directed you to take a journey into <normalised orig="Spaine" auto="true">Spain</normalised>, to <normalised orig="allye" auto="true">ally</normalised> your<lb/>

                  <lb/>

a daughter of <normalised orig="Spaine" auto="true">Spain</normalised>, we easily conjecture that your <normalised orig="Progenitours" auto="true">Progenitors</normalised> zeal may again<lb/>
revive on your soul; and its not credible, that he that loves such alliance should<lb/>
hate the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Religion, or take delight in oppressing the holy Seat. Therefore<lb/>
<normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> intercession is made continually by our command, that you may be put<lb/>
into possession of that most noble heritage, which your <normalised orig="Ancestours" auto="true">Ancestors</normalised> have purchased<lb/>
for you, to defend the <normalised orig="authoritie" auto="true">authority</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Soveraigne" auto="true">Sovereign</normalised> Bishop, and to combat against<lb/>
the monsters of <normalised orig="heresie" auto="true">heresy</normalised>. The most sacred Kings of England came formerly from<lb/>
England to Rome accompanied with Angels, to honour and do homage to the<lb/>
Prince of the Apostles in his <normalised orig="Chaire" auto="true">Chair</normalised> <normalised orig="Apostolicall" auto="true">Apostolical</normalised>: let their actions be as so many<lb/>
voices of God, to exhort you to the same, and to bring you back again into the lap<lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Romane" auto="true">Roman</normalised> Church. Their sighs and <normalised orig="groanes" auto="true">groans</normalised> are uncessant for your salvation,<lb/>
and you cannot give greater consolation to <normalised orig="Christendome" auto="true">Christendom</normalised>, than to put the<lb/>
Prince of the Apostles into possession of your most noble Isle, holding his <normalised orig="authoritie" auto="true">authority</normalised><lb/>
as the defence of the Kingdoms, and as a Divine Oracle. Our great <normalised orig="charitie" auto="true">charity</normalised><lb/>

I have read the <normalised orig="Elogies" auto="true">Elegies</normalised> of my <normalised orig="Royall" auto="true">Royal</normalised> <normalised orig="Progenitours" auto="true">Progenitors</normalised>, who have exposed<lb/>

eyes by your <normalised orig="Holinesse" auto="true">Holiness</normalised> for imitation) with pleasure unexpressible, and as justly<lb/>
deserved by them. Neither was their courage against the enemies of the <normalised orig="Crosse" auto="true">Cross</normalised><lb/>

to any thing in the world, as to seek alliance with a Prince that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> the same<lb/>
sense of true Religion with my self. I have been <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> very far from encouraging<lb/>
novelties, or being a <normalised orig="partie" auto="true">party</normalised> in any faction against the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>, <normalised orig="Apostolicke" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised>,<lb/>

                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="Romane" auto="true">Roman</normalised> Religion: but have sought all occasions to remove such <normalised orig="suspitions" auto="true">suspicions</normalised><lb/>
from resting on me. And for the future, since we all <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> in one Jesus Christ,<lb/>
I will <normalised orig="straine" auto="true">strain</normalised> all my power to have but one Religion and one Faith; and I am resolved<lb/>
to spare nothing in the world, but to suffer all manner of discommodities,<lb/>
even to the hazard of life and estate, for the effecting hereof. It rests <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, that I<lb/>
thank your <normalised orig="Holinesse" auto="true">Holiness</normalised> for your permission and accord herein; and I pray God to<lb/>
<normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> you, for the great <normalised orig="travaile" auto="true">travail</normalised> which your <normalised orig="Holinesse" auto="true">Holiness</normalised> <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> sustained in his<lb/>
Church.<lb/>
If this was Court-dissimulation, Gods name was too far used in it,<lb/>
and the dissimulation <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> extended further than to language; the<lb/>
maine affairs of our Court and Church, for many <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised> together,<lb/>
have been conformable to the same expressions. And if here was<lb/>
plain meaning without dissimulation, no words of man can more<lb/>
fully and clearly <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> <normalised orig="Poperie" auto="true">Popery</normalised>, and protest against the novelties<lb/>
and heresies of the Reformed Churches than these do. And the Pope,<lb/>
it seems, suspected no dissimulation herein, nor his <normalised orig="Councellours" auto="true">Councellors</normalised>, and<lb/>
<normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised> Ministers, (and yet they are not usually gulled, or blinded,<lb/>
or out-done in that kind of Craft) and for proof hereof, I will<lb/>
instance in Father John de Monte-Major of the <normalised orig="Societie" auto="true">Society</normalised> of Jesus, and<lb/>
I will be very brief herein, and confine my self <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> to him. This<lb/>
Jesuite was a <normalised orig="subtile" auto="true">subtle</normalised> States-man (as we may perceive by his arguments<lb/>
now in print) and in the Iunto at Madrid, when the marriage<lb/>
of the Infanta with our Prince was upon debate, for answer to such<lb/>
difficulties and objections as some other of the Iunto had offered to<lb/>
oppose the marriage, he divers times insisted upon such points as<lb/>
these: Since the Prince is a man <normalised orig="setled" auto="true">settled</normalised> in his manners, and makes great account<lb/>
of our holy Law, it may with <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>suffi*ient</sic>

                  </choice> <normalised orig="probabilitie" auto="true">probability</normalised> be hoped, that by the<lb/>

and women, and by the <normalised orig="holinesse" auto="true">holiness</normalised> and doctrine of her <normalised orig="Confessour" auto="true">Confessor</normalised>, he will be easily<lb/>
brought to our holy faith. <notvariant>fol</notvariant>. 6.a. And therefore as we have seen that the Prince<lb/>
and his Father have kept their agreement made at the <normalised orig="Treatie" auto="true">Treaty</normalised> of peace, for the<lb/>
well using of <normalised orig="Catholicks" auto="true">Catholics</normalised>; and we are informed out of England, that this <normalised orig="yeer" auto="true">year</normalised> in<lb/>

in the <normalised orig="Embassadours" auto="true">Ambassadors</normalised> house, and that they have made 40 monuments,<lb/>
no body speaking one word to <normalised orig="controll" auto="true">control</normalised> them: <notvariant>fol</notvariant>. 7.a. Both the Prince and his<lb/>
Father do extremely desire the friendship of his <normalised orig="Holinesse" auto="true">Holiness</normalised>, and of <normalised orig="Spaine" auto="true">Spain</normalised>, which<lb/>
Henry the eighth little did care for: and thats the reason which <normalised orig="moveth" auto="true">moves</normalised> the<lb/>
Prince and his Father to procure this marriage, is to establish the said friendship<lb/>
with the <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised> See, and the Crown of <normalised orig="Spaine" auto="true">Spain</normalised>, <notvariant>fol</notvariant>. 7.b. Another <normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised><lb/>
thing to be observed is, that the Prince (as all other English and French <normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised><lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
do) <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> that we are saved, keeping the Religion of the Church of<lb/>
Rome, <notvariant>fol</notvariant>. 8.b. There are sufficient <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> <normalised orig="shewing" auto="true">showing</normalised> that the King of England is<lb/>
well affected to our Religion, since it appears he with such care and pains endeavours<lb/>
to match his Son with a Spouse so much <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>, daughter to so <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised><lb/>
Parents, and he being the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> Heir of his Kingdom, against the advice<lb/>
of all the <normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised>, and all his <normalised orig="Councellours" auto="true">Councellors</normalised>, and all the enemies of this Crown,<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> sent him with great danger of his health and life, &amp;c. All which is a great<lb/>
<normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised>, that he being moved with some great light from Heaven, desires to forsake<lb/>
the new Religion he <normalised orig="professeth" auto="true">professes</normalised>, and to return to the old one professed by his <normalised orig="Predecessours" auto="true">Predecessors</normalised>,<lb/>
for so many ages. The Prince gives clear testimony to be well affected<lb/>
to our holy Law, since he <normalised orig="beleeveth" auto="false">believed</normalised>, and <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> spoken it to divers persons, that<lb/>
those that follow the same are saved in it, &amp;c. being Grand-child to a Grandmother<lb/>
that died a Martyr. <notvariant>fol</notvariant>. 9.a. Thus great hope may be, that the whole<lb/>
Kingdom shall be reduced to the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Faith. <notvariant>fol</notvariant>. 9.b. It is to be noted<lb/>
how earnestly this match <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been pursued and treated for, both with his <normalised orig="Holinesse" auto="true">Holiness</normalised><lb/>
and other persons, debated in many Junto's by most learned men. <notvariant>fol</notvariant>. 10.b.<lb/>
There shall be kept a <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Church in London for the <normalised orig="Catholicks" auto="true">Catholics</normalised>, a Bishop of<lb/>
that <normalised orig="Citie" auto="true">City</normalised>, <normalised orig="libertie" auto="true">liberty</normalised> of conscience, the children shall be brought up by their mother<lb/>
(the Infanta) till they be fourteen <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised> of age, &amp;c.<lb/>
Where such great Agents of the Hierarchy have not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> delivered<lb/>
their judgements so plainly, but also set forth the reasons whereupon<lb/>
their judgements are grounded so clearly, I shall forbear any<lb/>
further to deliver mine. These things are <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> enough in the<lb/>
Spanish tongue. But let us stay no more upon times so long ago elapsed,<lb/>
let us for <normalised orig="brevitie" auto="false">brevity</normalised> sake omit all discourse concerning the wars in<lb/>
Bohemia, the Palatinate, Rochel, and other <normalised orig="Countreys" auto="true">Countries</normalised>, where our<lb/>
false promises of <normalised orig="supplyes" auto="true">supplies</normalised> and aids, purposely (as is thought) destroyed<lb/>

part of these last <normalised orig="twentie" auto="true">twenty</normalised> <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised>, and chiefly fix our discourse upon the<lb/>
alterations and innovations of the latter part thereof. <normalised orig="Whilest" auto="true">Whilst</normalised> the<lb/>

This violent sharp <normalised orig="maladie" auto="true">malady</normalised>, of which we labour so distressedly at<lb/>

Mathews, and some other more <normalised orig="privie" auto="true">privy</normalised> Instruments; for we must not<lb/>
think that a Nuntio was sent, till his way was before made, and entertainment<lb/>
agreed upon, and that agreement also (we must needs<lb/>
think) had its preparations, and previous considerations: but to<lb/>
limit our discourse to these last ten <normalised orig="yeers" auto="true">years</normalised>, and to give a very brief account<lb/>
of them, from the mouth of such as are not <normalised orig="partiall" auto="true">partial</normalised>, let us in<lb/>

been lately published in Print, and is <normalised orig="entituled" auto="true">entitled</normalised>, The Popes Nuntio, &amp;c.<lb/>
The Author of that Discourse, was a Venetian, and seems a man<lb/>
equally ingenuous and observing, and because he was a Papist, we<lb/>
may not think he did utter any untruth to the disadvantage of his<lb/>
own religion; and because he was <normalised orig="imployed" auto="true">employed</normalised> in State matter; at<lb/>
Court, we may <normalised orig="ghesse" auto="true">guess</normalised> that what he communicated was for the most<lb/>
part of things within his own knowledge and <normalised orig="privitie" auto="false">privity</normalised>; the piece also<lb/>
is faithfully translated out of the Italian and French, and was valued<lb/>
and preferred as a thing not fit for vulgar eyes by great Statesmen<lb/>
of other Nations; and there are few of our own Nation and Religion<lb/>
that had any sight into Court affairs, but they know well, much<lb/>
more might have been said, and is likely yet to be discovered. However<lb/>
by the light of that Pamphlet, we shall be informed, that the<lb/>
word Popery is of various ambiguous signification; so that he which<lb/>
abjures the <normalised orig="Romish" auto="true">Roman</normalised> Religion, may yet like well of a reconciliation<lb/>
with Rome. And Reconciliation in the next place, is a thing that may<lb/>
admit of such and such degrees and steps both of one side and the<lb/>
other, and such fraud may be used in a Treaty of reconciliation, that<lb/>
one side may condescend to more then is intended, and the other<lb/>

was heard to say, that He could at that time reconcile himself to<lb/>
the Church of Rome with much advantage: for our better information<lb/>
therein, and that we may neither mistake the Kings intention,<lb/>
nor conceal our own danger, let us make use of our Venetians discourse<lb/>
in these five particulars:<lb/>
1 Let us from hence learn to understand what the reconciliation<lb/>
was; and how far each side should comply and submit according<lb/>
to the capitulation.<lb/>
2 Who were the parties to be reconciled.<lb/>
3 What were the expedients and means of effecting or speeding<lb/>
this reconciliation.<lb/>
4 What that profit and great advantage was, which the King<lb/>
promised to himself by this reconciliation.<lb/>
5 What the difficulties and obstacles were which did retard this<lb/>
reconciliation.<lb/>
1 We shall do well, first to take into our consideration the articles<lb/>
and capitulation betwixt both parties, whereby it was agreed how<lb/>
far the Papists should meet the Protestants, and how far the Protestants<lb/>
should advance towards the Papists; the Pope was to move<lb/>
towards us but very slowly, in a pace exceeding <normalised orig="majesticall" auto="true">majestic</normalised>; his <normalised orig="Holinesse" auto="true">Holiness</normalised><lb/>
was pleased, not without much difficulty to <normalised orig="dispence" auto="true">dispense</normalised> with<lb/>
<normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> things: First, that marriage might be permitted to Priests:<lb/>
Secondly, that the oath of <normalised orig="Allegeance" auto="true">Allegiance</normalised> and <normalised orig="Supremacie" auto="true">Supremacy</normalised>, so far as it<lb/>
concerned the Kings <normalised orig="temporall" auto="true">temporal</normalised> power, with some mild interpretations<lb/>
or alterations might be tolerated for his Majesties <normalised orig="securitie" auto="true">security</normalised>:<lb/>
Thirdly, that the Communion might be <normalised orig="administred" auto="true">administered</normalised> sub utraque<lb/>
specie: Fourthly, that the <normalised orig="Lyturgie" auto="false">Liturgy</normalised> might be officiated in the English<lb/>
tongue. These two last Articles were for the satisfaction of the<lb/>
people. <normalised orig="Twas" auto="true">It was</normalised> the great zeal of Canterbury to capitulate for these<lb/>
things, to make the entrance of Popery the more <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>s*ooth</sic>
                     <corr>smooth</corr>
                  </choice> at first; and<lb/>
this was about the latter end of August, or the beginning of September,<lb/>
1636. during the residence of Seignior Con; and though our Venetian<lb/>
help us not herein, yet this is known sufficiently, and can be<lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
averred otherwise; nevertheless, we may probably conjecture, that<lb/>
what did concern the King herein, should have been really performed,<lb/>
so far forth as other <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Princes usually <normalised orig="injoy" auto="true">enjoy</normalised>, and expect<lb/>
as their due; and so far as the Bishops were to be independent both<lb/>
from King and Pope (which was the maine scope and purpose of<lb/>
the agreement, though not mentioned at all in the Articles) there<lb/>
was no fear of breach on the Popes part, but so far as the <normalised orig="inferiour" auto="true">inferior</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="Clergie" auto="true">Clergy</normalised>, and the people were concerned, the after performance (it<lb/>
is to be suspected) was to be left to the Popes discretion, the conditions<lb/>
being <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> of <normalised orig="temporall" auto="true">temporal</normalised> advantage, rather fit to induce than<lb/>
to confirm Popery. This seems the more likely to be true, because<lb/>
of the great <normalised orig="facilitie" auto="true">facility</normalised> which was in our Divines to comply with the<lb/>
Papists of their own accord without any <choice ana="typeset-error">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr>allurements</corr>
                  </choice>, or <normalised orig="sollicitation" auto="true">solicitation</normalised><lb/>
at all; the Papists were not so backward in walking towards<lb/>
Calvin, as the Protestants were hasty in running towards the Pope;<lb/>
for even before any Treaty at all, or before any Nuntio sent from<lb/>
Rome, we had condescended to many popish innovations, and alterations,<lb/>
both in doctrine and discipline; and <normalised orig="twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> at our <normalised orig="intreaty" auto="true">entreaty</normalised>,<lb/>
that any Nuntio was dispatched at all. It is not worth while to<lb/>
reckon up here, what novelties had been patronized, and by whom,<lb/>
how far Sparrow had paved the way for Auricular Confession, Watts<lb/>
for Penance, Heylin for Altar-worship, Mountague for Saint-worship,<lb/>
Laud for the <normalised orig="Masse" auto="true">Mass</normalised>, and many others; it is not worth while to recite,<lb/>
how far the sanctity of the Sabbath was depraved, and all <normalised orig="strictnesse" auto="true">strictness</normalised><lb/>
of life under the <normalised orig="scandall" auto="true">scandal</normalised> of <normalised orig="Puritanisme" auto="true">Puritanism</normalised> disparaged, or how <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised><lb/>
Arminianisme, Socinianisme, <normalised orig="Atheisme" auto="true">Atheism</normalised> it self was countenanced,<lb/>
the easier to debosh the <normalised orig="Clergie" auto="true">Clergy</normalised>, and people, and to prepare them for<lb/>
alterations of any kind, it having been observed; that to some men irreligion<lb/>
it self seemed <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> offensive than the Popish religion: our Venetians<lb/>
own words are; The <normalised orig="Vniversities" auto="true">Universities</normalised>, Bishops and Divines of this <normalised orig="Realme" auto="true">Realm</normalised>, do<lb/>
daily <normalised orig="imbrace" auto="true">embrace</normalised> <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> opinions, though they <normalised orig="professe" auto="true">profess</normalised> it not with open mouth,<lb/>
for fear of the <normalised orig="Puritanes" auto="true">Puritans</normalised>; for example, they hold that the Church of Rome is a<lb/>
true Church; that the Pope is <normalised orig="superiour" auto="true">superior</normalised> to all Bishops; that to him it appertains<lb/>
to call <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> <normalised orig="Councels" auto="true">Counsels</normalised>; that it is <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised> to pray for the souls departed; that<lb/>
Altars ought to be erected; in <normalised orig="summe" auto="true">sum</normalised>, they <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> all that is taught by the<lb/>
Church, but not by the Court of Rome. In another place he reports the King<lb/>
to be much a favourer of Confession, and <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised>, that by his countenance, <normalised orig="Catholicks" auto="true">Catholics</normalised><lb/>
did increase daily.<lb/>
