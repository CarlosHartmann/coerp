2. A second grace which is here <lb/>
to be exercised in the use of this <lb/>
Ordinance, and requisite to the <lb/>
sanctification of God in it, is <lb/>
Repentance. <lb/>
The Sacraments they are the <lb/>
crucifixes of Christ, in which <lb/>
Christ is represented as crucified <lb/>
afresh before our eyes: the <lb/>
bread broken <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> preach unto <lb/>
us the breaking of Christ: The <lb/>
wine <normalised orig="powred" auto="true">powered</normalised> forth <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> preach <lb/>
unto us the Blood of Christ <lb/>
poured forth for our <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised>. <lb/>
And who is it that can with the <lb/>
eye of faith, look upon a broken <lb/>
Christ, but with a broken heart? <lb/>
a wounded Christ, but with a <lb/>
wounded spirit? a bleeding Christ <lb/>
but with a bleeding <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised>? God <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> made in nature the same organ <lb/>
for seeing and weeping: And <lb/>
in grace <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> who sees clearly, <lb/>
weeps <normalised orig="throughly" auto="true">thoroughly</normalised>, Lam. 3. 5. The <lb/>
eye will affect the heart. <lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
The <normalised orig="Passeover" auto="true">Passover</normalised> under the Law <lb/>
was to be eaten with bitter herbs: <lb/>
So Christ, the true Passover, is <lb/>
here to be eaten with <normalised orig="bitternesse" auto="true">bitterness</normalised> <lb/>
of soul: as it was prophesied; They <lb/>
<normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> look on him <quote type="biblical" ana="Zech 12.10">whom they have pierced</quote>, <lb/>
and shall lament, and <normalised orig="mourne" auto="false">mourn</normalised>; <lb/>
first seeing, and then weeping, &amp;c. <lb/>
Zach. 12. 10. <lb/>
There is a twofold mourning, <lb/>
1.<normalised orig="Historicall" auto="true">Historical</normalised>; 2.<normalised orig="Spirituall" auto="true">Spiritual</normalised>. <lb/>
1.<normalised orig="Historicall" auto="true">Historical</normalised> mourning; there <lb/>
is a <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised> <normalised orig="tendernesse" auto="true">tenderness</normalised> in men <lb/>
and women, whereby their hearts <lb/>
<normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> yearn and melt to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> the <lb/>
relation, or behold the sight of <lb/>
some sad story. Such a one as Augustine <lb/>
<normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised> he had when he <lb/>
read the sad story of Dido: and <lb/>
yet his heart was hard, he could <lb/>
not mourn for sin. Or such a one <lb/>
as they had, whom Christ blamed <lb/>
in the Gospel, who lamented the <lb/>
<normalised orig="cruell" auto="true">cruel</normalised> usage of Christ out of <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised> <lb/>
compassion only; to whom <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
he saith, O <quote type="biblical" ana="Lk 23.28">daughters of Jerusalem, <lb/>
weep not for me</quote>. Of this the Father <lb/>
speaks, It is not necessary you lament <lb/>
his passion, so much as your <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised>, <lb/>
which have caused his passion. There <lb/>
is a kind of <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised> tenderness in <lb/>
men and women, <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>wihch</sic>
                     <corr>which</corr>
                  </choice> yet is often <lb/>
<normalised orig="joyned" auto="true">joined</normalised> with <normalised orig="hardnesse" auto="true">hardness</normalised> of <lb/>
heart for <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>. As an Historical <lb/>
faith, with <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> unbelief, and <lb/>
an <normalised orig="Historicall" auto="true">Historical</normalised> love, with spiritual <lb/>
enmity; so a natural <normalised orig="tendernesse" auto="true">tenderness</normalised>, <lb/>
with <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> <normalised orig="hardnesse" auto="true">hardness</normalised> of heart <lb/>
for sin. <lb/>
2.There is a <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> mourning, <lb/>
which <normalised orig="ariseth" auto="true">arises</normalised> from <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> <lb/>
grounds and causes, and tends <lb/>
to <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> ends. A sorrow <lb/>
which is caused by faith, looking <lb/>
upon heart-melting promises, or <lb/>
taking up heart-breaking considerations, <lb/>
or beholding a <normalised orig="heart-softning" auto="false">heart-softening</normalised> <lb/>
object, by which Faith <lb/>
<normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> draw waters out of the <normalised orig="fountaines" auto="true">fountains</normalised> <lb/>
of the soul for sin, as you <lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
have it, 1 Sam. 7. 6. <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Sam 7.6">they drew <lb/>
water</quote> (as out of a well) <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Sam 7.6">and poured <lb/>
it forth before the Lord</quote>. <lb/>
And this is that sorrow which is <lb/>
here to be exercised, which will <lb/>
melt and mellow the heart, and <lb/>
cause it to be more <normalised orig="fruitfull" auto="true">fruitful</normalised> in obedience. <lb/>
Never <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> the garden <lb/>
of graces better grow, then after <lb/>
such a <normalised orig="showre" auto="true">shower</normalised> of repentant tears. <lb/>
And therefore <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> God preserve <lb/>
these springs in the soul, to <lb/>
water the seeds of grace, and <lb/>
make us more <normalised orig="fruitfull" auto="true">fruitful</normalised>, which it <lb/>
surely <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> when they are <normalised orig="Sunshine-showres" auto="false">Sunshine-showers</normalised>, <lb/>
such <normalised orig="showres" auto="true">showers</normalised> <lb/>
wherein the Sun <normalised orig="appeares" auto="true">appears</normalised> Christ <lb/>
is not hid from the eye of faith. <lb/>
And, my brethren, here are <lb/>
many things in this ordinance, <lb/>
which if but looked upon with <lb/>
the eye of faith, will open all <lb/>
the springs of sorrow in the <lb/>
<normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised>, and call forth all the waters <lb/>
in him. Bellarnine he <normalised orig="layes" auto="true">lays</normalised> <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="82">G</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
down twelve considerations to <lb/>
provoke sorrow, as the miseries <lb/>
of mankind by nature, the sad <lb/>
condition of the souls in Purgatory, <lb/>
and such like <normalised orig="stuffe" auto="true">stuff</normalised>. But we <lb/>
need not be beholding to him for <lb/>
such <normalised orig="co~siderations" auto="true">considerations</normalised> as these, to occasion <lb/>
mourning. Here is enough <lb/>
in the Sacrament presented <lb/>
to the eye of faith, to <lb/>
open all the Springs thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>, <lb/>
and if thou had a <normalised orig="fountaine" auto="true">fountain</normalised> of <lb/>
<normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised>, to spend them all for <lb/>
<normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>. We will name some particulars <lb/>
here which draw out <lb/>
mournings. <lb/>
1. Here is a discovery of the <lb/>
love and <normalised orig="sweetnesse" auto="true">sweetness</normalised> of God, in <lb/>
giving his Son to die for us. So <lb/>
God loved the world, &amp;c. enough <lb/>
to cause us to <normalised orig="mourne" auto="false">mourn</normalised> that ever <lb/>
wee offended. "Oh that God <lb/>
should <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> more tender to us <lb/>
then to his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="Sonne" auto="true">Son</normalised>, not <lb/>
spare his <normalised orig="Sonne" auto="true">Son</normalised> that he might <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="83">82</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
spare us, give him to die, that we <lb/>
might live, <normalised orig="poure" auto="true">pour</normalised> the curse upon <lb/>
him, that the blessing might <lb/>
<normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> poured on us!" O how <lb/>
should this affect us! Who can <lb/>
think of this, and with-hold from <lb/>
<normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised>? <lb/>
2. Here is presented to us the <lb/>
sufferings and breakings of <lb/>
Christ, enough to break our hardest <lb/>
hearts. 1. The sufferings of <lb/>
Christ, in <normalised orig="se" auto="true">see</normalised>, in themselves, as <lb/>
those upon his body; what breakings? <lb/>
what woundings? what <lb/>
scourgings? what crownings, <lb/>
piercings, did he endure in his body? <lb/>
and those in his <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised>: What <lb/>
conflicts and <normalised orig="struglings" auto="true">strugglings</normalised> did he <lb/>
<normalised orig="undergoe" auto="true">undergo</normalised> with the wrath of God, <lb/>
the terrors of death, the powers <lb/>
of <normalised orig="darknes" auto="true">darkness</normalised>? Oh what weight, <lb/>
what burden, what wrath did <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="undergoe" auto="true">undergo</normalised>, when his <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> was <normalised orig="heavie" auto="true">heavy</normalised> <lb/>
unto death? beset with terrors, <lb/>
as the word signifies, when <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="84">G 2</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
he drank that bitter cup, that cup <lb/>
mingled with curses, which if <lb/>
Man or <normalised orig="Angell" auto="true">Angel</normalised> had but <normalised orig="sipt" auto="true">sipped</normalised> of, it <lb/>
would have sunk them into hell, <lb/>
Nay, it made him, who was God <lb/>
as well as man, sanctified by the <lb/>
Spirit, supported with the Deity, <lb/>
comforted by Angels, sweat such <lb/>
a sweat as never man sweat; drops, <lb/>
clods of blood, as the word implies. <lb/>
2. Consider them in Causa, as <lb/>
the meriting cause of all our <lb/>
good, the procurers of all our <lb/>
peace, salvation, &amp;c. <lb/>
He was wounded, that we might <lb/>
be healed; scourged, that we might <lb/>
be solaced; drunk the cup of <lb/>
wrath, a bitter cup, to procure all <lb/>
our sweet draughts: He was slain, <lb/>
saith Daniel, but not for himself; <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 53.5">he was wounded for our transgressions</quote>, <lb/>
broken for our iniquities; <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 53.5">the chastisement of our <lb/>
peace was upon him, and by his <lb/>
                     <pb n="7"/>
                     <lb/>
stripes are we healed</quote>, Isa. 53. 5, 8. <lb/>
3. Consider them as effectus peccati, <lb/>
as the effects of our sin, as <lb/>
those things our sins brought upon <lb/>
him, and needs must this melt <lb/>
and thaw our <normalised orig="Icie" auto="true">Icy</normalised> &amp;stony hearts. <lb/>
Oh, will the soul say! it <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been <lb/>
I who have been the <normalised orig="traytor" auto="true">traitor</normalised>, the <lb/>
<normalised orig="murtherer" auto="true">murderer</normalised>, my sins which have <lb/>
been bloody instruments to slay <lb/>
the Lord of glory. I have <normalised orig="sinn'd" auto="true">sinned</normalised>, <lb/>
thou <normalised orig="suffer'd" auto="true">suffered</normalised>; <normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> I that did eat <lb/>
the <normalised orig="sowre" auto="true">sour</normalised> grapes, yet thy teeth <lb/>
were set on edge; I have been thy <lb/>
death, yet thy death <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> given <lb/>
<normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> life; I have wounded thee, <lb/>
yet thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> healed me; yea, and <lb/>
even out of that wound my sins <lb/>
made, thou sent a <normalised orig="plaister" auto="true">plaster</normalised> to heal <lb/>
<normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised>. This consideration must <lb/>
needs fill the heart with sorrow, <lb/>
Zach. 12. 10. <quote type="biblical" ana="Zech 12.10">They shall look upon <lb/>
him whom they have pierced</quote>, and <lb/>
how shall this sight affect them? <lb/>
why, it follows, <quote type="biblical" ana="Zech 12.10">they shall mourn</quote>, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="86">G 3</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
and be in bitterness of soul, <quote type="biblical" ana="Zech 12.10">as one in <lb/>
bitterness for their first-born.</quote>
                  <lb/>
They say, if one man kill another, <lb/>
and you bring the <normalised orig="murtherer" auto="true">murderer</normalised> <lb/>
into the place, where the slain <lb/>
person lies, the dead will bleed <lb/>
afresh: Wee are the <normalised orig="murtherers" auto="true">murderers</normalised> <lb/>
of Christ, and we come here to an <lb/>
Ordinance where Christ is represented <lb/>
in his blood, as broken and <lb/>
wounded for our sins. O! that our <lb/>
hearts might bleed! as he bleeds <lb/>
afresh to us; so that wee might <lb/>
bleed afresh to him. A Prince <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> <lb/>
weep himself when the Page is <lb/>
whipped for him: but how should <lb/>
the Page mourn when the Prince <lb/>
is scourged for him? My brethren, <lb/>
there is infinite more disproportion <lb/>
between Christ and <lb/>
us, then between the Prince and <lb/>
the Page, the Lord and the slave. <lb/>
And how can we then look upon <lb/>
him as wounded, scourged, pierced, <lb/>
for us, &amp;not be affected with, <lb/>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
afflicted for our sin, the cause of it. <lb/>
Bernard saith, If thou would be <lb/>
conformable to Christ (in the Sacrament) <lb/>
as thou <normalised orig="beholdest" auto="true">behold</normalised> a broken <lb/>
&amp;a bleeding Christ, so labour <lb/>
to behold him w<hi rend="high">th</hi> a broken bleeding <lb/>
heart. Look on him in this <lb/>
Ordinance, as Mary looked upon <lb/>
him on the Cross, when Simeon's <lb/>
<normalised orig="Prophesie" auto="true">Prophecy</normalised> was fulfilled, that a <lb/>
sword should pass through her <lb/>
soul; Luke 2. 35. for then indeed <lb/>
did a sword pass through her soul, <lb/>
when she saw him pierced on the <lb/>
cross: so when you see him pierced <lb/>
                  <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>andbroken</sic>
                     <corr>and broken</corr>
                  </choice> in the Sacrament, <lb/>
which is the lively representation <lb/>
of Christ broken, Oh, that then it <lb/>
might be as a spear to our hearts! <lb/>
as a sword to our spirits, that we <lb/>
by our sins have wounded and <lb/>
pierced him! <lb/>
This is the second grace to <lb/>
be exercised in this Ordinance. <lb/>
And beside these two, there are <lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
many more to be exercised here, <lb/>
viz. Our love to God, our <normalised orig="hungring" auto="true">hungering</normalised> <lb/>
and thirsting after Christ. <lb/>
There is that in Christ represented <lb/>
to the eye of faith in this Sacrament, <lb/>
that calls out for all the <lb/>
affections, dispositions, and desires <lb/>
in you; You cannot see <lb/>
Christ here, but it will make every <lb/>
grace within you stir, every <lb/>
disposition within you to move, <lb/>
every wheel go. Who can see him <lb/>
but love him, who is so exceeding <lb/>
lovely? Who can see him but <lb/>
prize him, who is so exceeding <lb/>
precious? Who can see him but <lb/>
desire him, who is so exceeding <lb/>
<normalised orig="desireable" auto="true">desirable</normalised>? Who can see him but <lb/>
delight in him, who is the joy <lb/>
and delight of the soul? You <lb/>
cannot possibly see him here, but <lb/>
all the powers of the soul will <lb/>
be up. 1. Your judgements to <lb/>
prize him, your wills to choose <lb/>
him, and make a new match with <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="89">88</fw>

                  <lb/>
him; your affections to love him, <lb/>
embrace him, delight in him. And <lb/>
the clearer your sight is here of <lb/>
Christ by faith, the more will your <lb/>
hearts be stirred, your spirits moved. <lb/>
Men that sit here as logs <lb/>
&amp;lumps of clay never stirred, never <lb/>
taken up, they see not Christ, <lb/>
they see no higher then the table, <lb/>
the Bread and Wine, and therefore <lb/>
dead and <normalised orig="sensless" auto="true">senseless</normalised>. Oh! but <choice ana="print-error">

one <normalised orig="crevise" auto="false">crevice</normalised> of your hearts were <lb/>
opened, to let in but one beam, <lb/>
one glimpse of Christ, it would <lb/>
set you all on a burning heavenly <lb/>
fire, this would warm you indeed. <lb/>
But besides these graces to be exercised, <lb/>
there is required some <lb/>
demeanours in the soul in this <lb/>
Ordinance, if we would <normalised orig="sanctifie" auto="true">sanctify</normalised> <lb/>
God in it. <lb/>
1. An humble and holy reverence, <lb/>
which is the fruit of that <lb/>
dread and fear of God which is <lb/>
in the heart. There is abundance <lb/>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
of lightness, looseness and vanity <lb/>
in the spirits of men by nature. <lb/>
And the Majesty and dread of <lb/>
that great God, with whom wee <lb/>
have to do in this Ordinance, <lb/>
must consolidate, and make our <lb/>
spirits weighty in these great Ordinances. <lb/>
The Sacrament is called <lb/>
an Eucharist, it is a gratulatory <lb/>
service, and God is <normalised orig="fearfull" auto="true">fearful</normalised> in <lb/>
praises, Exod. 15. 11. which <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised> respect to the affection <lb/>
wherewith you are to praise him. <lb/>
2. There is required a discharge <lb/>
&amp;dismission of all worldly <lb/>
thoughts and businesses. When <lb/>
Abraham went up to the Mount <lb/>
to sacrifice, he left his servants in <lb/>
the valley. Thou art now to go <lb/>
up to the mount, where God appears. <lb/>
Oh! leave all your servile <lb/>
affections, your worldly thoughts <lb/>
in the valley. And if any enter, <lb/>
do as Abraham did by the Birds <lb/>
that would have eaten up his sacrifice, <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="91">90</fw>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
chase them away; do by <lb/>
them as you do by straggling <lb/>
beggars, give them their pass, and <lb/>
send them away. <lb/>
In the Temple, though there <lb/>
was so much flesh for sacrifice, yet <lb/>
there was not one <normalised orig="Flie" auto="true">Fly</normalised> appeared <lb/>
stirring; oh that it might be so <lb/>
with us this day! that not one <lb/>
thought might arise upon our <lb/>
hearts, <normalised orig="unsutable" auto="true">unsuitable</normalised> to the place and <lb/>
work in hand. It is a thing unbefitting <lb/>
these great <normalised orig="imployments" auto="true">employments</normalised>, <lb/>
to have our hearts and thoughts <lb/>
taken up with other businesses; <lb/>
what have you to do here with <lb/>
your shops, your bags, your <lb/>
chests? What have you here to <lb/>
do with things of this world? <lb/>
Oh make not this place an Exchange, <lb/>
a Shop for <normalised orig="merchandize" auto="true">merchandise</normalised>, <lb/>
men are not able to do business in <lb/>
a crowd, nor you so great a business <lb/>
as this in a crowd of thoughts. <lb/>
But this is the misery, you are <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="92">91</fw>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
servants and slaves to the world at <lb/>
other times, and therefore the <lb/>
world will master you now. If you <lb/>
pass over your hearts to the service <lb/>
of the world at other times, <lb/>
the world will make you serve it <lb/>
now. Because you have not <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> <lb/>
hearts in your <normalised orig="temporall" auto="true">temporal</normalised> employments, <lb/>
therefore have you <lb/>
<normalised orig="carnall" auto="true">carnal</normalised> hearts in your <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> <lb/>
employments. The <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> of the <lb/>
Sabbath in the week, the more you <lb/>
shall find of the week in the Sabbath. <lb/>
The <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> you are <lb/>
in affairs of earth, the more <normalised orig="carnall" auto="true">carnal</normalised> <lb/>
you will <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> in the employments <lb/>
of Heaven. This is <lb/>
certain, if the world once take <lb/>
your heart, it will take your head <lb/>
also. I say, if ever the world leaven <lb/>
your hearts, it will also <normalised orig="poyson" auto="true">poison</normalised> <lb/>
your heads; it is a leaven <normalised orig="diffuseth" auto="true">diffuses</normalised> <lb/>
it self through the whole man. <lb/>
And therefore as Christ said <lb/>
of the leaven of the Pharisees, <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="93">92</fw>
                  <pb n="15"/>

Principles are unsound, then are <lb/>

you be servants to the world at other <lb/>
times, the world will <normalised orig="co~mand" auto="true">command</normalised> <lb/>
and master you now. Thus much <lb/>
shall serve for the second <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> <lb/>
Head, what is required in the <lb/>
time for the sanctification of this ordinance. <lb/>
We come to the third. <lb/>
To the sanctifying God in an <lb/>
Ordinance, is required <normalised orig="somthing" auto="true">something</normalised> <lb/>
after. And <lb/>
That now which is required <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterwards</normalised>, <lb/>
is, That you labour to <lb/>
                  <pb n="16"/>
                  <lb/>
see the fruit of this ordinance to <lb/>
run <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> through your lives. <lb/>
Thou <normalised orig="exercisedst" auto="false">exercised</normalised> faith, labour to <lb/>
see thy heart more established in <lb/>

more strengthened, thy corruptions <lb/>

<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> two things which are to <lb/>

ordinance, if ever you would <normalised orig="sanctifie" auto="true">sanctify</normalised> <lb/>
God in it: <lb/>
1. <normalised orig="Thankfulnesse" auto="true">Thankfulness</normalised>, <lb/>
2. Obedience. <lb/>

praise and thanksgiving. If <lb/>
God <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> but feed your bodies, <lb/>
there is none, I hope, such beasts, <lb/>
as will not return the retribution <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="95">94</fw>
                  <pb n="17"/>
                  <lb/>
of praises: And will you be slow <lb/>
and backward to it when he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
fed your souls? Shall we <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> <lb/>
God for a Crumb, and not for a <lb/>
Christ? Other mercies are but <lb/>
crumbs in comparison of this <lb/>
rich mercy, and shall our hearts <lb/>
favour <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>themso</sic>
                     <corr>them so</corr>

only <normalised orig="bestowes" auto="true">bestows</normalised> on his friends: and <lb/>
shall we be unthankful for them? <lb/>
How ever <normalised orig="carnall" auto="true">carnal</normalised> men are most <lb/>
taken with carnal things; yet sure <lb/>
I am, those who are <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised>, as <lb/>
they are most apprehensive of <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> <lb/>
wants; so the greatest layings <lb/>
out of their spirits in <normalised orig="thankfulnesse" auto="true">thankfulness</normalised>, <lb/>
is for <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> enjoyments. <lb/>
What's <normalised orig="corne" auto="true">corn</normalised> and wine, <lb/>
&amp;c. to this? This is a <normalised orig="mercie" auto="true">mercy</normalised> in <lb/>
which all other mercies are folded <lb/>

                  <pb n="18"/>
                  <lb/>
the top-mercy. God <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> eminently <lb/>
contain <normalised orig="al" auto="true">all</normalised> other comforts, <lb/>
and therefore in the want of all <lb/>
he can <normalised orig="cheere" auto="true">cheer</normalised> the heart, Hah. 3. <lb/>
7. So Christ <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> eminently <lb/>
contain all other mercies, and in <lb/>
the want of all, Christ enjoyed, <lb/>
is exceeding great reward. Nay, <lb/>
all mercies are not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> folded <lb/>
up in him, and <normalised orig="intail'd" auto="true">entailed</normalised> to him, but <lb/>
he sweetens and sanctifies every <lb/>
<normalised orig="mercie" auto="true">mercy</normalised>. Let us then return home <lb/>
as full of the blessing from on <lb/>
high, so full of praises to the most <lb/>
high. <normalised orig="Thankfulnesse" auto="true">Thankfulness</normalised> is the great <lb/>
grace to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> exercised in, and <lb/>
<normalised orig="thankfulnesse" auto="true">thankfulness</normalised> is the great grace <lb/>
to be exercised after; and therefore <lb/>
while the present sense of <lb/>
this <normalised orig="mercie" auto="true">mercy</normalised> <normalised orig="warmes" auto="false">warms</normalised> your hearts, <lb/>
let the heat of it burst forth into <lb/>
<normalised orig="thankfulnesse" auto="true">thankfulness</normalised> towards God; it is <lb/>
the most <normalised orig="sutable" auto="true">suitable</normalised> service, and the <lb/>
most <normalised orig="sutable" auto="true">suitable</normalised> time to <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised> it. <lb/>
The best time to have <choice ana="print-error">

in our hearts, is when we can look <lb/>
there, and <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> the mercy for w<hi rend="high">ch</hi>
                  <lb/>
we praise him also. The best time <lb/>
for praises and thankfulness in <lb/>
our mouths, is when wee have the <lb/>
blessing in our hands. Well then, <lb/>
all you who are right partakers <lb/>
of this Ordinance, summon up <lb/>
your hearts to return thankfulness <lb/>
to God. And let your thankfulness <lb/>
carry some proportion with <lb/>
the mercy. The mercy is great, do <lb/>
but measure it in all the dimensions <lb/>
of it, how high? how deep? <lb/>
how broad a mercy? pardoning, <lb/>
purging mercy, and how long? <lb/>
even to all eternity; And as the <lb/>
mercy is great, so should be the <lb/>
praises. (The more a man's apprehensions <lb/>
are enwidened to conceive <lb/>
of the vastness and greatness <lb/>
of the mercy, the more will the <lb/>
affections be <normalised orig="inlarged" auto="true">enlarged</normalised> to praise <lb/>
him for it. There was never man <lb/>
that did know the preciousness of <lb/>

                  <lb/>
Christ, and his own need of him, <lb/>
in respect of pardon, purging, and <lb/>
his own unworthiness to partake <lb/>
of so glorious a mercy, but had <lb/>
his heart mightily <normalised orig="inlarged" auto="true">enlarged</normalised> to <lb/>
praise God for it. This is that <lb/>
then which God expects at your <lb/>
hands, after he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> filled you with <lb/>
the blessing of Heaven, that you <lb/>
should return praises to Heaven. <lb/>
Though <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not reap where <lb/>
he <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not sow, as that idle servant <lb/>
charged him; yet where God <lb/>
<normalised orig="sowes" auto="true">sows</normalised> blessings, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> expects to reap <lb/>
praises. Where there is a flood of <lb/>
mercy, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> looks for a stream of <lb/>
thankfulness. Oh! then let us <lb/>
proportion our returns to our <lb/>
<normalised orig="receits" auto="true">receipts</normalised>, let us set up monuments <lb/>
of praise in our hearts and lives <lb/>
for this great mercy; Say with <lb/>
David, <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 103.1">Bless the Lord, o my soul</quote> &amp;c. <lb/>
2. The second thing required <lb/>
after this Ordinance, is obedience <lb/>
and <normalised orig="fruitfulnes" auto="false">fruitfulness</normalised>. That now for the <lb/>
                  <pb n="21"/>
                  <lb/>
time to come, you should apply <lb/>
your hearts to walk more worthy <lb/>

1. That we should have our <lb/>
hearts further set against sin: <lb/>
2. That we should have our hearts <lb/>
further <normalised orig="strengthned" auto="true">strengthened</normalised> to service. <lb/>
1. Get your hearts now further <lb/>
set against sin. Oh! let your <lb/>
souls say, "<normalised orig="Hath" auto="true">Has</normalised> God been so <lb/>

my pardon, and shall I again <lb/>

strengthened to service. Here <lb/>
is in this Ordinance a <normalised orig="mutuall" auto="true">mutual</normalised> <lb/>
sealing of Covenants between <lb/>
God and you. As God seals to <lb/>
thee, so thou seals again to God. <lb/>
God seals to the first part of the <lb/>
Covenant, pardon, mercy, grace; <lb/>
and thou seals to the second part <lb/>
of it, service, subjection, obedience: <lb/>
God gives Christ to thee here <lb/>
in this Ordinance, and thou gives <lb/>
thy self back again to Christ. As <lb/>

                  <lb/>
there is matter of <normalised orig="bountie" auto="true">bounty</normalised> from <lb/>
God to thee, so there is matter <lb/>
of duty from thee to God; God <lb/>
here in bounty <normalised orig="bestowes" auto="true">bestows</normalised> Christ upon <lb/>
every humble, broken hearted <lb/>
and believing receiver: They take <lb/>
him, and re-give themselves back <lb/>
again to him for subjection and <lb/>
obedience. There was never any <lb/>
soul, to whom God said in this <lb/>
Ordinance, I am thine, whose <lb/>
hearts did not <normalised orig="eccho" auto="true">echo</normalised> again the <lb/>
same to God, Lord, I am thine. <lb/>
This head is thine to contrive <lb/>
thy glory, this hand is thine to <lb/>
work for thee, this <normalised orig="hart" auto="true">heart</normalised> is thine to <lb/>
love thee, He that <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised>, <quote type="biblical" ana="Song 2.16">my beloved <lb/>
is mine,</quote> <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> again, <quote type="biblical" ana="Song 2.16">and I am his</quote>; <lb/>
Cant. 2. 16. Let us then labour <lb/>
to see our hearts further strengthened <lb/>
to service; let this <normalised orig="inable" auto="true">enable</normalised> <lb/>
thee to walk: <lb/>
1. More strongly; The Sacraments <lb/>
are our <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> baitings <lb/>
and refreshments which God affords <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="102">H 3</fw>
                  <pb n="24"/>
                  <lb/>
us to strengthen us in our <lb/>
journey to Heaven: They are <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> <lb/>
meat &amp;drink to strengthen <lb/>
us in the performance of <normalised orig="al" auto="true">all</normalised> <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> <lb/>
obedience; such meat as will <lb/>
not only <normalised orig="inable" auto="true">enable</normalised> a man to work, <lb/>
but to work more strongly. And <lb/>
<normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> to be feared, that they who <lb/>
are never the stronger for service, <lb/>
feed not upon the substance, <lb/>
but upon the shadow, they feed upon <lb/>
the elements, but never <normalised orig="tast" auto="true">taste</normalised> of <lb/>
Christ the staff of nourishment; <lb/>
and <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> true here, the <normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> element <lb/>
is no nourishment. <lb/>
2. More willingly and cheerfully; <lb/>
Then shall wee be able to run <lb/>
the <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> of God's <normalised orig="Commandements" auto="true">Commandments</normalised>, <lb/>
when God once here <normalised orig="inlarges" auto="true">enlarges</normalised> our <lb/>
hearts. It is said of Jacob, that <lb/>
when he had been refreshed with <lb/>
the presence of God, he plucked <lb/>
up his feet, and went on cheerfully. <lb/>
So here, when the soul <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
been refreshed with the presence <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="103">102</fw>
                  <pb n="25"/>
                  <lb/>
of Christ, he will be able to walk <lb/>
more cheerfully in the <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> of <lb/>
God. The food we feed upon is <lb/>
<normalised orig="Angels'" auto="true">Angels</normalised> food, and will <normalised orig="inable" auto="true">enable</normalised> us to <lb/>
<normalised orig="Angels'" auto="true">Angels</normalised> <normalised orig="imployments" auto="true">employments</normalised>, h. e. to do <lb/>
our work with an Angels spirit, <lb/>
with all alacrity, cheerfulness, <lb/>
joy and delight; though not in <lb/>
the same equality, yet in the same <lb/>
quality, though not in the same <lb/>
measure, yet in the same manner. <lb/>
And thus much for the second <lb/>
<normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised>, viz. How we must <normalised orig="sanctifie" auto="true">sanctify</normalised> <lb/>
God in an Ordinance. <lb/>
Wee will now come to the <lb/>
third <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised>, which is the Reasons <lb/>
why, Who ever have to do with <lb/>
an Ordinance of God, must <normalised orig="sanctifie" auto="true">sanctify</normalised> <lb/>
God in it. <lb/>
1. Reason. Because God commands <lb/>
it. God saith <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> will be <lb/>
sanctified; and God's will is our <lb/>
law. God <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not only command <lb/>
the substance, but the circumstances; <lb/>
not only the matter of worship, <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="104">103</fw>
                  <pb n="26"/>
                  <lb/>
but the manner: And though the <lb/>
matter be good, if the manner of <lb/>
performance be <normalised orig="naught" auto="true">nought</normalised>, God <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <lb/>
not regard it. You see what <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <lb/>
saith to the <normalised orig="Jewes" auto="true">Jews</normalised>, He that <normalised orig="sacrificeth" auto="true">sacrifices</normalised>, <lb/>
is as he who killed a man, and <lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> that <normalised orig="kils" auto="true">kills</normalised> <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 66.3">a Lamb, as if he cut off <lb/>
a Dog's head</quote>, and <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 66.3">he who <normalised orig="burneth" auto="true">burns</normalised> incense</quote>, <lb/>
as <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> who <normalised orig="blesseth" auto="true">blesses</normalised> an <normalised orig="Idoll" auto="true">Idol</normalised>, <lb/>
Isa. 66. 3. These seem strange expressions. <lb/>
What, were not these <lb/>
such duties as God commanded? <lb/>
<normalised orig="Doth" auto="true">Does</normalised> not God command sacrifice? <lb/>
&amp;c. Yes, but because they <lb/>
did them not in that manner God <lb/>
commanded, therefore were they <lb/>
abominable to him. If therefore <lb/>
thou gives God the bulk of outward <lb/>
performance, without the <lb/>
spirit of devotion, thou deals by <lb/>
him as Prometheus by Jupiter, who <lb/>
did eat the flesh, and present him <lb/>
with nothing but bones, covered <lb/>
over with skin; Or, to use the <lb/>
Scripture phrase, you compass God <lb/>
                  <pb n="27"/>
                  <lb/>
with a lie, Hos. 11. 12. Thou gives <lb/>
him the shell of outward performance, <lb/>
but not the <normalised orig="kernell" auto="true">kernel</normalised> of inward <lb/>
devotion: thou gives him <lb/>
a body without a soul; And as the <lb/>
body without the soul is dead and <lb/>
stinks, so <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> that service which <lb/>
wants the spirit: As God's will <lb/>
<normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> command service, so our <lb/>
will and affections must perform <lb/>
service. Though our will <lb/>
must be no instrument of devising <lb/>
service, yet it must be an <normalised orig="instrume~t" auto="true">instrument</normalised> <lb/>
in performing service. Though <lb/>
God will not own will-worship in <lb/>
regard of prescription, yet he will <lb/>
own it in regard of performance, <lb/>
and none else. <lb/>
Thus you see God commands <lb/>
it, and therefore, &amp;c. <lb/>
2. Reason. Because otherwise <lb/>
wee get no good by this Ordinance, <lb/>
no good of Comfort, nor <lb/>
none of Grace. If indeed the Sacraments <lb/>
did ex opere operato, confer <lb/>
                  <pb n="28"/>
                  <lb/>
Grace; or if that this Sacrament <lb/>
were an Instrument for the <lb/>
begetting of Grace in graceless <lb/>
hearts, then might you get good, <lb/>
though you came unpreparedly. <lb/>
The word, it is set up for that end, <lb/>
to be the instrument of regeneration; <lb/>
and therefore, though you <lb/>
come unpreparedly thither, yet <lb/>
you may be wrought upon there. <lb/>
Many that have come to the <lb/>
Word with purpose to scoff, to <lb/>
taunt, to deride, nay, to <normalised orig="insnare" auto="true">ensnare</normalised> <lb/>
and accuse, who yet have been <lb/>
wrought on there, and sent away <lb/>
other men. Were the Sacraments <lb/>
set up for such an end, to <lb/>
beget grace, where there is no <lb/>
grace, then might you get good, <lb/>
though you come unpreparedly <lb/>
and unsanctifiedly thither; <lb/>
but as I have told you, it was <lb/>
never set up for such an end: <lb/>
here its true, habenti dabitur, to <lb/>
him that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> shall be given; he <lb/>
                  <pb n="29"/>
                  <lb/>
that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> grace shall in the exercise <lb/>
improve his graces, but he <lb/>
that comes graceless hither, goes <lb/>
graceless away, nay, worse then <lb/>
he came, which is the next Reason. <lb/>
3. Reason. Because otherwise <lb/>
we get much hurt. <lb/>
The Ordinances are not idle, <lb/>
but operative, they either work <lb/>
for life, or they work for death. <lb/>
As Paul said of the Word, it was <lb/>
the favour of life and of death; so <lb/>
I may say of every Ordinance. <lb/>
There is never a time you come <lb/>
to hear the Word, but you are set <lb/>
a step <normalised orig="neerer" auto="true">nearer</normalised> heaven or hell: so <lb/>
never a time you come to receive <lb/>
the Sacraments, &amp;c. The fruit of <lb/>
the tree of Knowledge of good <lb/>
and <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> might be <normalised orig="wholsome" auto="true">wholesome</normalised> in it <lb/>
self: yet Adam did eat his death, <lb/>
when he tasted of it contrary to <lb/>
God's command. So here the Sacrament, <lb/>
though in it self it be <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="108">107</fw>
                  <pb n="30"/>
                  <lb/>
good, yet it becomes the bane and <lb/>
destruction of those souls, who <lb/>
partake thereof unworthily: As <lb/>
the Ordinances of God are precious <lb/>
things when God is sanctified <lb/>
in them; so they are costly things, <lb/>
when <normalised orig="prophan'd" auto="true">profaned</normalised>. Hezekiah knew <lb/>
this full well, and therefore <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="prayes" auto="true">prays</normalised>, Now <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Chr 30.18">the good Lord pardon</quote>
                  <lb/>
all those who come to seek the God of <lb/>
their Fathers, though they are not <lb/>
prepared according to the preparation <lb/>
of the Sanctuary; he saw the danger <lb/>
of the unsanctified use of Ordinances. <lb/>
To be short, it will bring upon <lb/>
thee, 1. <normalised orig="Corporall" auto="true">Corporal</normalised> hurt; you see <lb/>
this in the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 11. <lb/>
30. <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 11.30">For this cause many are weak and <lb/>
sickly among you, and many are fallen <lb/>
asleep.</quote> It was some <normalised orig="Epidemicall" auto="true">Epidemical</normalised> <lb/>
disease, <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 28.15">
                     <lb/>
                     flagellum inundans
                     <lb/>
                  </quote>, some <lb/>
over-flowing scourge, whereby <lb/>
God swept away many, in all the <lb/>
quarters of the Church; and will <lb/>
                  <pb n="31"/>
                  <lb/>
you know what was the ground, <lb/>
what was the reason of it? The <lb/>
Apostle <normalised orig="tels" auto="true">tells</normalised> us; that in the beginning, <lb/>
it was for this cause, viz. the <lb/>
<normalised orig="prophanation" auto="true">profanation</normalised>, or unsanctified use <lb/>
of this Ordinance, there was <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Kings 4.40">
                     <lb/>
                     mors <lb/>
in olla
                     <lb/>
                  </quote>, death in the cup, they partaked <lb/>
of the cup of the Lord unworthily, <lb/>
and drank their own <lb/>
death in it; the cup of life was <lb/>
become a cup of death, the blood <lb/>
of pardon a cup of guilt. <lb/>
2. <normalised orig="Spirituall" auto="true">Spiritual</normalised> hurt; though God <lb/>
do not break out in visible judgements <lb/>
upon the <normalised orig="carkasses" auto="true">carcasses</normalised> of men <lb/>
as formerly, yet the curse of God <lb/>
eats secretly into the consciences <lb/>
of men. You cause God to give <lb/>
you up to blindness of <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>, <lb/>
hardness of heart, and these are <lb/>
curses with a witness; the curse <lb/>
of curses is a hard heart. <lb/>
3. It puts you in danger of <normalised orig="eternall" auto="true">eternal</normalised> <lb/>
judgement. The Apostle <normalised orig="tels" auto="true">tells</normalised> <lb/>
you so, 1 Corinth. 11. 29. verse. <lb/>
                  <pb n="32"/>
                  <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 11.29">He that eats and drinks unworthily</quote>, <lb/>
eats &amp;drinks his own damnation: <lb/>
Better, saith Ambrose, that a <normalised orig="milstone" auto="true">millstone</normalised> <lb/>
were tied about thy neck, and <lb/>
thou cast into the midst of the sea; <lb/>
then to take the least bit of bread, or <lb/>
drop of wine from the Minister, with <lb/>
an unsanctified heart, and polluted <lb/>
conscience. And thus much for <lb/>
the <normalised orig="doctrinall" auto="false">doctrinal</normalised> part, wee will now <lb/>
come to the application. <lb/>
<normalised orig="Vse" auto="true">Use</normalised> 1. If so, that whoever <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> to do with an Ordinance <lb/>
must <normalised orig="sanctifie" auto="true">sanctify</normalised> God in it; and <lb/>
that there is so much required <lb/>
before, so much in the time, so <lb/>
much <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterwards</normalised>; Oh! how few <lb/>
then shall we <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised>, that <normalised orig="sanctifie" auto="true">sanctify</normalised> <lb/>
God in this Ordinance? Some <lb/>
there are, who openly <normalised orig="prophane" auto="true">profane</normalised> <lb/>
this Ordinance, some who steal <lb/>
a draught of damnation to themselves, <lb/>
your close and <normalised orig="civill" auto="true">civil</normalised> men; <lb/>
this is the difference, where the <lb/>
common <normalised orig="prophane" auto="true">profane</normalised> man goes to <lb/>
                  <pb n="33"/>
                  <lb/>
hell the plain road way, this man <lb/>
steals to hell <normalised orig="behinde" auto="true">behind</normalised> the hedge; <lb/>
And indeed, the best of men do <lb/>
not <normalised orig="sanctifie" auto="true">sanctify</normalised> God as they ought <lb/>
in them. Alas, what preparation <lb/>
before wee come upon these Ordinances? <lb/>
What exciting and <lb/>
stirring up of our graces? What <lb/>
exercise of grace here? Faith, Repentance? <lb/>
What thankfulness? <lb/>
What obedience afterwards? <lb/>
Where is the fruit of so many <lb/>
Sermons, Sacraments; have they <lb/>
not been like rain that falls on the <lb/>
rocks? Are not all these like so <lb/>
many clouds which pass over our <lb/>
heads, and leave never a drop of <lb/>
moisture <normalised orig="behinde" auto="true">behind</normalised>? Are wee not <lb/>
like Pharaoh's lean <normalised orig="Kine" auto="true">Kin</normalised>, never the <lb/>
fatter for all our feeding? Are we <lb/>
not like men sick of Atrophy, <lb/>
who, though they feed upon never <lb/>
so good nourishment, yet <lb/>
they grow not thereby? Do wee <lb/>
not shame our meat, discredit <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="112">111</fw>
                  <pb n="34"/>
                  <lb/>
those heavenly dainties, that we <lb/>
thrive no more by them? Other <lb/>
ages, like Leah, were bleer-eyed, <lb/>
but <normalised orig="fruitfull" auto="true">fruitful</normalised>: ours like Rachel, <lb/>
<normalised orig="beautifull" auto="true">beautiful</normalised>, but yet barren: Wee <lb/>
answer not God's care and cost <lb/>
towards us; we profit not; wee <lb/>
grow not; and what's the reason? <lb/>
Because we do not <normalised orig="sanctifie" auto="true">sanctify</normalised> God <lb/>
as we ought in these Ordinances; <lb/>
therefore are we so weak in faith, <lb/>
therefore so feeble in grace; <normalised orig="therfore" auto="true">therefore</normalised> <lb/>
corruptions so strong in us: <lb/>
they who look the Ordinances <lb/>
should be means for the perfecting <lb/>
of their sanctification, they <lb/>
must labour to <normalised orig="sanctifie" auto="true">sanctify</normalised> God in <lb/>
them. <lb/>
