WE have a Proverbial saying<lb/>
amongst us, that Every one that<lb/>
is forty years old, is either a<lb/>
Fool or a Physician: But without<lb/>
a Proverb to <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> the<lb/>
undertaking, there are but few that (at<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="2">C4</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
what age <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised>) do not think themselves<lb/>
at years of discretion enough, to pass a judgement<lb/>
upon, and prescribe to the Body <normalised orig="Politick" auto="true">Politic</normalised>,<lb/>
whether Church or State. Though it<lb/>
usually happens, that such <normalised orig="Empiricks" auto="false">empirics</normalised>, either<lb/>
to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> their wit (suspecting distempers<lb/>
where there are none) make them; or<lb/>
<normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> they rashly adventure quieta movere,<lb/>
and like Englishmen will be <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> mending,<lb/>
they make work for better skill than<lb/>
their own; or lastly, if they discover some<lb/>
small matter amiss, mistaking the cause of<lb/>
it, not only lose their time and labour<lb/>
(which would be easily pardonable) but exhaust<lb/>
the spirits of the Patient with improper<lb/>
medicines, and purge out the good and<lb/>
useful juices as noxious humours, and so the<lb/>
Physician becomes far the greater disease of<lb/>
the two.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
That our Church is of a sound and<lb/>
healthful constitution, and might have continued<lb/>
so, had it not met with this fortune,<lb/>
I think I have sufficiently, though briefly<lb/>
manifested in the foregoing Introduction:<lb/>
But some men either loving to be <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised><lb/>
reforming, or having first separated from it,<lb/>
that they may either commend their own<lb/>
skill, or <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> their own fact, must accuse<lb/>
the Church.<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
We read of Brutus, that having killed<lb/>
<normalised orig="Cæsar" auto="true">Caesar</normalised>, he was <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> after inveighing against<lb/>
him as a Tyrant, Ità enim facto ejus expediebat,<lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>sai*</sic>
                     <corr>saith</corr>
                  </choice> the Historian, It was expedient<lb/>
he should call <normalised orig="Cæsar" auto="true">Caesar</normalised> Tyrant, for otherwise<lb/>
himself must be a notorious <normalised orig="Traytor" auto="true">Traitor</normalised>. So<lb/>
these men, though the greatest disorders of<lb/>
the Church be but what themselves have<lb/>
made, must find faults, that they may not<lb/>
seem to have raised all the dust, and withdrawn<lb/>
themselves and others from it without<lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>cau*e</sic>
                     <corr>cause</corr>
                  </choice>.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
1. And in the first place the Doctrine of<lb/>
this Church is blamed; though thanks be to<lb/>
God, there are but few that are of so little discretion<lb/>
as to bring in this charge, and those<lb/>
that are, will never be able to prove it.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
The main (if not the only) thing excepted<lb/>
against in this kind, is, that the thirty<lb/>
nine Articles are not so punctual in defining<lb/>
the five points debated at the Synod of Dort<lb/>
as they could wish. But this though it neither<lb/>
needs nor deserves an answer, yet I shall<lb/>
reply these two things to it.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
First, That it is not so with the Doctrine<lb/>
of Christianity as with common Arts and<lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
Sciences, which depend upon humane wit<lb/>
and invention, and consequently are capable<lb/>
of daily improvements: For the mind of<lb/>
man having not an intuitive knowledge, but<lb/>
proceeding by way of discourse, discovers<lb/>
one thing by another, and infers things from<lb/>
one another; so that there is not a Nè plus<lb/>
ultrà in those things, but daily new discoveries,<lb/>
                  &amp; dies diem docet. Whereto accords<lb/>
the saying of wise men, Antiquitas<lb/>
sæculi, est juventus mundi; That which we<lb/>
call the old World, is but indeed the infancy<lb/>
of knowledge, and the latter Times must<lb/>
needs have as much the advantage of truth<lb/>
as they have of deliberation and experiment.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
But it is quite otherwise with Christianity,<lb/>
for that depending solely upon Divine<lb/>
Revelation, can admit of no new discoveries;<lb/>
time may obscure it, and the <normalised orig="busie" auto="true">busy</normalised><lb/>
wit of man may perplex and confound it<lb/>
with its inventions, but can never discover<lb/>
any thing new, or bring to light any truth<lb/>
that was not so from the beginning. For if<lb/>
we admit of new Revelations, we lose the<lb/>
old and our Religion together, we accuse<lb/>
our Saviour and his Apostles as if they had<lb/>
not sufficiently revealed Gods mind to the<lb/>
world, and we <normalised orig="incurr" auto="true">incur</normalised> St. Paul's Anathema
                  <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
which he denounces against him (whosoever<lb/>
it shall be, nay, if an Angel from Heaven)<lb/>
that shall preach any other doctrine than<lb/>
what had been received. And St. Jude <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised><lb/>
told us the Faith was once, that is either at<lb/>
once, or once for <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>a*l</sic>
                     <corr>all</corr>
                  </choice>, delivered to or by the<lb/>
Saints. But if we shall pretend a private<lb/>
Spirit or Revelation to discover and interpret<lb/>
what was before delivered, we do as <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised>;<lb/>
we suppose Christ and his Apostles <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>n*t</sic>
                     <corr>not</corr>
                  </choice> to<lb/>
be able to deliver the mind of God, and we<lb/>
open a Gap for all Impostures and delusions<lb/>
perpetually to infest and corrupt Christian<lb/>
Doctrine.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
The consequence of these premises is, that<lb/>
(contrary to what I affirmed before of other<lb/>
Sciences) the elder any Doctrine of Christianity<lb/>
can be proved to be, it must needs be<lb/>
the truer, and accordingly deserve the greater<lb/>
veneration from us, as coming nearer the<lb/>
fountain of Evangelical Truth, Divine Revelation:<lb/>
and that he that talks of more clear<lb/>
Light of the latter times, and clearer discoveries<lb/>
in Religion, talks as foolishly as he<lb/>
that should affirm he could discern things better<lb/>
at a miles distance, than the man that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised><lb/>
as good eyes as himself, and yet stood close by<lb/>
the object.<lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
This being so, it must needs be the excellency<lb/>
and great commendation of this Church,<lb/>
that her Articles of Doctrine agree better<lb/>
with the first Times of Christianity than the<lb/>
last Age; and is an irrefragable Argument<lb/>
that she derived it not from any Lake or lower<lb/>
streams troubled and mudded with <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> passions<lb/>
and disputes, but from the Fountain of<lb/>
the holy Scripture, and from those who<lb/>
certainly had best advantage of understanding<lb/>
it in its own simplicity, the Primitive<lb/>
Church. That no one Father or Writer of<lb/>
the Church, whether Greek or Latin, before<lb/>
St. Austin's time agreed in Doctrine with the<lb/>
determination of the Synod of Dort is so notoriously<lb/>
plain that it needs no proof, nor<lb/>
can be <normalised orig="denyed" auto="true">denied</normalised>. And if he (I mean St. Austin)<lb/>
agrees therewith, yet it is certain that<lb/>
in so doing he disagrees as much with himself<lb/>
as he <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> with us of the Church of<lb/>
England. And what if St. Austin, a devout<lb/>
good man, (but whose Piety was far more<lb/>
commendable than his Reason,) being hard<lb/>
put to it by the Manichees on one hand, and<lb/>
the Pelagians on the other, was not able to<lb/>
extricate himself, who can help it? Shall his<lb/>
Opinion, and that which he was rather<lb/>
forced into by disputation than made choice<lb/>
of, but especially shall the Determination<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="7">6</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
of a few Divines at Dort <normalised orig="vye" auto="true">vie</normalised> with the constant<lb/>
Doctrine of the Primitive Church, or<lb/>
make that an imputation upon our Church,<lb/>
which is really amongst its Glories? Must<lb/>
a novel Dutch Synod prescribe Doctrine to<lb/>
the Church of England, and outweigh all<lb/>
Antiquity? Shall those that knew not how<lb/>
God could be just, unless he was cruel, nor<lb/>
great, unless he decreed to damn the greatest<lb/>
part of Mankind; that could not tell how<lb/>
man should be kept humble, unless they made<lb/>
him not a man but a stock or stone: Shall, I<lb/>
say, such Men and such Opinions confront<lb/>
the <normalised orig="Antient" auto="true">Ancient</normalised> <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised> Faith, held<lb/>
forth in the Church of England?<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Secondly, The Articles of the Doctrine<lb/>
of this Church do with such admirable prudence<lb/>
and wariness handle these points we<lb/>
are now speaking of, as if particular respect<lb/>
was had to these men, and care taken that<lb/>
they might abundare suo sensu, enjoy their<lb/>
own Judgements, and yet without check subscribe<lb/>
to these Articles. And accordingly<lb/>
it is well known, that not many years since,<lb/>
when the Dort Opinions were very predominant<lb/>
amongst many Divines of this Church,<lb/>
they used (it may be) a little more <normalised orig="scholastick" auto="true">scholastic</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="subtilty" auto="true">subtlety</normalised> to reconcile their own Opinions<lb/>
with these Articles, but never condemned<lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
the latter for the sake of the former.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
And at this day divers good men are in the<lb/>
service of this Church that are in their private<lb/>
Judgements of the Dort <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised>, and<lb/>
yet never thought their subscription to these<lb/>
Articles did any violence to their Consciences<lb/>
or Judgements: therefore this can be no cause<lb/>
of our Troubles, nor ground of Separation<lb/>
from the Church.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
A second pretence against this Church is,<lb/>
that it is not sufficiently purged from the<lb/>
dross of Popish Superstitions, that it comes<lb/>
too near the Church of Rome, and so the<lb/>
Communion of it is dangerous.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Popery is an odious Name in this Nation,<lb/>
and God be thanked that it is so, for it deserves<lb/>
no less: But as Constantine when he<lb/>
condemned the Arrians and decreed their<lb/>
Books should be burnt, appointed that they<lb/>
should be called Porphyrians, a Name sufficiently<lb/>
detested by the generality of Christians:<lb/>
So those men that have a mind to reproach<lb/>
the Church, know no more effectual<lb/>
way of affixing an Ignominy upon it, than<lb/>
by laying the imputation of Popery to it.<lb/>
And indeed if the Charge were as true as it is<lb/>
false, or if it were as probable as it is malicious,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="9">8</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
it would not only serve to exasperate<lb/>
the Vulgar against the Church, but to <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised><lb/>
their Secession from it. But it is hard to say<lb/>
whether the unreasonableness or the uncharitableness<lb/>
be greater in this suggestion. For,<lb/>
                  <lb/>
1. It is certain there <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been little or<lb/>
no alteration made in either the Doctrine,<lb/>
Discipline or Liturgy since the first Reformation;<lb/>
and therefore if either of them incline<lb/>
too much that way, they did so from the beginning.<lb/>
Now that which I inquire into, is,<lb/>
what should be the causes of the late revolt<lb/>
and separation from this Church, or what<lb/>
should make that <normalised orig="discernable" auto="true">discernible</normalised> change in <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised><lb/>
affections towards it, from what was in the<lb/>
former Age? And he that tells me it was Popishly<lb/>
constituted at first, gives indeed a reason<lb/>
(if it was true) why this Reformation<lb/>
should not have been entertained at first,<lb/>
but <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not assign a cause why those should<lb/>
depart from it now, that had <normalised orig="imbraced" auto="true">embraced</normalised> it<lb/>
with so much zeal formerly. He therefore<lb/>
that would speak home to this case, must<lb/>
<normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> that this Church <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> lost its first love,<lb/>
and <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> warped towards the old corruptions<lb/>
from which it was once purged. But<lb/>
this is so far from being possible to be <normalised orig="shewn" auto="true">shown</normalised>,<lb/>
that it is certain on the contrary, that all the<lb/>
change that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been made of late years,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="10">9</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been <normalised orig="meerly" auto="true">merely</normalised> in <normalised orig="complyance" auto="true">compliance</normalised> with and<lb/>
condescension to those that object this against<lb/>
it; and a man would reasonably expect, they<lb/>
would easily pardon such Innovations.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
But in truth the main quarrel is, that<lb/>
we are not <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> reforming, but keep to<lb/>
the old Matron-like Dress, the <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>Q*<normalised orig="een" auto="true">even</normalised></sic>
                     <corr>Queen</corr>
                  </choice> Elizabeth<lb/>
fashion. If the <normalised orig="Governours" auto="true">Governors</normalised> of the<lb/>
Church would comply with the curiosity of<lb/>
this wanton Age, our Religion would quickly<lb/>
have the fortune of Apelles's picture according<lb/>
to the known story. He to deride the<lb/>
conceited folly of the Age, exposes to <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised><lb/>
view a Master-piece of his work: And<lb/>
as it usually happens, that every body pretends<lb/>
to skill in reforming (by the <normalised orig="incouragement" auto="true">encouragement</normalised><lb/>
of the Proverb that saith, facile<lb/>
est inventis <normalised orig="addere" auto="true">adder</normalised>) scarcely any person<lb/>
that past by, but spent their verdict upon the<lb/>
picture; All commend it in the general, yet<lb/>
to give some special instance of their skill,<lb/>
every one finds some fault or other: One<lb/>
would have had more Shadow, another less;<lb/>
one commends the Eye, but blames a Lip, &amp;c.<lb/>
The <normalised orig="subtil" auto="true">subtle</normalised> Artist observes all, and still as<lb/>
any passenger had shot his bolt, alters the picture<lb/>
accordingly. The result was, that at<lb/>
last by so many Reformations it became so<lb/>
deformed and monstrous a piece, that not<lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
only wiser men, but these vulgar Reformers<lb/>
themselves wondered at it, and could now<lb/>
discern nothing worthy so famed an Artist.<lb/>
He on the other hand, to right himself, produces<lb/>
another Piece of the same Beauty and<lb/>
Art, which he had hitherto kept up by him,<lb/>
and had escaped their censure, and upbraids<lb/>
them thus, Hanc ego feci, istam populus,<lb/>
This latter is my work, the other is a monster<lb/>
of your own making.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
This is our case; Christian Religion was<lb/>
by holy and wise men our Reformers, <normalised orig="devested" auto="true">divested</normalised><lb/>
of those gaudy and meretricious <normalised orig="accoutrements" auto="false">accouterments</normalised><lb/>
the Romanists had <normalised orig="drest" auto="true">dressed</normalised> her up<lb/>
in, and habited according to primitive simplicity;<lb/>
but this would not please every body,<lb/>
every Sect and Party would have something<lb/>
or other added or altered according to<lb/>
their several <normalised orig="phancies" auto="true">fancies</normalised> and Hypotheses, which<lb/>
if it should be allowed (the opinions of men<lb/>
are so contrary one to another as well as to<lb/>
truth) the true lineaments of Christianity<lb/>
would quite be lost. Upon this consideration<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not this Church been very fond<lb/>
of alterations.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
But to all this it is likely it will be <normalised orig="replyed" auto="true">replied</normalised>,<lb/>
That now we have more light and discover<lb/>
blemishes and deformities, which (though<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="12">D</fw>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
they were before, yet) we could not discern<lb/>
when our selves came out of the dark Den of<lb/>
Popery. At first, like the man under cure of<lb/>
his blindness, Mark 8. 24. we saw men as<lb/>
trees walking, we discovered only some more<lb/>
palpable errors, but now we discern though<lb/>
lesser yet not tolerable deformities.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
2. To this therefore I answer in the second<lb/>
place, That it is certain all is not to be esteemed<lb/>
Popery, that is held or practised by the<lb/>
Church of Rome, and it cannot be our duty<lb/>
(as I have said before) to depart further from<lb/>
her than she <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> departed from the truth:<lb/>
for then it would be our duty to forsake<lb/>
Christianity it self in detestation of Popery.<lb/>
To reform is not surely to cast away every<lb/>
thing that was in use before, unless Barbarism<lb/>
be the only through Reformation.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
The Historian observes of those that spoil<lb/>
Provinces and ransack Kingdoms ubi solitudinem<lb/>
fecere pacem appellant, when they had<lb/>
converted a flourishing <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised> into a desolate<lb/>
wilderness, they called this a profound<lb/>
peace. But sure to reform is not to destroy<lb/>
and lay waste, but to amend. Unless therefore<lb/>
it can be proved against the Church of<lb/>
England that she holds or practises any thing<lb/>
false or sinful, it will little avail them that<lb/>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
object against her, and as little be any blemish<lb/>
to her constitution, that in some things<lb/>
she concurs with the Roman. Nor is it reasonable<lb/>
to say, such a thing is received from<lb/>
the Church of Rome, <normalised orig="meerly" auto="true">merely</normalised> because there it<lb/>
is to be found, unless it be to be found no<lb/>
where else: for though it be true that many<lb/>
things are the same in both Churches, (in as<lb/>
much as it is impossible they should be Churches<lb/>
of Christ at all else,) yet it is as true that<lb/>
those things wherein they agree are such (and<lb/>
no other) as were received generally by all<lb/>
Christian Churches, and by the Roman before<lb/>
it lay under any ill character. But that<lb/>
this Church <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not so syncretize with that<lb/>
of Rome, as to make its Communion unsafe<lb/>
or sinful, I suppose the following Considerations<lb/>
will give sufficient security to an unprejudiced<lb/>
mind. In the mean time let me<lb/>
<normalised orig="intreat" auto="true">entreat</normalised> him that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> entertained any suspicions<lb/>
of that kind against her, to give an ingenuous<lb/>
Answer of these two or three Queries.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
1. If there be such a dangerous affinity<lb/>
betwixt the Church of England and the <normalised orig="Romish" auto="true">Roman</normalised>,<lb/>
how came it to pass that the blessed instruments<lb/>
of our Reformation, such as A.<lb/>
Bishop Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer and others,<lb/>
laid down their lives in testimony to this<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="14">D2</fw>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
against that? For if those of the Church of<lb/>
Rome could have been so barbarous as cruelly<lb/>
to murder those excellent persons for some<lb/>
slight Innovations, or for differing from them<lb/>
in Circumstantials; yet certainly such wise<lb/>
and good men would not have been so prodigal<lb/>
of their own blood, nor weary of their<lb/>
lives as to cast them away upon Trifles. It<lb/>
is probable at least therefore that those of the<lb/>
Church of Rome thought the English Reformation<lb/>
to be essentially different from them;<lb/>
and it is more than probable that those holy<lb/>
men aforesaid thought so, and did not offer<lb/>
to God the sacrifice of fools.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
2. Or how comes it to pass that all those<lb/>
of the Roman Communion withdraw themselves<lb/>
from ours, and are commanded so to<lb/>
do by the Head of their Church under peril<lb/>
of damnation? And on the other side the<lb/>
true Protestants of the Church of England,<lb/>
think it their duty to absent themselves from<lb/>
the Roman Worship, lest they should defile<lb/>
their Consciences with their Superstitions?<lb/>
I say how comes this distance and apprehension<lb/>
of sin and danger reciprocally, if the differences<lb/>
between them be inconsiderable?<lb/>
                  <lb/>
3. Whence comes it to pass, that the Bigots<lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Romish" auto="true">Roman</normalised> Church have more spite<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="15">14</fw>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
against our Church, than against any Sect or<lb/>
Party whatsoever? but that they take us not<lb/>
only for Enemies, but the most mortal and<lb/>
formidable of all those they have to do<lb/>
with.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Or Lastly, if both the Church and Church-men<lb/>
of England are not far enough removed<lb/>
from any participation with that of Rome,<lb/>
how comes it to pass that they of all men<lb/>
most zealously and constantly upon all occasions<lb/>
stand in the gap and oppose the return of<lb/>
Popery into England, when other men either<lb/>
slight the danger, or are so fond of their own<lb/>
private sentiments, as apparently to run the<lb/>
hazard of this for the sake of them? Any<lb/>
reasonable man would think those men have<lb/>
not really such an abhorrence of Popery as<lb/>
they pretend, and that there might easily be<lb/>
found terms of accommodation between them,<lb/>
when he shall observe them more fond of every<lb/>
petty Opinion, than <normalised orig="concern'd" auto="true">concerned</normalised> for the<lb/>
<normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Security against that common Enemy;<lb/>
And that they will rather venture the<lb/>
danger of that breaking in upon them, than<lb/>
forgo the least fancy or opinion; nay, will<lb/>
be instrumental in procuring a Toleration<lb/>
and suspension of the <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Laws for that,<lb/>
which they are so jealous others should have<lb/>
any kindness for. And for proof of this, I<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="16">D3</fw>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
call to witness the transactions of the last<lb/>
year, when those very men that would be<lb/>
thought the Atlas's and only supporters of<lb/>
Protestant Religion, and would give out as if<lb/>
their Zeal was the only Bulwark against Popery,<lb/>
had by their separation from, and enmity<lb/>
to this Church, <normalised orig="weakned" auto="true">weakened</normalised> the common interest,<lb/>
and by their restless importunities and<lb/>
unlimited desires of liberty, in a manner extorted<lb/>
a suspension of the Laws touching<lb/>
Religion. Had not His Majesty and His<lb/>
Parliament timely foreseen the consequence,<lb/>
and the whole Nation been <normalised orig="awakned" auto="true">awakened</normalised> into an<lb/>
apprehension of the danger by the serious<lb/>
and constant admonitions of the Episcopal<lb/>
Clergy, Popery might have come in like a<lb/>
Landflood upon us, notwithstanding those<lb/>
quicksighted Watchmen that can spy Popery<lb/>
so far off. I say had not the Church-men<lb/>
especially bestirred themselves, and <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised><lb/>
both a better courage and zeal against Popery,<lb/>
and also a better skill in that warfare<lb/>
than their Accusers, the so much dreaded<lb/>
Enemy had ere this time been in fair hopes<lb/>
of attaining his desires.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
This was a passage of so much glory to<lb/>
the true Church-men, and so great and illustrious<lb/>
an instance of their integrity, that I<lb/>
am in hope <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> it shall remain in memory,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="17">16</fw>
                  <pb n="16"/>
                  <lb/>
Malice it self will be ashamed to lay any imputation<lb/>
of inclining to Popery either upon<lb/>
the Church or Church-men of England.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
I shall not need to add to all this, That there<lb/>
are as understanding men in Religion, persons<lb/>
of as holy Lives, and of as comfortable<lb/>
Consciences, of this Churches Education, as<lb/>
are any where to be found in the world besides.<lb/>
Which three things together fully<lb/>
acquit any Church of participation with<lb/>
Popery. For that degeneracy of Christianity<lb/>
is for nothing more truly hateful, nor by<lb/>
nothing more discoverable than by its blind<lb/>
devotion, principles of immorality, and the<lb/>
<normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> security it gives to the Consciences of<lb/>
men; which who so acquits any Church of,<lb/>
(as every considerate man must needs do<lb/>
this Church) he shall after that, very unreasonably<lb/>
leave any ill character upon her, at<lb/>
least of that nature we now are speaking of.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
3. But there is a terrible Charge yet to<lb/>
come, and that is against the Sufficiency, but<lb/>
especially the Sanctity of the Clergy and<lb/>
Ministry of the Church of England; as if<lb/>
they, like the Sons of Eli, 1 Sam. 2. 15. <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Sam 2.17">made<lb/>
men to abhor the offerings of the Lord.</quote> And<lb/>
this is made the pretence of resorting to Conventicles,<lb/>
and forsaking the Church.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="18">D4</fw>
                  <pb n="17"/>
                  <lb/>
Now if this was as true as it is horribly<lb/>
false, it might be an Objection perhaps fit<lb/>
for a Papist to make, who is taught that the<lb/>
efficacy of all Divine Offices depends upon<lb/>
the intention and condition of him that administers;<lb/>
But no Protestant without contradicting<lb/>
his own principles can make use<lb/>
of it to <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> his recession from the Church:<lb/>
For if the efficacy of all Divine Ordinances<lb/>
depend upon the Divine Institution and the<lb/>
concurrence of Gods Grace with my use of<lb/>
them, what can it prejudice me, that he that<lb/>
administers is an evil or unlearned man, so<lb/>
long as I prepare my self to receive benefit<lb/>
immediately from God in the use of the<lb/>
means appointed by him? This therefore<lb/>
may serve for a malicious stone to cast at<lb/>
us from whom they are departed; but no<lb/>
argument in the cause, nor excuse for themselves.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Yet I confess nevertheless, this way of<lb/>
arguing (for we must be forced to call hard<lb/>
words by that name) is of great prevalence<lb/>
with injudicious persons, and able to prejudice<lb/>
them against the best Constitutions in<lb/>
the world. For they not understanding the<lb/>
reason of things, give reception and entertainment<lb/>
to any proposition in proportion to<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="19">18</fw>
                  <pb n="18"/>
                  <lb/>
the opinion or reverence they have for the<lb/>
person that recommends it. It is a known<lb/>
story, how well the Spartans were aware of<lb/>
this; and therefore if in their Council, a<lb/>
man of a <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> life had propounded excellent<lb/>
counsel, they would not suffer him, but suborn<lb/>
some other person of great sanctity to<lb/>
be the Author of it: Amongst other reasons,<lb/>
lest the ill opinion that was generally conceived<lb/>
of the person, should derogate from<lb/>
the weight and value of the counsel and<lb/>
advice.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Therefore the more <normalised orig="extreamly" auto="true">extremely</normalised> to blame<lb/>
are those that acknowledging the truth and<lb/>
excellency of the Doctrine of the Church of<lb/>
England, can yet find in their hearts to undermine<lb/>
the success of it by sowing suspicions<lb/>
and in raising scandals against them, that<lb/>
are to propagate it.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
It will be to the immortal glory of the<lb/>
Great Constantine, that when at the Nicene<lb/>
Council the Bishops and Clergy had exhibited<lb/>
to him a great bundle of Libels one<lb/>
against another, he burnt them all together<lb/>
before their faces, as thinking them fitter<lb/>
for the fire than the light. And protested<lb/>
he had so great a zeal for the reputation of<lb/>
Church-men, and such a sense of the concern<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="20">19</fw>
                  <pb n="19"/>
                  <lb/>
and consequence of their good fame and<lb/>
reputation, that if he should see one of them<lb/>
in the most scandalous commission, he would<lb/>
cover such a mans shame with his own<lb/>
Purple.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
But as I doubt in these <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> there is little<lb/>
of the Spirit and Charity of Constantine, so<lb/>
thanks be to God, there is little need of it<lb/>
in this case; for I doubt not to convince this<lb/>
suggestion against the Church-men of as<lb/>
much <normalised orig="falshood" auto="true">falsehood</normalised>, as the former against the<lb/>
Church of frivolousness. For though there<lb/>
want not those in these <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> that are so<lb/>
quick-sighted as to discover spots in the Sun<lb/>
it self: Though I say, there be both those<lb/>
that have great skill in all the methods of<lb/>
uncharitableness, such as can insinuate little<lb/>
whispers and jealousies first, and then foment<lb/>
and hatch them up to a story, and then aggravate<lb/>
the fact, and lastly make the folly<lb/>
of some one man, be the scandal of the whole<lb/>
Order; And also those Atheistical persons<lb/>
whose interest it is (in order to the extenuating<lb/>
their own <normalised orig="villanies" auto="true">villainies</normalised>,) as much as may<lb/>
be to render the persons of those that reprove<lb/>
them as ridiculous as they can, and to that<lb/>
purpose are become great proficients of late<lb/>
in a scurrilous kind of drollery, whereby<lb/>
they can sublimate their own vices and debaucheries<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="21">20</fw>
                  <pb n="20"/>
                  <lb/>
into a kind of vapour, a <normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="frolick" auto="true">frolic</normalised> and Gentile humour, and on the other<lb/>
side aggravate the <normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> humane infirmities of<lb/>
graver men into great deformities: yet all<lb/>
their combined wit and malice will never<lb/>
be able to affix any scandal upon the Body of<lb/>
the present English Clergy.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
1. For their Learning and Ability: If the<lb/>
Preaching of the present Age be not better<lb/>
than that of former, I would fain know the<lb/>
reason why the Homilies are in no greater<lb/>
reputation, and should expect to see the<lb/>
people desire their Pastors to read them in<lb/>
the Congregation, and save the labour of<lb/>
their own compositions.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
If the Sermons of foreign Divines be better<lb/>
than those of the English, what is then<lb/>
the reason that all Protestants abroad admire<lb/>
the English way of Preaching, <normalised orig="insomuch" auto="true">inasmuch</normalised> that<lb/>
some foreign Congregations (as I am credibly<lb/>
informed) defray the charges of the<lb/>
travails of their Pastor into England, as well<lb/>
as dispense with their absence, that they may<lb/>
return to them instructed in the method of<lb/>
English Preaching.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Whether the Preaching in the Church of<lb/>
Rome be to be preferred before ours, he that<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="22">21</fw>
                  <pb n="21"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not a mind to travail into those parts,<lb/>
may yet indifferently well resolve himself, if<lb/>
he take but the pains to read a Book written<lb/>
by Erasmus of the Art of Preaching: which<lb/>
whosoever <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> done or shall do, I verily<lb/>
<normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> my self, he shall quickly be able<lb/>
to reckon up more follies and ridiculous passages,<lb/>
than all those gathered together by<lb/>
the Author of the Inquiry into the Causes of<lb/>
the Contempt of the Clergy.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Lastly, He that shall take the pains or<lb/>
have the curiosity to compare the Preachings<lb/>
generally in our Churches with those ordinarily<lb/>
in the Conventicles, will either find<lb/>
them very unequally <normalised orig="matcht" auto="true">matched</normalised>, or else if he<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> any reason at all, he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> reason to suspect<lb/>
himself intolerably prejudicate. For<lb/>
on the one side, he shall find sound Theology,<lb/>
strength of Argument, gravity of Expression<lb/>
and distinctness of Method; on the other<lb/>
side nothing more frequent than puerile and<lb/>
flat, oft-times rude, and sometimes blasphemous<lb/>
expressions, Similitudes instead of<lb/>
Arguments, and either apish Gestures, or<lb/>
tragical Vociferations instead of Eloquence.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Besides, a wise man may in great measure<lb/>
take an estimate of the wisdom and abilities<lb/>
of a Preacher or Writer by the very subject<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="23">22</fw>
                  <pb n="22"/>
                  <lb/>
he chooses to discourse on, and not only by the<lb/>
manner of handling it. And he that shall<lb/>
impartially apply himself to this little trouble,<lb/>
may easily observe the Sermons and<lb/>
Tractates of the Non-conformists generally,<lb/>
to be either about Predestination, which<lb/>
(besides the danger of it amongst the people<lb/>
for mistakes) nothing but unskilfulness could<lb/>
make any man confident enough to undertake<lb/>
the unfolding of; or about Union with<lb/>
God and Christ, which themselves confess to<lb/>
be unintelligible, and they help to make it<lb/>
so; or the sweetness, beauty and loveliness<lb/>
of Christ's Person, which is <normalised orig="seldome" auto="true">seldom</normalised> handled<lb/>
with any better effect, than the stirring<lb/>
up some sensual passion or other in the fond<lb/>
Auditors, as I have seen verified by experience.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
God forbid that I should charge all the<lb/>
Non-conformists with such indecencies as<lb/>
these; but it is manifest it is such kind of<lb/>
discourses as I have intimated, that are the<lb/>
most taking and ravishing amongst them.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
But then on the other side, you shall hear<lb/>
Discourses of the Nature and Attributes of<lb/>
God, and the reason of Religion deduced<lb/>
thence; of the Divine Providence, and Arguments<lb/>
of Contentment, Reverence and Submission<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="24">23</fw>
                  <pb n="23"/>
                  <lb/>
inferred therefrom; of the Eternal<lb/>
reasons of Good and Evil, and indispensable<lb/>
obligations to Virtue, as the consequence of<lb/>
that principle laid upon the Consciences of<lb/>
men; of the nature of Faith, the necessity<lb/>
of Holiness, of Charity, of Obedience to <normalised orig="Governours" auto="true">Governors</normalised>:<lb/>
all which are good and profitable,<lb/>
and of great weight and importance.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
If we now compare the Writings of both<lb/>
parties, the difference will yet be more legible.<lb/>
Although it <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been observed of<lb/>
old by a Wise and Great man, That generally<lb/>
the ablest of men have not been most given<lb/>
to writing of Books, as being <normalised orig="loth" auto="true">loath</normalised> to make<lb/>
themselves Themes for fools to comment upon;<lb/>
but a middle sort of men are most disposed,<lb/>
and usually have best success that<lb/>
way, whose Genius is more adequate to vulgar<lb/>
capacities: yet let any man of competent<lb/>
judgement lay passion and prejudice aside,<lb/>
and say, if the Writings of the Divines of<lb/>
this Church, both in the Controversies of Religion<lb/>
and most other parts of Learning,<lb/>
have not <normalised orig="matcht" auto="true">matched</normalised> any other Profession, any<lb/>
other Church, but <normalised orig="extreamly" auto="true">extremely</normalised> <normalised orig="overmatcht" auto="false">overmatched</normalised><lb/>
their Opponents? It were <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> to name Men<lb/>
and Writings, but I conceive it needless in so<lb/>
clear a case.<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="25">24</fw>
                  <pb n="24"/>
                  <lb/>
2. But then for the lives of Church-men;<lb/>
Though I will not render evil for evil, nor<lb/>
retaliate the reproaches cast upon the Sons of<lb/>
the Church, by ripping up the miscarriages<lb/>
of the other <normalised orig="perswasions" auto="true">persuasions</normalised>: For (besides that<lb/>
I have not so learned Christ,) I have observed<lb/>
so much of the world, that such uncharitable<lb/>
recriminations have not only made an<lb/>
Apology for the Atheism and Profaneness of<lb/>
the Age, but afford a pleasant spectacle to all<lb/>
evil men, to behold Divines coming upon<lb/>
the Stage like Gladiators, and wounding and<lb/>
murdering one <normalised orig="anothers" auto="true">another</normalised> reputation. To<lb/>
which add, that I verily hope the Lives, of<lb/>
the generality at least, of the Clergy of<lb/>
England are so unblameable and commendable<lb/>
in themselves, that they need not the foil<lb/>
of other <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> deformities to set them off or<lb/>
recommend them.<lb/>
