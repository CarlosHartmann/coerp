                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
I will mention but one Testimony more of this Father,<lb/>
but so clear a one as it is impossible any man in his<lb/>
wits that had believed Transubstantiation could have<lb/>
<normalised orig="utter'd" auto="true">uttered</normalised>. It is in his Treatise de Doctrina Christiana;<lb/>
where laying down several Rules for the right understanding<lb/>
of Scripture, he gives this for one. If (says<lb/>
he) the speech be a precept forbidding some heinous wickedness<lb/>
or crime, or commanding us to do good, it is not<lb/>
figurative; but if it seem to command any heinous wickedness<lb/>
or crime, or to forbid that which is profitable and<lb/>
beneficial to others, it is figurative. For example, <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 6.53">Except<lb/>
<normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>,<lb/>
<normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> have no life in you</quote>: This seems to command a heinous<lb/>
wickedness and crime, therefore it is a figure; commanding<lb/>
us to communicate of the passion of our Lord, and<lb/>
with delight and advantage to lay up in our memory that<lb/>
his flesh was crucified and wounded for us. So that, according<lb/>
to St. Austin's best skill in interpreting Scripture,<lb/>
the literal eating of the flesh of Christ and drinking<lb/>
his <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> would have been a great impiety; and<lb/>
therefore the expression is to be understood figuratively;<lb/>
not as Cardinal Perron would have it, <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> in<lb/>
opposition to the eating of his flesh and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> in the<lb/>
gross appearance of flesh and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>, but to the real<lb/>
eating of his natural body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> under any appearance<lb/>
whatsoever: For St. Austin <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not say, this is<lb/>
a Figurative speech wherein we are commanded really<lb/>
to feed upon the natural body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of Christ under<lb/>
the species of bread and wine, as the Cardinal<lb/>
would understand him; for then the speech would be<lb/>
literal and not figurative: But he says, this is a figurative<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="18">C2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
speech wherein we are commanded Spiritually<lb/>
to feed upon the remembrance of his Passion.<lb/>
To these I will add but three or four Testimonies<lb/>
more in the two following Ages.<lb/>
The first shall be of Theodoret, who speaking of that<lb/>
Prophecy of Jacob concerning our Saviour, <quote type="biblical" ana="Gen 49.11">he washed<lb/>
his garments in Wine and his clothes in the <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of<lb/>
grapes,</quote>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> these words, as we call the mystical fruit<lb/>
of the Vine (that is, the Wine in the Sacrament) after<lb/>
consecration the <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of the Lord, so he (viz. Jacob)<lb/>
calls the <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of the true Vine (viz. of Christ) the<lb/>
<normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of the grape: but the <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of Christ is not literally<lb/>
and properly but <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> figuratively the <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of<lb/>
the grape, in the same sense as he is said to be the true<lb/>
Vine; and therefore the Wine in the Sacrament after<lb/>
consecration is in like manner not literally and properly<lb/>
but figuratively the <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of Christ. And he explains<lb/>
this afterwards, saying, that our Saviour changed<lb/>
the names, and gave to his Body the name of the Symbol<lb/>
or Sign, and to the Symbol or Sign the name of his Body;<lb/>
thus when he had <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> himself the Vine, he <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> the<lb/>
Symbol or Sign his <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>; so that in the same sense that<lb/>
he <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> himself the Vine, he <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> the Wine, which<lb/>
is the Symbol of his <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>, his <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>: For, says he,<lb/>
he would have those who partake of the divine mysteries<lb/>
not to attend to the nature of the things which are seen,<lb/>
but by the change of names to believe the change which is<lb/>
made by grace; for he who <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> that which by nature is<lb/>
a body wheat and bread, and again likewise <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> himself<lb/>
the Vine, he <normalised orig="honour'd" auto="true">honoured</normalised> the Symbols with the name of his<lb/>
body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>: not changing nature but adding grace to<lb/>
nature. Where you see he says <normalised orig="expresly" auto="true">expressly</normalised>, that when he<lb/>
<normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> the Symbols or Elements of the Sacrament, viz.<lb/>
bread and Wine, his Body and <normalised orig="Bloud" auto="true">Blood</normalised>, he made no change<lb/>
in the nature of the things, <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> added grace to nature,<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
that is, by the Divine grace and blessing he raised<lb/>
them to a Spiritual and Supernatural <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> and<lb/>
efficacy.<lb/>
The Second is of the same Theodoret in his second Dialogue<lb/>
between a <normalised orig="Catholique" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> under the name of Orthodoxus,<lb/>
and an <normalised orig="Heretique" auto="true">Heretic</normalised> under the name of Eranistes;<lb/>
who maintaining that the Humanity of Christ was<lb/>
<normalised orig="chang'd" auto="true">changed</normalised> into the substance of the Divinity (which was<lb/>
the <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised> of Eutyches) he illustrates the matter by<lb/>
this <normalised orig="Similitude" auto="true">Simulated</normalised>, As, says he, the Symbols of the Lord's<lb/>
body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> are one thing before the invocation of the<lb/>
Priest, but after the invocation are changed and become<lb/>
another thing; So the body of our Lord after his ascension<lb/>
is changed into the divine substance. But what says the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Catholique" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Orthodoxus to this? why, he talks just like<lb/>
one of Cardinal Perron's <normalised orig="Heretiques" auto="true">Heretics</normalised>, Thou art, says he,<lb/>
caught in thy own net: because the mystical Symbols after<lb/>
consecration do not pass out of their own nature; for they<lb/>
remain in their former substance, figure and appearance<lb/>
and may be seen and handled even as before. He does<lb/>
not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> deny the outward figure and appearance of<lb/>
the Symbols to be <normalised orig="chang'd" auto="true">changed</normalised>, but the nature and substance<lb/>
of them, even in the proper and strictest sense<lb/>
of the word substance; and it was necessary so to do,<lb/>
otherwise he had not given a pertinent answer to the<lb/>
<normalised orig="similitude" auto="true">simulated</normalised> <normalised orig="urg'd" auto="true">urged</normalised> against him.<lb/>
The next is one of their own Popes, Gelasius, who<lb/>
brings the same Instance against the Eutychians; surely,<lb/>
says he, the Sacraments which we receive of the body<lb/>
and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of our Lord are a divine thing, so that by<lb/>
them we are made partakers of a divine nature, and yet<lb/>
it <normalised orig="ceaseth" auto="true">cease</normalised> not to be the substance or nature of bread and<lb/>
Wine; and certainly the image and resemblance of Christ's<lb/>
body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> are celebrated in the action of the mysteries,<lb/>
that is, in the Sacrament. To make this Instance<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="20">19</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
of any force against the Eutychians, who held<lb/>
that the body of Christ upon his ascension <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*a*'d</sic>
                     <corr><normalised orig="ceas'd" auto="true">ceased</normalised></corr>
                  </choice> and<lb/>
was <normalised orig="chang'd" auto="true">changed</normalised> into the substance of his Divinity, it was<lb/>
necessary to deny that there was any substantial<lb/>
change in the Sacrament of the bread and wine into<lb/>
the body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of Christ. So that here is an infallible<lb/>
authority, one of their own Popes <normalised orig="expresly" auto="true">expressly</normalised> against<lb/>
Transubstantiation.<lb/>
The last Testimony I shall produce is of Facundus an<lb/>
African Bishop, who lived in the 6th. Century. Upon<lb/>
occasion of justifying an expression of one who had<lb/>
said that Christ also received the adoption of Sons, he<lb/>
reasons thus. Christ vouchsafed to receive the Sacrament<lb/>
of adoption both when he was circumcised and <normalised orig="baptized" auto="true">baptised</normalised>:<lb/>
And the Sacrament of Adoption may be called<lb/>
adoption, as the Sacrament of his body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>, which<lb/>
is in the consecrated bread and cup, is by us called his body<lb/>
and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>: not that the bread, says he, is properly<lb/>
his body and the cup his <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>, but because they contain<lb/>
in them the mysteries of his body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>; hence also<lb/>
our Lord himself called the blessed bread and cup which<lb/>
he gave to his Disciples his body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>. Can any<lb/>
man after this believe, that it was then, and had ever<lb/>
been, the universal and received Doctrine of the<lb/>
Christian Church, that the bread and wine in the Sacrament<lb/>
are substantially changed into the proper and<lb/>
natural body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of Christ?<lb/>
By these plain Testimonies which I have produced,<lb/>
and I might have brought a great many more to the<lb/>
same purpose, it is I think evident beyond all denial<lb/>
that Transubstantiation <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not been the perpetual belief<lb/>
of the Christian Church. And this likewise is acknowledged<lb/>
by many great and learned men of the<lb/>
Roman Church. Scotus <normalised orig="acknowledgeth" auto="true">acknowledges</normalised>, that this<lb/>
Doctrine was not always thought necessary to be believed,<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
but that the necessity of believing it was consequent<lb/>
to that Declaration of the Church made in the<lb/>
Council of Lateran under Pope Innocent the III. And<lb/>
Durandus freely discovers his inclination to have<lb/>
believed the contrary, if the Church had not by that determination<lb/>
obliged men to believe it. Tonstal Bishop<lb/>
of Durham also yields, that before the Lateran<lb/>
Council men were at liberty as to the manner of Christ's<lb/>
presence in the Sacrament. And Erasmus, who lived<lb/>
and died in the communion of the Roman Church,<lb/>
and than whom no man was better read in the ancient<lb/>
Fathers, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> confess that it was late before the Church<lb/>
defined Transubstantiation, unknown to the Ancients both<lb/>
name and thing. And Alphonsus a Castro says plainly,<lb/>
that concerning the Transubstantiation of the bread<lb/>
into the body of Christ, there is seldom any mention in<lb/>
the ancient Writers. And who can imagine that these<lb/>
learned men would have granted the ancient Church<lb/>
and Fathers to have been so much Strangers to this<lb/>
Doctrine, had they thought it to have been the perpetual<lb/>
belief of the Church? I shall now in the<lb/>
Second place, give an account of the particular time<lb/>
and occasion of the coming in of this Doctrine, and by what<lb/>
steps and degrees it grew up and was advanced into<lb/>
an Article of Faith in the <normalised orig="Romish" auto="true">Roman</normalised> Church. The Doctrine<lb/>
of the corporal presence of Christ was first started upon<lb/>
occasion of the Dispute about the Worship of Images,<lb/>
in opposition whereto the Synod of Constantinople about<lb/>
the year DCCL did argue thus, That our Lord having<lb/>
left us no other image of himself but the Sacrament,<lb/>
in which the substance of bread is the image of<lb/>
his body, we ought to make no other image of our<lb/>
Lord. In answer to this Argument the second Council<lb/>
of Nice in the year DCCLXXXVII did declare, that<lb/>
the Sacrament after Consecration is not the image and<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="22">21</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
antitype of Christ's body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>, but is properly his<lb/>
body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>. So that the corporal presence of Christ<lb/>
in the Sacrament was first brought in to support the stupid<lb/>
worship of Images: And indeed it could never have<lb/>
come in upon a more proper occasion, nor have been<lb/>
applied to a fitter purpose.<lb/>
And here I cannot but take notice how well this<lb/>
agrees with Bellarmine's Observation, that none of the<lb/>
Ancients who wrote of Heresies, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> put this <normalised orig="errour" auto="true">error</normalised><lb/>
(viz. of denying Transubstantiation) in his Catalogue;<lb/>
nor did any of the Ancients dispute against this <normalised orig="errour" auto="true">error</normalised><lb/>
for the first 600 years. Which is very true, because<lb/>
there could be no occasion then to dispute against those<lb/>
who denied Transubstantiation; since, as I have <normalised orig="shewn" auto="true">shown</normalised>,<lb/>
this Doctrine was not in being, unless amongst the<lb/>
Eutychian <normalised orig="Heretiques" auto="true">Heretics</normalised>, for the first 600 years and more.<lb/>
But Bellarmine goes on and tells us, that the first who<lb/>
<normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> in question the truth of the body of the Lord in the<lb/>
Eucharist were the ICONOMACHI (the opposers of<lb/>
Images) after the year DCC in the Council of Constantinople;<lb/>
for these said there was one image of Christ instituted<lb/>
by Christ himself, viz. the bread and wine in the<lb/>
Eucharist, which represents the body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of Christ:<lb/>
Wherefore from that time the Greek Writers often admonish<lb/>
us that the Eucharist is not the figure or image of<lb/>
the body of the Lord, but his true body, as appears from<lb/>
the VIIth. Synod; which agrees most exactly with the<lb/>
account which I have given of the first rise of this<lb/>
Doctrine, which began with the corporal presence of<lb/>
Christ in the Sacrament, and afterwards proceeded to<lb/>
Transubstantiation.<lb/>
And as this was the first occasion of introducing<lb/>
this Doctrine among the Greeks, so in the Latin or<lb/>
Roman Church Paschasius Radbertus, first a Monk, and<lb/>
afterwards Abbat of Corbey, was the first broacher of it<lb/>
in the year DCCCXVIII.<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="23">22</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
And for this, besides the Evidence of History, we<lb/>
have the acknowledgment of two very Eminent Persons<lb/>
in the Church of Rome, Bellarmine and Sirmondus,<lb/>
who do in effect confess that this Paschasius was the first<lb/>
who wrote to purpose upon this Argument. Bellarmine<lb/>
in these words, This <normalised orig="Authour" auto="true">Author</normalised> was the first who<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> seriously and copiously written concerning the truth<lb/>
of Christ's body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> in the Eucharist: And Sirmondus<lb/>
in these, he so first explained the genuine sense<lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Catholique" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, that he opened the way to the<lb/>
rest who afterwards in great numbers wrote upon the same<lb/>
Argument: But though Sirmondus is pleased to say that<lb/>
he <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> first <normalised orig="explain'd" auto="true">explained</normalised> the sense of the <normalised orig="Catholique" auto="true">Catholic</normalised><lb/>
Church in this Point, yet it is very plain from the Records<lb/>
of that Age which are left to us, that this was the<lb/>
first time that this Doctrine was broached in the Latin<lb/>
Church; and it met with great opposition in that Age,<lb/>
as I shall have occasion hereafter to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised>. For Rabanus<lb/>
Maurus Arch-Bishop of Mentz about the year<lb/>
DCCCXLVII reciting the very words of Paschasius<lb/>
wherein he had <normalised orig="deliver'd" auto="true">delivered</normalised> this Doctrine, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> this remarkable<lb/>
passage concerning the novelty of it; Some,<lb/>
says he, of late, not having a right opinion concerning<lb/>
the Sacrament of the body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of our Lord, have<lb/>
said that this is the body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of our Lord which was<lb/>
born of the Virgin Mary, and in which our Lord suffered<lb/>
upon the Cross and rose from the dead: which <normalised orig="errour" auto="true">error</normalised>,<lb/>
says he, we have <normalised orig="oppos'd" auto="true">opposed</normalised> with all our might. From<lb/>
whence it is plain, by the Testimony of one of the<lb/>
greatest and most learned Bishops of that Age, and of<lb/>
eminent reputation for Piety, that what is now the<lb/>
very Doctrine of the Church of Rome concerning the<lb/>
Sacrament, was then <normalised orig="esteem'd" auto="true">esteemed</normalised> an <normalised orig="Errour" auto="true">Error</normalised> <normalised orig="broach'd" auto="true">broached</normalised> by<lb/>
some particular Persons, but was far from being the<lb/>
generally <normalised orig="receiv'd" auto="true">received</normalised> Doctrine of that Age. Can any<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="24">D</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
one think it possible, that so eminent a Person in the<lb/>
Church both for piety and learning, could have <normalised orig="condemn'd" auto="true">condemned</normalised><lb/>
this Doctrine as an <normalised orig="Errour" auto="true">Error</normalised> and a Novelty, had<lb/>
it been the general Doctrine of the Christian Church,<lb/>
not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> in that but in all former Ages; and no censure<lb/>
<normalised orig="pass'd" auto="true">passed</normalised> upon him for that which is now the great<lb/>
burning Article in the Church of Rome, and esteemed by<lb/>
them one of the greatest and most pernicious Heresies?<lb/>
Afterwards in the ear MLIX, when Berengarius<lb/>
in France and Germany had <normalised orig="rais'd" auto="true">raised</normalised> a fresh opposition against<lb/>
this Doctrine, he was <normalised orig="compell'd" auto="true">compelled</normalised> to recant it by<lb/>
Pope Nicholas and the Council at Rome, in these words,<lb/>
that the bread and wine which are set upon the Altar,<lb/>
after the consecration are not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> the Sacrament, but<lb/>
the true body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of our Lord Jesus Christ; and<lb/>
are sensibly, not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> in the Sacrament but in truth,<lb/>
handled and broken by the hands of the Priest, and<lb/>
ground or bruised by the teeth of the <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised>. But it<lb/>
seems the Pope and his Council were not then <normalised orig="skilfull" auto="true">skilful</normalised><lb/>
enough to express themselves rightly in this matter;<lb/>
for the Gloss upon the Canon Law says <normalised orig="expresly" auto="true">expressly</normalised>, that<lb/>
unless we understand these words of BERENGARIUS<lb/>
(that is in truth of the Pope and his Council) in a sound<lb/>
sense, we shall fall into a greater <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised> than that of<lb/>
BERENGARIUS; for we do not make parts of the<lb/>
body of Christ. The meaning of which Gloss I cannot<lb/>
imagine, unless it be this, that the Body of Christ,<lb/>
though it be in truth broken, yet it is not broken into<lb/>
parts (for we do not make parts of the body of Christ,)<lb/>
but into wholes: Now this new way of breaking a Body,<lb/>
not into parts but into wholes (which in good earnest is<lb/>
the Doctrine of the Church of Rome) though to them<lb/>
that are able to believe Transubstantiation it may for any<lb/>
thing I know appear to be sound sense, yet to us that<lb/>
cannot believe so it appears to be solid non-sense.<lb/>

                  <lb/>
About XX years after, in the year MLXXIX Pope<lb/>
Gregory the VII<hi rend="high">th</hi> began to be sensible of this absurdity;<lb/>
and <choice ana="print">
                     <sic>thereforeinanother</sic>
                     <corr>therefore in another</corr>
                  </choice> Council at Rome made Berengarius<lb/>
to recant in another Form, viz. that the bread and<lb/>
wine which are placed upon the Altar are substantially<lb/>
changed into the true and proper and <normalised orig="quickning" auto="true">quickening</normalised> flesh and<lb/>
<normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of our Lord Jesus Christ, and after consecration<lb/>
are the true body of Christ, which was born of the Virgin,<lb/>
and which being offered for the Salvation of the<lb/>
World did hang upon the Cross, and sits on the right<lb/>
hand of the Father.<lb/>
So that from the first starting of this Doctrine in<lb/>
the second Council of Nice in the year DCCLXXXVII,<lb/>
till the Council under Pope Gregory the VII<hi rend="high">th</hi> in the<lb/>
year MLXXIX, it was almost three hundred years<lb/>
that this Doctrine was contested, and before this <normalised orig="mishapen" auto="true">misshapen</normalised><lb/>
Monster of Transubstantiation could be <normalised orig="lick'd" auto="true">licked</normalised> into<lb/>
that Form in which it is now <normalised orig="setled" auto="true">settled</normalised> and <normalised orig="establish'd" auto="true">established</normalised> in<lb/>
the Church of Rome. Here then is a plain account of<lb/>
the first rise of this Doctrine, and of the several steps<lb/>
whereby it was advanced by the Church of Rome into<lb/>
an Article of Faith. I come now in the<lb/>
Third place, to answer the great pretended Demonstration<lb/>
of the impossibility that this Doctrine, if it had<lb/>
been new, should ever have come in, in any Age, and<lb/>
been received in the Church; and consequently it must of<lb/>
necessity have been the perpetual belief of the Church in<lb/>
all Ages: For if it had not always been the Doctrine<lb/>
of the Church, when ever it had attempted first to<lb/>
come in there would have been a great stir and bustle<lb/>
about it, and the whole Christian World would have<lb/>
rose up in opposition to it. But we can <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> no such<lb/>
time when it first came in, and when any such opposition<lb/>
was made to it, and therefore it was always the<lb/>
Doctrine of the Church. This Demonstration Monsieur<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="26">D2</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
Arnauld, a very learned Man in France, pretends to be<lb/>
unanswerable: whether it be so or not, I shall briefly<lb/>
examine. And<lb/>
First, we do assign a punctual and very likely time<lb/>
of the first rise of this Doctrine, about the beginning<lb/>
of the ninth Age; though it did not take firm root<lb/>
nor was fully <normalised orig="setled" auto="true">settled</normalised> and <normalised orig="establish'd" auto="true">established</normalised> till towards the end<lb/>
of the eleventh. And this was the most likely time<lb/>
of all other, from the beginning of Christianity, for<lb/>
so gross an <normalised orig="Errour" auto="true">Error</normalised> to appear; it being, by the confession<lb/>
and consent of their own Historians, the most<lb/>
dark and dismal time that ever happened to the Christian<lb/>
Church, both for Ignorance, and Superstition, and<lb/>
Vice. It came in together with Idolatry, and was<lb/>
made use of to support it: A fit prop and companion<lb/>
for it. And indeed what tares might not the Enemy<lb/>
have sown in so dark and long a Night; when so considerable<lb/>
a part of the Christian World was <normalised orig="lull'd" auto="true">lulled</normalised> asleep<lb/>
in profound Ignorance and Superstition? And this agrees<lb/>
very well with the account which our Saviour<lb/>
himself gives in the Parable of the Tares, of the springing<lb/>
up of <normalised orig="Errours" auto="true">Errors</normalised> and Corruptions in the Field of the<lb/>
Church. While the men slept the Enemy did his work<lb/>
in the Night, so that when they were awake they<lb/>
wondered how and whence the tares came; but being<lb/>
sure they were there, and that they were not sown<lb/>
at first, they concluded the Enemy had done it.<lb/>
Secondly, I have <normalised orig="shewn" auto="true">shown</normalised> likewise that there was considerable<lb/>
opposition made to this <normalised orig="Errour" auto="true">Error</normalised> at its first coming<lb/>
in. The general Ignorance and gross Superstition<lb/>
of that Age rendered the generality of people more<lb/>
quiet and secure, and disposed them to receive any<lb/>
thing that came under a pretence of mystery in Religion<lb/>
and of greater reverence and devotion to the Sacrament,<lb/>
and that seemed any way to countenance<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="27">26</fw>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
the worship of Images, for which at that time they<lb/>
were zealously <normalised orig="concern'd" auto="true">concerned</normalised>. But notwithstanding the<lb/>
security and passive temper of the People, the men<lb/>
most eminent for piety and learning in that Time<lb/>
made great resistance against it. I have already named<lb/>
Rabanus Arch-Bishop of Mentz, who <normalised orig="oppos'd" auto="true">opposed</normalised> it<lb/>
as an <normalised orig="Errour" auto="true">Error</normalised> lately sprung up and which had then<lb/>
gained but upon some few persons. To whom I may<lb/>
add Heribaldus Bishop of Auxerres in France, Io. Scotus<lb/>
Erigena, and Ratramnus commonly known by the<lb/>
name of Bertram, who at the same time were employed<lb/>
by the <normalised orig="Emperour" auto="true">Emperor</normalised> Charles the Bald to oppose this<lb/>
growing <normalised orig="Errour" auto="true">Error</normalised>, and wrote learnedly against it. And<lb/>
these were the eminent men for learning in that time.<lb/>
And because Monsieur Arnauld will not be satisfied unless<lb/>
there were some stir and bustle about it, Bertram<lb/>
in his Preface to his Book tells us, that they who according<lb/>
to their several opinions talked differently about<lb/>
the mystery of Christ's body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> were divided by no<lb/>
small Schism.<lb/>
Thirdly, Though for a more clear and satisfactory<lb/>
answer to this pretended Demonstration I have been<lb/>
contented to untie this knot, yet I could without all<lb/>
these pains have cut it. For suppose this Doctrine had<lb/>
silently come in and without opposition, so that we<lb/>
could not assign the particular time and occasion of<lb/>
its first Rise; yet if it be evident from the Records of<lb/>
former Ages, for above D. years together, that this was<lb/>
not the ancient belief of the Church; and plain also,<lb/>
that this Doctrine was afterwards received in the Roman<lb/>
Church, though we could not tell how and when<lb/>
it came in, yet it would be the wildest and most extravagant<lb/>
thing in the world to set up a pretended Demonstration<lb/>
of Reason against plain Experience and<lb/>
matter of Fact. This is just Zeno's Demonstration of<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="28">27</fw>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
the impossibility of motion against Diogenes walking<lb/>
before his Eyes. For this is to undertake to prove<lb/>
that impossible to have been, which most certainly<lb/>
was. Just thus the Servants in the Parable might<lb/>
have demonstrated that the tares were wheat, because<lb/>
they were sure none but good seed was sown at first,<lb/>
and no man could give any account of the punctual<lb/>
time when any tares were sown, or by whom; and<lb/>
if an Enemy had come to do it; he must needs have<lb/>
met with great resistance and opposition; but no such<lb/>
resistance was made, and therefore there could be no<lb/>
tares in the field, but that which they <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> tares was<lb/>
certainly good wheat. At the same rate a man might<lb/>
demonstrate that our King, his Majesty of great Britain,<lb/>
is not <normalised orig="return'd" auto="true">returned</normalised> into England, nor <normalised orig="restor'd" auto="true">restored</normalised> to his Crown;<lb/>
because there being so great and <normalised orig="powerfull" auto="true">powerful</normalised> an Army<lb/>
<normalised orig="possess'd" auto="true">possessed</normalised> of his Lands, and therefore obliged by interest<lb/>
to keep him out, it was impossible He should ever<lb/>
come in without a great deal of fighting and <normalised orig="bloudshed" auto="true">bloodshed</normalised>:<lb/>
but there was no such thing, therefore he is not<lb/>
<normalised orig="return'd" auto="true">returned</normalised> and <normalised orig="restor'd" auto="true">restored</normalised> to his Crown. And by the like<lb/>
kind of Demonstration one might prove that the<lb/>
Turk did not invade Christendom last year, and besiege<lb/>
Vienna; because if he had, the most Christian King,<lb/>
who had the greatest Army in Christendom in a readiness,<lb/>
would certainly have employed it against him;<lb/>
but Monsieur Arnauld certainly knows, no such thing<lb/>
was done: And therefore according to his way of Demonstration,<lb/>
the matter of fact, so commonly reported<lb/>
and believed, concerning the Turks Invasion of<lb/>
Christendom and besieging Vienna last year, was a<lb/>
perfect mistake. But a man may demonstrate till his<lb/>
head and heart <normalised orig="ake" auto="true">ache</normalised>, before he shall ever be able to<lb/>
prove that which certainly is, or was, never to have<lb/>
been. For of all sorts of impossibles nothing is more<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="29">28</fw>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
evidently so, than to make that which <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been not<lb/>
to have been. All the reason in the world is too weak<lb/>
to cope with so tough and obstinate a difficulty. And<lb/>
I have often <normalised orig="wonder'd" auto="true">wondered</normalised> how a man of Monsieur Arnauld's<lb/>
great wit and sharp Judgment could prevail with himself<lb/>
to engage in so <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> and baffled a Cause; or could<lb/>
think to defend it with so wooden a Dagger as his Demonstration<lb/>
of Reason against certain Experience and<lb/>
matter of Fact: A thing, if it be possible, of equal absurdity<lb/>
with what he pretends to demonstrate, Transubstantiation<lb/>
it self. I proceed to the<lb/>
Third pretended Ground of this Doctrine of Transubstantiation;<lb/>
and that is, The infallible Authority of<lb/>
the present Church to make and declare new Articles of<lb/>
Faith. And this in truth is the ground into which<lb/>
the most of the learned men of their Church did heretofore,<lb/>
and many do still resolve their belief of this<lb/>
Doctrine: And, as I have already <normalised orig="shewn" auto="true">shown</normalised>, do plainly<lb/>
say that they see no sufficient reason, either from Scripture<lb/>
or Tradition, for the belief of it: And that they<lb/>
should have believed the contrary had not the determination<lb/>
of the Church obliged them otherwise.<lb/>
But if this Doctrine be obtruded upon the world<lb/>
merely by virtue of the Authority of the Roman<lb/>
Church, and the Declaration of the Council under<lb/>
Pope Gregory the VII<hi rend="high">th</hi> or of the Lateran Council under<lb/>
Innocent the III. then it is a plain Innovation in<lb/>
the Christian Doctrine, and a new Article of Faith <normalised orig="impos'd" auto="true">imposed</normalised><lb/>
upon the Christian world. And if any Church<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> this power, the Christian Faith may be enlarged<lb/>
and changed as often as men please; and that which is<lb/>
no part of our Saviour's Doctrine, nay, any thing<lb/>
though never so absurd and unreasonable, may become<lb/>
an Article of Faith obliging all Christians to the belief<lb/>
of it, whenever the Church of Rome shall think fit to<lb/>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
stamp her Authority upon it: which would make<lb/>
Christianity a most uncertain and endless thing.<lb/>
The Fourth pretended ground of this Doctrine is,<lb/>
the necessity of such a change as this in the Sacrament to<lb/>
the comfort and benefit of those who receive it. But<lb/>
there is no colour for this, if the thing be rightly <normalised orig="consider'd" auto="true">considered</normalised>:<lb/>
Because the comfort and benefit of the Sacrament<lb/>
depends upon the blessing annexed to the Institution.<lb/>
And as Water in Baptism, without any substantial<lb/>
change made in that Element, may by the Divine<lb/>
blessing accompanying the Institution be effectual to<lb/>
the washing away of Sin, and Spiritual Regeneration;<lb/>
So there can no reason in the world be given why the<lb/>
Elements of Bread and Wine in the Lord's Supper may<lb/>
not, by the same Divine blessing accompanying this<lb/>
Institution, make the worthy receivers partakers of all<lb/>
the Spiritual comfort and benefit designed to us thereby,<lb/>
without any substantial change made in those Elements,<lb/>
since our Lord <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> told us, that verily the<lb/>
flesh <normalised orig="profiteth" auto="true">profits</normalised> nothing. So that if we could do so odd<lb/>
and strange a thing as to eat the very natural flesh and<lb/>
drink the <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of our Lord, I do not see of what<lb/>
greater advantage it would be to us than what we may<lb/>
have by partaking of the Symbols of his body and<lb/>
<normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> as he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> appointed in remembrance of him.<lb/>
For the Spiritual efficacy of the Sacrament <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not<lb/>
depend upon the nature of the thing received, supposing<lb/>
we receive what our Lord appointed, and receive<lb/>
it with a right preparation and disposition of mind,<lb/>
but upon the supernatural blessing that goes along with<lb/>
it, and makes it effectual to those Spiritual ends for<lb/>
which it was appointed.<lb/>
The Fifth and last pretended ground of this Doctrine<lb/>
is, to magnify the power of the Priest in being able to<lb/>
work so great a Miracle. And this with great pride and<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="31">30</fw>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
pomp is often <normalised orig="urg'd" auto="true">urged</normalised> by them as a transcendent instance<lb/>
of the Divine <normalised orig="wisedom" auto="true">wisdom</normalised>, to find out so admirable a way<lb/>
to raise the power and reverence of the Priest; that<lb/>
he should be able every day, and as often as he pleases,<lb/>
by repeating a few words to work so miraculous a<lb/>
change, and (as they love most absurdly and blasphemously<lb/>
to speak) to make God himself.<lb/>
But this is to pretend to a power above that of God<lb/>
himself, for he did not, nor cannot make himself, nor<lb/>
do any thing that implies a contradiction, as Transubstantiation<lb/>
evidently does in their pretending to make<lb/>
God. For to make that which already is, and to make<lb/>
that now which always was, is not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> vain and trifling<lb/>
if it could be done, but impossible because it implies<lb/>
a contradiction.<lb/>
And what if after all Transubstantiation, if it were<lb/>
possible and actually wrought by the Priest, would<lb/>
yet be no Miracle? For there are two things necessary<lb/>
to a Miracle, that there be a supernatural effect<lb/>
wrought, and that this effect be evident to sense. So<lb/>
that though a supernatural effect be wrought, yet if<lb/>
it be not evident to sense it is to all the ends and purposes<lb/>
of a Miracle as if it were not; and can be no<lb/>
testimony or proof of any thing, because it self stands<lb/>
in need of another Miracle to give testimony to it and<lb/>
to prove that it was wrought. And neither in Scripture,<lb/>
nor in profane <normalised orig="Authours" auto="true">Authors</normalised>, nor in common use of speech,<lb/>
is any thing <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> a Miracle but what falls under the<lb/>
notice of our senses: A Miracle being nothing else but<lb/>
a supernatural effect evident to sense, the great end and<lb/>
design whereof is to be a sensible proof and conviction<lb/>
to us of something that we do not see.<lb/>
And for want of this Condition, Transubstantiation,<lb/>
if it were true, would be no Miracle. It would indeed<lb/>
be very supernatural, but for all that it would<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="32">E</fw>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
not be a Sign or Miracle: For a Sign or Miracle is always<lb/>
a thing sensible, otherwise it could be no Sign.<lb/>
Now that such a change as is pretended in Transubstantiation<lb/>
should really be wrought, and yet there<lb/>
should be no sign and appearance of it, is a thing very<lb/>
<normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised>, but not to sense; for our senses perceive<lb/>
no change, the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament to all<lb/>
our senses remaining just as they were before: And<lb/>
that a thing should remain to all appearance just as it<lb/>
was, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> nothing at all of wonder in it: we wonder<lb/>
indeed when we see a strange thing done, but no man<lb/>
wonders when he sees nothing done.<lb/>
