               <head>What is that means, whereby the revealed Truths of God are conveyed to our Understanding,<lb/>
and which must determine Controversies in Faith and Religion.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
OF our estimation, respect, and reverence to holy Scripture, even Protestants themselves<lb/>
do in fact give testimony, while they possess it from us, and take it upon the integrity<lb/>
of our custody. No cause imaginable could avert our will from giving the function of<lb/>
supreme and sole Judge to holy Writ, if both the thing were not impossible in it self,<lb/>
and if both reason and experience did not convince our understanding, that, by this<lb/>
Assertion Contentions are increased, and not ended. We acknowledge holy Scripture<lb/>
to be a most perfect Rule, for as much as a Writing can be a Rule: We only deny that it excludes,<lb/>
either divine Tradition, though it be unwritten, or an external Judge to keep, to propose, to interpret<lb/>
in a true, Orthodox, and <normalised orig="Catholique" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> sense. Every single Book, every Chapter, yea, every period of holy<lb/>
Scripture is infallibly true, and wants no due perfection. But must we therefore <normalised orig="inferr" auto="false">infer</normalised>, that all other Books<lb/>
of Scripture are to be excluded, lest, by addition of them, we may seem to derogate from the perfection<lb/>
of the former? When the first Books of the Old and New Testament were written, they did not exclude<lb/>
unwritten Traditions, nor the Authority of the Church to decide Controversies; and who <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised><lb/>
then so altered their nature, and filled them with such jealousies, as that now they cannot agree for<lb/>
fear of mutual disparagement? What greater wrong is it for the written Word, to be compartner now<lb/>
with the unwritten, than for the unwritten, which was once alone, to be <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterwards</normalised> <normalised orig="joyned" auto="true">joined</normalised>, with the<lb/>
written? Who ever heard, that, to commend the fidelity of a Keeper, were to disauthorize the thing<lb/>
committed to his custody? Or that, to extol the integrity and knowledge, and to avouch the necessity<lb/>
of a Judge in suits of Law, were to deny perfection in the Law? Are there not in Commonwealths,<lb/>
besides the Laws, written and unwritten customs, Judges appointed to declare both the one,<lb/>
and the other, as several occasions may require?<lb/>
2. That the Scripture alone cannot be Judge in Controversies of Faith, we gather it very clearly, From<lb/>
the quality of a writing in general: From the nature of holy Writ in particular, which must be believed<lb/>
as true, and infallible: From the Editions, and Translations of it: From the difficulty to understand<lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
it without hazard of Error: From the inconveniences that must follow upon the ascribing of sole Judicature<lb/>
to it: and finally, From the Confessions of our Adversaries. And, on the other side, all these difficulties<lb/>
ceasing, and all other qualities requisite to a Judge concurring in the visible Church of Christ<lb/>
our Lord, we must conclude, that She it is, to whom, in doubts concerning Faith and Religion, all<lb/>
Christians ought to have recourse.<lb/>
3. The name, notion, nature, and properties of a Judge cannot in common reason agree to any<lb/>
<normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> writing, which, be it otherwise in it its kind, never so highly qualified with sanctity and infallibility;<lb/>
yet it must ever be, as all writings are, deaf, dumb, and inanimate. By a Judge, all wise<lb/>
men understand a person endued with life, and reason, able to hear, to examine, to declare his mind<lb/>
to the disagreeing parties, in such sort as that each one may know whether the sentence be in favour of<lb/>
his cause, or against his pretence; and he must be applyable, and able to do all this, as the diversity of<lb/>
Controversies, Persons, Occasions, and Circumstances may require. There is a great and plain distinction<lb/>
betwixt a Judge and a Rule. For, as in a Kingdom, the Judge <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> his Rule to follow, which<lb/>
are the received Laws and Customs; so are not they fit <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>orable</sic>
                     <corr>or able</corr>
                  </choice> to declare, or be Judges to themselves, but<lb/>
that office must belong to a living Judge. The holy Scripture may be, and is, a Rule; but cannot be a<lb/>
Judge, because, it being always the same, cannot declare it self any one time, or upon any one occasion,<lb/>
more particularly then upon any other; and let it be read over an hundred times, it will be still<lb/>
the same, and no more fit alone to terminate Controversies in Faith, than the Law would be to end<lb/>
suits, if it were given over to the fancy, and gloss of every single man.<lb/>
4. This difference betwixt a Judge and a Rule, D. Potter perceived, when, more than once having<lb/>
stiled the Scripture a Judge, by way of correcting that term, he adds, or rather a Rule, because he knew<lb/>
that an inanimate writing could not be a Judge. From hence also it was, that, though Protestants in their<lb/>
beginning affirmed Scripture alone to be the Judge of Controversies; yet, upon a more advised reflection,<lb/>
they changed the phrase, and said, that not Scripture, but the Holy Ghost speaking in Scripture, is Judge<lb/>
in Controversies. A difference without a disparity. The Holy Ghost speaking only in Scripture, is no<lb/>
more intelligible to us, than the Scripture in which he speaks: as a man speaking only Latin, can be no<lb/>
better understood, than the tongue wherein he <normalised orig="speaketh" auto="true">speaks</normalised>. And therefore to say, A Judge is necessary for<lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>d*ciding</sic>
                     <corr>deciding</corr>
                  </choice> Controversies, about the meaning of Scripture, is as much as to say, He is necessary to decide<lb/>
what the holy Ghost speaks in Scripture. And, it were a conceit, equally foolish and <normalised orig="pernitious" auto="true">pernicious</normalised>, if one<lb/>
should seek to take away all Judges in the Kingdom, upon this nicety, that, albeit Laws cannot be<lb/>
Judges, yet the Law-maker speaking in the Law, may perform that Office; as if the Law-maker<lb/>
speaking in the Law, were with more perspicuity understood, than the Law whereby he <normalised orig="speaketh" auto="true">speaks</normalised>.<lb/>

               <head>An ANSWER to the SECOND CHAPTER.<lb/>
Concerning the means, whereby the revealed Truths of God are conveyed to<lb/>
our Understanding; and which must determine Controversies in Faith<lb/>
and Religion.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  AD §. 1. He that would usurp an absolute Lordship and tyranny<lb/>
over any people, need not put himself to the trouble and difficulty<lb/>
of abrogating and disanulling the Laws, made to<lb/>
maintain the common liberty; for he may frustrate their intent,<lb/>
and compass his own design as well, if he can get the<lb/>
power and authority to interpret them as he pleases, and add to them<lb/>
what he pleases, and to have his interpretations and additions stand for<lb/>
Laws; if he can rule his people by his Laws, and his Laws by his Lawyers.<lb/>
So the Church of Rome, to establish her tyranny over <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> consciences, needed<lb/>
not either to abolish or corrupt the holy Scriptures, the Pillars and supporters<lb/>
of Christian liberty (which in regard of the numerous multitude of<lb/>
Copies dispersed through all places, translated into almost all Languages,<lb/>
guarded with all sollicitous care and industry, had been an impossible attempt;)<lb/>
But the more expedite way, and therefore more likely to be <normalised orig="successeful" auto="true">successful</normalised>,<lb/>
was, to gain the opinion and esteem of the <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> and <normalised orig="authoriz'd" auto="true">authorised</normalised><lb/>
Interpreter of them, and the Authority of adding to them what <normalised orig="Doctrin" auto="true">Doctrine</normalised><lb/>
she pleased under the title of Traditions or Definitions. For by this means,<lb/>
she might both serve her self of all those clauses of Scripture, which might<lb/>
be <choice ana="typeset-error">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr>drawn</corr>
                  </choice> to cast a favourable countenance upon her ambitious pretences,<lb/>
which in case the Scripture had been abolished, she could not have done;<lb/>
and yet be secure enough of having either her power limited, or her corruptions<lb/>
and abuses reformed by them; this being once <normalised orig="setled" auto="true">settled</normalised> in the minds<lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
of men, that unwritten <normalised orig="doctrins" auto="true">doctrines</normalised>, if proposed by her, were to be received with<lb/>
equal reverence to those that were written; and that the sense of Scripture was<lb/>
not that which seemed to <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> reason and understanding to be so, but that which<lb/>
the Church of Rome should declare to be so, seemed it never so unreasonable<lb/>
and incongruous. The matter being once thus ordered, and the holy Scriptures<lb/>
being made in effect not your Directors and Judges (no farther than<lb/>
you please) but your servants and instruments, <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> <normalised orig="prest" auto="true">pressed</normalised> and in readiness<lb/>
to advance your <normalised orig="designes" auto="true">designs</normalised>, and disabled wholly with minds so qualified<lb/>
to prejudice or impeach them; it is safe for you to put a crown on their<lb/>
head, and a reed in their hands, and to bow before them, and cry, Hail King<lb/>
of the Jews! to pretend a great deal of esteem, and respect, and reverence to<lb/>
them, as here you do. But to little purpose is verbal reverence without entire<lb/>
submission and <normalised orig="syncere" auto="true">sincere</normalised> obedience; and, as our Saviour said of some,<lb/>
so the Scripture, could it speak, I believe would say to you, Why call <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised><lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>m*</sic>
                     <corr>me</corr>
                  </choice> Lord, Lord, and do not that which I command you? Cast away the vain<lb/>
and arrogant pretence of infallibility, which makes your errors incurable.<lb/>
Leave picturing God, and worshipping him by pictures. Teach not for <normalised orig="Doctrin" auto="true">Doctrine</normalised><lb/>
the <normalised orig="commandements" auto="true">commandments</normalised> of men. Debarr not the Laity of the Testament<lb/>
of Christ's Blood. Let your <normalised orig="publique" auto="true">public</normalised> Prayers, and Psalms, and Hymns be<lb/>
in such language as is for the edification of the Assistents. Take not from<lb/>
the Clergy that liberty of Marriage which Christ <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> left them. Do not<lb/>
impose upon men that Humility of worshipping Angels which S. Paul condemns.<lb/>
Teach no more proper sacrifices of Christ but one. <normalised orig="Acknowledg" auto="true">Acknowledge</normalised><lb/>
them that die in Christ to be blessed, and to rest from their labours. Acknowledge<lb/>
the Sacrament after Consecration, to be Bread and Wine, as well as<lb/>
Christs body and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>. <normalised orig="Acknowledg" auto="true">Acknowledge</normalised> the gift of <normalised orig="continency" auto="true">continence</normalised> without Marriage,<lb/>
not to be given to all. Let not the weapons of your warfare be carnal,<lb/>
such as Massacres, Treasons, Persecutions, and, in a word, all means either<lb/>
violent or fraudulent: These and other things, which the Scripture commands<lb/>
you, do, and then we shall willingly give you such Testimony as you<lb/>
deserve; but till you do so, to talk of estimation, respect, and reverence to<lb/>
the Scripture, is nothing else but talk.<lb/>
2. For neither is that true which you pretend, That we possess the Scripture<lb/>
from you, or take it upon the integrity of your Custody; but upon Universal<lb/>
Tradition, of which you are but a little part. Neither, if it were true that<lb/>
Protestants acknowledged, The integrity of it to have been guarded by your<lb/>
alone Custody, were this any argument of your reverence towards them.<lb/>
For first, you might preserve them entire, not for want of Will, but of<lb/>
Power to corrupt them, as it is a hard thing to <normalised orig="poyson" auto="true">poison</normalised> the Sea. And then having<lb/>
prevailed so <normalised orig="farr" auto="true">far</normalised> with men, as either not to look at all into them, or but<lb/>
only through such spectacles as you should please to make for them, and to<lb/>
see nothing in them, though as <normalised orig="cleer" auto="true">clear</normalised> as the sun, if it any way made against<lb/>
you, you might keep them entire, without any thought or care to conform<lb/>
your <normalised orig="doctrin" auto="true">doctrine</normalised> to them, or reform it by them (which were indeed to reverence<lb/>
the Scriptures;) but, out of a <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised>, that you could qualify them<lb/>
well enough with your glosses and interpretations, and make them sufficiently<lb/>
conformable to your present <normalised orig="Doctrin" auto="true">Doctrine</normalised>, at least in their judgement, who<lb/>
were prepossessed with this <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised>, that your Church was to Judge of the<lb/>
sense of Scripture, not to be judged by it.<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
3. For, whereas you say, No cause imaginable could avert your will, for<lb/>
giving the function of supreme and sole Judge to holy Writ; but that the thing<lb/>
is impossible, and that by this means controversies are increased and not ended:<lb/>
you mean perhaps, - That you can or will imagine no other cause but these.<lb/>
But sure there is little reason you should measure other <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> imaginations<lb/>
by your own, who perhaps may be so clouded and <normalised orig="vailed" auto="true">veiled</normalised> with prejudice,<lb/>
that you cannot, or will not, see that which is most manifest. For what indifferent<lb/>
and unprejudicate man may not easily conceive another cause which<lb/>
(I do not say does, but certainly) may pervert your wills, and avert your<lb/>
understandings from submitting your Religion and Church to a <normalised orig="tryall" auto="true">trial</normalised> by<lb/>
Scripture? I mean the great and apparent and unavoidable danger which<lb/>
by this means you would fall into, of losing the Opinion which men have<lb/>
of your Infallibility, and consequently your power and authority over<lb/>
<normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> consciences, and all that depends upon it. So that though Diana of the<lb/>
Ephesians be <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> up, yet it may be feared that with a great many among<lb/>
you (though I censure or judge no man) the other cause which wrought<lb/>
upon Demetrius and the Craftsmen, may have with you also the more effectual,<lb/>
though more secret influence: and that is, that by this craft we have<lb/>
our living; by this craft, I mean, of keeping your Proselytes from an indifferent<lb/>
<normalised orig="tryal" auto="true">trial</normalised> of your Religion by Scripture, and making them yield up<lb/>
and captivate their judgement unto yours. Yet had you only said de facto,<lb/>
that no other cause did avert your own will from this, but only these which<lb/>
you pretend; out of Charity I should have believed you. But seeing you<lb/>
speak not of your self, but of all of your Side, whose hearts you cannot<lb/>
know; and profess not only, That there is no other cause, but that No<lb/>
other is imaginable, I could not let this <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> without a censure. As for<lb/>
the impossibility of Scriptures being the sole Judge of Controversies, that<lb/>
is, the sole Rule for men to judge them by (for we mean nothing else)<lb/>
you only affirm it without proof, as if the thing were evident of it self.<lb/>
And therefore I, conceiving the contrary to be more evident, might well<lb/>
content my self to deny it without refutation. Yet I cannot but desire you to<lb/>
tell me, If Scripture cannot be the Judge of any <normalised orig="Controversie" auto="true">Controversy</normalised>, how shall that<lb/>
touching the Church and the Notes of <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>i*</sic>
                     <corr>it</corr>
                  </choice>, be determined? And if it be the sole<lb/>
Judge of this one, why may it not of others? Why not of All? Those only<lb/>
excepted wherein the Scripture it self is the subject of the Question, which<lb/>
cannot be determined but by natural reason, the only principle, beside Scripture,<lb/>
which is common to Christians.<lb/>
4. Then for the Imputation of increasing contentions and not ending them,<lb/>
Scripture is innocent of it; as also this opinion, That controversies are to be<lb/>
decided by Scripture. For if men did really and sincerely submit their judgements<lb/>
to Scripture, and that only, and would require no more of any man<lb/>
but to do so, it were impossible but that all Controversies, touching things<lb/>
necessary and very profitable should be ended: and if others were continued<lb/>
or increased, it were no matter.<lb/>
5. In the next words we have direct <normalised orig="Boyes-play" auto="false">Boys-play</normalised>; a thing given with one<lb/>
hand, and taken away with the other: an acknowledgment made in one<lb/>
line, and retracted in the next, We <normalised orig="acknowledg" auto="true">acknowledge</normalised> (say you) Scripture to be a perfect<lb/>
rule, for as much as a Writing can be a Rule; only we deny that it excludes<lb/>
unwritten Tradition. As if you should have said, We <normalised orig="acknowledg" auto="true">acknowledge</normalised> it to be as<lb/>
perfect a Rule as a Writing can be; only we deny it to be as perfect a Rule<lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
as a writing may be. Either therefore you must revoke your acknowledgment,<lb/>
or retract your retractation of it; for both cannot possibly stand together.<lb/>
For if you will stand to what you have granted, That Scripture is as<lb/>
perfect a Rule of Faith as a writing can be: you must then grant it both so<lb/>
<normalised orig="Compleat" auto="true">Complete</normalised>, that it needs no addition, and so evident, that it needs no interpretation:<lb/>
For both these properties are requisite to a perfect Rule, and a<lb/>
writing is capable of both these properties.<lb/>
6. That both these properties are requisite to a perfect <choice ana="typeset-error">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr>Rule</corr>
                  </choice>, it is apparent:<lb/>
Because that is not perfect in any kind which wants some parts belonging<lb/>
to its integrity; As, he is not a perfect man that wants any part appertaining<lb/>
to the Integrity of a Man; and therefore that which wants any<lb/>
accession to make it a perfect Rule, of it self is not a perfect Rule. And<lb/>
then, the end of a Rule is to regulate and direct. Now every instrument is<lb/>
more or <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> perfect in its kind, as it is more or <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> fit to attain the end<lb/>
for which it is ordained: But nothing obscure or unevident while it is so,<lb/>
is fit to regulate and direct them to whom it is so: Therefore it is requisite<lb/>
also to a Rule (so <normalised orig="farr" auto="true">far</normalised> as it is a Rule) to be evident; otherwise indeed it is<lb/>
no Rule, because it cannot serve for direction. I conclude therefore, that<lb/>
both these properties are required to a perfect Rule: both to be so <normalised orig="compleat" auto="true">complete</normalised><lb/>
as to need no Addition; and to be so evident as to need no Interpretation.<lb/>
7. Now that a writing is capable of both these perfections, it is so <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>pla*n</sic>
                     <corr>plain</corr>
                  </choice>,<lb/>
that I am even ashamed to prove it. For he that denies it, must say, That<lb/>
something may be spoken which cannot be written. For if such a <normalised orig="compleat" auto="true">complete</normalised> and<lb/>
evident Rule of Faith may be delivered by word of mouth, as you pretend<lb/>
it may, and is; and whatsoever is delivered by word of mouth may also be<lb/>
written; then such a <normalised orig="compleat" auto="true">complete</normalised> and evident Rule of Faith may also be written.<lb/>
If you will have more light added to the Sun, answer me then to these<lb/>
Questions. Whether your Church can set down in <normalised orig="writting" auto="true">writing</normalised> all these,<lb/>
which she pretends to be divine unwritten Traditions, and add them to the<lb/>
verities already written? And, Whether she can set us down such interpretations<lb/>
of all obscurities in the Faith as shall need no farther interpretations?<lb/>
If she cannot, then she <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not that power which you pretend<lb/>
she <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised>, of being an Infallible Teacher of all divine verities, and an<lb/>
infallible Interpreter of obscurities in the Faith: for she cannot teach us<lb/>
all divine verities, if she cannot write them down; neither is that an interpretation<lb/>
which needs again to be interpreted. If she can; Let her do it,<lb/>
and then we shall have a <normalised orig="writting" auto="true">writing</normalised>, not only capable of, but, actually endowed<lb/>
with, both these perfections, of being both so <normalised orig="compleat" auto="true">complete</normalised> as to need<lb/>
no Addition, and so evident as to need no Interpretation. Lastly, whatsoever<lb/>
your Church can do or not do, no man can, without Blasphemy, deny,<lb/>
that Christ Jesus, if he had pleased, could have writ us a Rule of Faith so<lb/>
plain and perfect; as that it should have wanted neither any part to make<lb/>
up its integrity, nor any <normalised orig="cleerness" auto="false">clearness</normalised> to make it sufficiently intelligible. And if<lb/>
Christ could have done this, then the thing might have been done; a <normalised orig="writting" auto="true">writing</normalised><lb/>
there might have been, <normalised orig="indowed" auto="true">endowed</normalised> with both these properties. Thus therefore<lb/>
I conclude; a writing may be so perfect a Rule, as to need neither Addition<lb/>
nor Interpretation; But the Scripture you <normalised orig="acknowledg" auto="true">acknowledge</normalised> a perfect Rule for as<lb/>
much as a writing can be a Rule, therefore it needs neither Addition nor Interpretation.<lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
8. You will say, that though a writing be never so perfect a Rule of Faith,<lb/>
yet it must be beholding to Tradition to give it this Testimony, that it is a<lb/>
Rule of Faith, and the Word of God. I answer: First, there is no absolute necessity<lb/>
of this. For God might, if he thought good, give it the attestation of<lb/>
<normalised orig="perpetuall" auto="true">perpetual</normalised> miracles. Secondly, that it is one thing to be a perfect Rule of<lb/>
Faith, another to be proved so unto us. And thus though a writing could<lb/>
not be proved to us to be a perfect rule of Faith, by its <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> saying so, for<lb/>
nothing is proved true by being said or written in a book, but only by Tradition<lb/>
which is a thing credible of it self; yet it may be so in it self, and<lb/>
contain all the material objects, all the particular articles of our Faith,<lb/>
without any <normalised orig="dependance" auto="true">dependence</normalised> upon Tradition; even this also not excepted, that<lb/>
this writing <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> contain the rule of Faith. Now when Protestants affirm<lb/>
against Papists, that Scripture is a perfect Rule of Faith, their meaning is not,<lb/>
that by Scripture all things absolutely may be proved, which are to be<lb/>
believed: For it can never be proved by Scripture to a gainsayer, that there<lb/>
is a God, or that the book called Scripture is the word of God; For he that<lb/>
will deny these Assertions when they are spoken, will believe them<lb/>
never a whit the more, because you can <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> them written: But their meaning<lb/>
is, that the Scripture to them which presuppose it Divine, and a Rule<lb/>
of Faith, as Papists and Protestants do, contains all the material objects<lb/>
of Faith; is a <normalised orig="compleat" auto="true">complete</normalised> and total, and not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> an imperfect and a partial<lb/>
Rule.<lb/>
9. But every Book, and Chapter, and Text of Scripture is infallible and<lb/>
wants no due perfection, and yet excludes not the Addition of other books of<lb/>
Scripture; Therefore the perfection of the whole Scripture excludes not the Addition<lb/>
of unwritten Tradition. I answer; Every Text of Scripture though<lb/>
it <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> the perfection belonging to a Text of Scripture, yet it <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not the<lb/>
perfection requisite to a perfect Rule of Faith; and that only is the perfection<lb/>
which is the subject of our discourse. So that this is to abuse your Reader<lb/>
with the ambiguity of the word Perfect. In effect, as if you should say, A<lb/>
text of Scripture may be a perfect Text, though there be others beside it;<lb/>
therefore the whole Scripture may be a perfect Rule of Faith, though<lb/>
there be other parts of this Rule, besides the Scripture, and though the<lb/>
Scripture be but a part of it.<lb/>
10. The next Argument to the same purpose is, for Sophistry, cosen-german<lb/>
to the former. When the first books of Scripture were written, they did<lb/>
not exclude unwritten Tradition: Therefore now also, that all the books of<lb/>
Scripture are written, Traditions are not excluded. The sense of which argument<lb/>
(if it have any) must be this. When only a part of the Scripture was<lb/>
written, then a part of the divine doctrine was unwritten; Therefore now<lb/>
when all the Scripture is written, yet some part of the divine doctrine is yet<lb/>
unwritten. If you say, your Conclusion is not, that it is so, but, without disparagement<lb/>
to Scripture, may be so: without disparagement to the truth<lb/>
of Scripture, I grant it; but without disparagement to the Scripture's being<lb/>
a perfect Rule, I deny it. And now the Question is not of the Truth,<lb/>
but the perfection of it; which are very different things, though you would<lb/>
fain confound them. For Scripture might very well be all true, though<lb/>
it contain not all necessary Divine Truth. But <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> it do so, it cannot<lb/>
be a perfect Rule of Faith; for that which wants any thing is not perfect.<lb/>
For, I hope, you do not imagine, that we conceive any antipathy<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="50">49</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
between God's Word written and unwritten, but that both might very well<lb/>
stand together. All that we say is this, that we have reason to believe that<lb/>
God, de facto, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> ordered the matter so, that all the Gospel of Christ,<lb/>
the whole Covenant between God and man, is now written. Whereas, if<lb/>
he had pleased, he might so have disposed it, that, part might have been<lb/>
written, and part unwritten: but then he would have taken order, to<lb/>
whom we should have had recourse, for that part of it which was not<lb/>
written; which seeing he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not done (as the <normalised orig="progresse" auto="true">progress</normalised> shall demonstrate)<lb/>
it is evident he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> left no part of it unwritten. We know no man<lb/>
therefore that <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised>, It were any injury to the written Word to be <normalised orig="joyned" auto="true">joined</normalised><lb/>
with the unwritten, if there were any wherewith it might be <normalised orig="joyned" auto="true">joined</normalised>:<lb/>
but that, we deny. The fidelity of a keeper may very well consist with<lb/>
the authority of the thing committed to his custody. But we know no one<lb/>
society of Christians that is such a <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> keeper as you pretend. The<lb/>
Scripture it self was not kept so faithfully by you, but that you suffered<lb/>
infinite variety of Readings to creep into it; all which could not possibly be<lb/>
divine, and yet, in several parts of your Church, all of them, until the<lb/>
last Age, were so esteemed. The interpretations of obscure places of<lb/>
Scripture, which without Question the Apostles taught the Primitive Christians,<lb/>
are wholly lost; there remains no certainty scarce of any one.<lb/>
Those Worlds of Miracles, which our Saviour did, which were not written,<lb/>
for want of writing are vanished out of the memory of men. And<lb/>
many profitable things which the Apostles taught and writ not, as that<lb/>
which S. Paul <normalised orig="glanceth" auto="false">glanced</normalised> at in his second Epistle to the Thessal. of the cause of<lb/>
the <normalised orig="hinderance" auto="true">hindrance</normalised> of the coming of Antichrist, are wholly lost and extinguished.<lb/>
So unfaithful or negligent <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been this Keeper of Divine Verities;<lb/>
whose eyes, like the Keepers of Israel (you say) have never <normalised orig="slumbred" auto="true">slumbered</normalised><lb/>
nor slept. Lastly, we deny not but a Judge and a Law might well stand<lb/>
together, but we deny that there is any such Judge of Gods appointment.<lb/>
Had he intended any such Judge, he would have named him, lest otherwise<lb/>
(as now it is) our Judge of Controversies should be our greatest <normalised orig="Controversie" auto="true">Controversy</normalised>.<lb/>
11. Ad §. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. In your second Paragraph, you <normalised orig="sum" auto="true">some</normalised> up those<lb/>
Arguments wherewith you intend to prove that Scripture alone cannot be<lb/>
Judge in Controversies. Wherein I profess unto you before hand, that you<lb/>
will fight without an Adversary. For though Protestants, being warranted<lb/>
by some of the Fathers, have called Scripture the Judge of <normalised orig="Controversie" auto="true">Controversy</normalised>;<lb/>
and you, in saying here, That Scripture alone cannot be Judge, imply<lb/>
that it may be called in some sense a Judge, though not alone: Yet, to<lb/>
speak properly (as men should speak when they write of Controversies<lb/>
in Religion) the Scripture is not a Judge of Controversies, but a Rule<lb/>
only, and the only Rule for Christians to judge them by. Every man is to judge<lb/>
for himself with the Judgement of Discretion, and to choose either his<lb/>
Religion first, and then his Church, as we say: or, as you, his Church first,<lb/>
and then his Religion. But, by the consent of both sides, every man is to<lb/>
judge and choose: and the Rule whereby he is to guide his choice, if he be<lb/>
a natural man, is Reason; if he be already a Christian, Scripture; which we<lb/>
say is the Rule to judge Controversies by. Yet not all simply, but all the<lb/>
Controversies of Christians, of those that are already agreed upon This<lb/>
first Principle, that the Scripture is the Word of God. But that there is any<lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
Man, or any Company of men appointed to be Judge for all men, that we<lb/>
deny; and that I believe, you will never prove. The very truth is, we say<lb/>
no more in this matter, than evidence of Truth <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> made you confess in<lb/>
plain terms in the beginning of this Chapter, viz. That Scripture is a perfect<lb/>
Rule of Faith, for as much as a writing can be a Rule. So that all your<lb/>
Reasons, whereby you labour to dethrone the Scripture from this Office of<lb/>
Judging, we might let pass as impertinent to the Conclusion which we<lb/>
maintain, and you have already granted; yet out of <normalised orig="courtesie" auto="true">curtsy</normalised> we will<lb/>
consider them.<lb/>
12. Your first is this; A Judge must be a person fit to end Controversies;<lb/>
but the Scripture is not a person, nor fit to end Controversies, no more than the<lb/>
Law would be without the Judges; therefore though it may be a Rule, it cannot<lb/>
be a Judge. Which conclusion I have already granted. Only my request is,<lb/>
that you will permit Scripture to have the properties of a Rule, that is, to<lb/>
be fit to direct every one that will make the best use of it, to that end for<lb/>
which it was ordained: And that is as much as we need desire. For, as if<lb/>
I were to go a journey, and had a guide which could not err, I needed not<lb/>
to know my way: so on the other side, if I know my way, of have a plain<lb/>
rule to know it by, I shall need no guide. Grant therefore Scripture to be<lb/>
such a Rule, and it will quickly take away all necessity of having an infallible<lb/>
guide. But without a living Judge it will be no fitter (you say) to end<lb/>
Controversies, than the Law alone to end suits. I answer, if the Law were<lb/>
plain and perfect, and men honest and desirous to understand aright, and<lb/>
obey it, he that says it were not fit to end Controversies, must either want<lb/>
understanding himself, or think the world wants it. Now the Scripture, we<lb/>
pretend, in things necessary is plain and perfect; and men, we say, are obliged<lb/>
under pain of Damnation, to seek the true sense of it, and not to wrest<lb/>
it to their preconceived Fancies. Such a law therefore to such men, cannot<lb/>
but be very fit to end all Controversies necessary to be ended. For others<lb/>
that are not so, they will end when the world ends, and that is time enough.<lb/>
