vented in these times, besides an Addition of some <normalised orig="Errours" auto="true">Errors</normalised><lb/>
mentioned in the Appendix, and not enumerated in the former<lb/>

Catalogue of more <normalised orig="Errours" auto="true">Errors</normalised> not before named, neither, in the<lb/>
first, nor second Edition of my Book: As also a Relation of<lb/>
more Stories and Practices, together with some new Letters<lb/>

                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
1THat no Opinion is so dangerous or <normalised orig="Hereticall" auto="true">Heretical</normalised> as that of compulsion in<lb/>
things of Religion.<lb/>
2. That Kingly government among Nations and <normalised orig="Common-wealths" auto="true">Commonwealths</normalised> is <normalised orig="unlawfull" auto="true">unlawful</normalised>,<lb/>
and that for Kings it cannot be said to what use they serve, or that there<lb/>
is any use of them, except to debauch and <normalised orig="vexe" auto="true">vex</normalised> a people.<lb/>
3. It is unlawful for Christians to <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> any Swines flesh in regard the Devils<lb/>
once <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> into the herd of Swine.<lb/>
4. <normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> <normalised orig="unlawfull" auto="true">unlawful</normalised> to <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> any manner of blood in any kind of thing whatsoever, and that Black-puddings are unhallowed meat, and that the eating of<lb/>
Black-puddings is a barbarous <normalised orig="custome" auto="true">custom</normalised>.<lb/>
5. That the Devils never sinned, nor have any sin.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">B</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
6. That Judas, Cain, and all the damned, yea all the<lb/>
Devils shall be saved at last; and that there are no hell<lb/>
torments to eternity.<lb/>
7. Christ <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> repented perfectly, he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> sorrowed for sin perfectly, and<lb/>
he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> repented for us.<lb/>
8. Faith is not to be the guide of Reason, but Reason the guide of Faith,<lb/>
nor is a man to <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> any thing in Scripture, further then he sees Reason to<lb/>
induce him.<lb/>
9. That children of <normalised orig="beleevers" auto="true">believers</normalised> have more then a <normalised orig="fæderall" auto="false">federal</normalised> <normalised orig="holinesse" auto="true">holiness</normalised>, an inward<lb/>
<normalised orig="reall" auto="true">real</normalised> <normalised orig="holinesse" auto="true">holiness</normalised>.<lb/>
10. Christs presence in Heaven, or that Christ is present in Heaven, cannot<lb/>
be proved by the Scriptures.<lb/>
11. Some of the Sectaries do affirm and hold they have not only had Revelations,<lb/>
but they have seen Visions also.<lb/>
12. The means of God revealing himself and his mind and will to his servants<lb/>
in reference to their salvation, is <normalised orig="immediatly" auto="true">immediately</normalised> by himself, without Scripture,<lb/>
without Ordinances, Ministers, or any other means.<lb/>
13. That <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> <normalised orig="unlawfull" auto="true">unlawful</normalised> to give thanks to God after meat received, though<lb/>
it be <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised> to do it before eating of meat.<lb/>
14. That singing of Davids Psalms is blasphemy, and telling of lies.<lb/>
15. That there is no Justification by Faith, but Faith is only a manifestation<lb/>
of our Justification.<lb/>
16. That Repentance is a work of the Law, and so not to be performed by<lb/>
Christians; and that Christians have nothing to do at all, but only to sit still, hear<lb/>
and <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised>.<lb/>
17. Some Sectaries hold they cannot sin, but if they sin, Christ sins in them,<lb/>
he does all, they are acted by him in all.<lb/>
18. All set times of private prayers as morning and evening, &amp;c. are<lb/>
not only <normalised orig="unlawfull" auto="true">unlawful</normalised> and superstitious, but they are not to pray at all, nor give<lb/>
thanks, nor <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> sin, but admire only the Grace of God, that is all they must<lb/>
<normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>.<lb/>
19. That hell-fire never had been, if Jesus Christ had not come.<lb/>
20. That Jesus Christ delivered never a soul from Hell-fire.<lb/>
21. That all appointed set meetings of many Christians to pray, hear, confer,<lb/>
or perform any holy service, whether in a Church way, or out of a Church<lb/>
way, are unwarrantable, and <normalised orig="unlawfull" auto="true">unlawful</normalised>, only occasionally if Christians meet in<lb/>
a street, or at a house going to visit friends in civility, they may discourse and<lb/>
talk one with another in points of Religion as they do of other matters.<lb/>
22. That in the first Conversion of a sinner there ought to be no sorrow<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">2</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
nor repentance for <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>, God requires none at all.<lb/>
23. That some <normalised orig="Beleevers" auto="true">Believers</normalised> are as perfect here, as ever they shall be in Heaven,<lb/>
only they do not see the Lord here with their bodily eyes.<lb/>
And for a conclusion of this matter, namely for the enumeration of <normalised orig="Additionall" auto="true">Additional</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="Errours" auto="true">Errors</normalised>, I shall <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised> only this which I received from the mouth of a godly<lb/>
Minister, who <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>ha*ing</sic>
                     <corr>having</corr>
                  </choice> conversed with some Sectaries that are <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised> and<lb/>
Troopers, gave me this answer, March 13. upon a question propounded by me<lb/>
what strange opinions do they hold. They hold (saith he) all opinions whatsoever<lb/>
that are against the power of <normalised orig="godlinesse" auto="true">godliness</normalised>, and the honour of Christ.<lb/>

                  <lb/>
<p>I Thank you for your Book: <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> whom you mention in your Book, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been<lb/>
sowing his Tares, Boolimong, and wild <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> in these parts these five weeks<lb/>
without any <normalised orig="controll" auto="true">control</normalised>, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> seduced hundreds, and dipped many in Bocking River<lb/>
and when thats done he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a Feast in the night,<lb/>
and at the end of that the Lords Supper. All opera<lb/>
tenebrarum. No Magistrate in the Country dare<lb/>
meddle with him, for they say they have hunted<lb/>
these out of the country into their Dens in London,<lb/>
and imprisoned some, and they are released, and sent like decoy Ducks into<lb/>
the country to fetch in more; so that they go on in divers parts of Essex with<lb/>
the greatest confidence and <normalised orig="insolencie" auto="true">insolency</normalised> that can be imagined. M. Archer of Halsted<lb/>
preaches boldly against Parliament, Assembly, Directory, <normalised orig="Ministery" auto="true">Ministry</normalised> and all:<lb/>
I pray you let me hear whether there be any hope of light shining out of <normalised orig="darknesse" auto="true">darkness</normalised>.<lb/>
Ellis an Antinomian, brother to Ellis of Colchester the Independent,<lb/>
married a widow, got two hundred pounds of hers, made her <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised><lb/>
would carry her to his friends in the North, but left her by the way, and <normalised orig="ranne" auto="true">ran</normalised><lb/>
away with the two hundred pounds. That miscreant seduced many. Your book<lb/>

<p>Memorandum, that upon the 18. day of Febr. 1645. one Goodwife <normalised orig="Cosens" auto="true">Cousins</normalised><lb/>
of Peters Parish in Colchester brought forth two children both dead, the one a<lb/>
perfect child the other was born without a head, having upon the breast some<lb/>
characters of a face, nose, and eyes, wanting one <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised> and the other <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised> being<lb/>
rather the stump of an <normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised>, ended in a crotch of two fingers, with something<lb/>
like a thumb coming out of one side of it: Downward one of the feet<lb/>
was perfect, the other foot wanted a heel, and had only two toes which grew<lb/>
forward, and another two growing out of one side of it. The Father of this<lb/>
Monster is a Separatist, frequenting their congregations an enemy to the baptising<lb/>
of his own children; the Mother a hearer in the separated congregations<lb/>
likewise, who resolved heretofore, that if ever she had any more children, they<lb/>
should never be <normalised orig="baptized" auto="true">baptised</normalised>. This Relation is affirmed by those of trust and<lb/>
understanding, that saw this Monster, and know the parties.<lb/>

               <p>THe constant practise of many Officers and <normalised orig="souldiers" auto="true">soldiers</normalised> with them, was to <normalised orig="exclaime" auto="true">exclaim</normalised><lb/>

pact to Rome, and their superstitious Steeplehouses<lb/>
<normalised orig="puld" auto="true">pulled</normalised> down to the ground; great variety of opinion was amongst our<lb/>
Officers and <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised>, some affirming that they had had Revelations and seen<lb/>

I never marched where I heard more talk of <normalised orig="godlynesse" auto="true">godliness</normalised>, and <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> practise of<lb/>

HAving had much arguing with him and his adherents in opposition to the<lb/>
Antinomian way, in the morning wherein they seemed to glory much in<lb/>
the <normalised orig="victorie" auto="true">victory</normalised>, though I know no cause for it at all: The Lieutenant came courteously<lb/>
towards even in to my house (as he said) to take his leave of me; which<lb/>
some of his party perceiving, followed him; and others taking notice of their<lb/>
resort, followed also: The subject of our discourse was about the <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> of God<lb/>
revealing himself, and his <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> and will to his servants in reference to their<lb/>
salvation; He affirmed and maintained violently that God did it <normalised orig="immediatly" auto="true">immediately</normalised><lb/>
by himself without Scripture, without Ordinances, Ministers, or any other<lb/>
<normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised>; He being asked about the third Person in the Trinity, <normalised orig="denyed" auto="true">denied</normalised> there<lb/>
was any such thing as a Trinity of persons, but affirmed them to be three Offices;<lb/>
and being demanded what he thought of Christ, whether the <normalised orig="Godhead" auto="true">Godhood</normalised> and<lb/>
manhood were united in one Person in Heaven: He answered only to the last<lb/>
word, and <normalised orig="denyed" auto="true">denied</normalised> that it could be proved by the Scriptures Christs presence<lb/>
in Heaven; and when some Scriptures were produced, which had reference to<lb/>
his Resurrection and <normalised orig="Ascention" auto="true">Ascension</normalised>, he <normalised orig="replyed" auto="true">replied</normalised>, that it was a great question, whether<lb/>
                  <lb/>

                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>

Gentleman had denied the Trinity of persons, and Christs presence in Heaven,<lb/>

THere is one Lawrence Clarkson, a Seeker, spoken of in my Gangræna,<lb/>
<normalised orig="pag" auto="true">page</normalised>. 104, and 105. who put forth a Pamphlet called The Pilgrimage of<lb/>
Saints, wherein are many passages highly derogatory to the Scriptures, denying<lb/>
them to be the rule of a Christian, or that in Doctrine or Practise half of<lb/>
Gods glory was revealed as yet; this man a Taylor and a Blasphemer preached<lb/>
on the Lords day, March eight, at Bow-Church in Cheapside, in the <normalised orig="afternoone" auto="true">afternoon</normalised>:<lb/>
He began his prayer to God, with Right Honourable Lord God, and<lb/>
in his Prayer he prayed that God would <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> the Kings Army, and <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> the<lb/>
Saints both in the Parliaments Army and the Kings, his Sermon was a Rapsody<lb/>
of <normalised orig="nonsence" auto="true">nonsense</normalised>. This was not done in a corner, but in a great and full Audience;<lb/>
there was present at this Sermon one Member of the House of Commons, if<lb/>
not more, besides divers other persons of quality; and thought this Clarkson<lb/>
was in London some time after this, and may be still for ought that I know, yet<lb/>
was he never questioned, nor called to any account for this, or for his Pilgrimage<lb/>
of Saints, as ever I could learn.<lb/>
