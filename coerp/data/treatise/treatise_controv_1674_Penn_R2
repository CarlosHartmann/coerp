               <head>The Second Question stated: Particularly what is meant by Light. <lb/>
It is a Principle that discovers the State of Man, and leads to Blessedness.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
THE second Question runs thus: What is that LIGHT <lb/>
which <normalised orig="leadeth" auto="true">leads</normalised> to Salvation? and if he <normalised orig="pleaseth" auto="true">pleases</normalised> to give <lb/>
me Leave, I will add to this Question, How <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> it <lb/>
Lead to Salvation? <lb/>
By Light I understand not the frequent Metaphorical Use of <lb/>
the Word; as when Christ said <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 5.14"><normalised orig="Ye" auto="true">You</normalised> are the Lights of the World</quote>; <lb/>
or as the Apostle speaks, <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 5.8">Now are you Light in the Lord</quote>; neither <lb/>
the <normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> Spirit or Reason of Man; but, that Glorious <lb/>
Sun of Righteousness, and Heavenly Luminary of the Intellectual or <lb/>
Invisible World, represented of all Outward Resemblances, <lb/>
most exactly by the Great Sun of this Sensible and Visible <lb/>
World, that as his natural Light <normalised orig="ariseth" auto="true">arises</normalised> upon all, and gives <lb/>
Light to all, about the Affairs of this Life; so that Divine <lb/>
Light arises upon all, and gives Light to all, that will receive <lb/>
it, about the Concerns of the other Life: Such a Light I <lb/>
mean by That Light which <normalised orig="inlightneth" auto="false">enlightened</normalised> every man coming <lb/>
into the World, and that <normalised orig="leadeth" auto="true">leads</normalised> those that obey it to Eternal <lb/>
Salvation; The Scripture <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> no less, John 1. In the <lb/>
Word-God was Life, and that (very) Life was the Light of Men, <lb/>
that <normalised orig="inlightneth" auto="false">enlightened</normalised> every man, &amp;c. But to demonstrate it the most <lb/>
obviously that I can, to the lowest Capacities, I shall evidence <lb/>
the Nature and Virtue of this Light by the Holy Effects <lb/>
of it, which is the HOW, or the WHICH WAY it <normalised orig="leadeth" auto="true">leads</normalised> to <lb/>
Salvation: This is so necessary in order to explicate the other, <lb/>
that as the Tree is known by its Fruits, so the True Saviour, <lb/>
by his Salvation. If then I can make it appear, that the <lb/>
Light, as <normalised orig="obey'd" auto="true">obeyed</normalised> in all its Discoveries and Requirings, is sufficient <lb/>
to Salvation, the Debate <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised> end, and T. Hicks must <lb/>
yield to the Efficacy of the Light within. <lb/>
I shall then by the Properties of the Light, prove it Saving: <lb/>
In order to which I shall begin with the first Step towards <lb/>
Salvation, namely, A Sight of the Cause of Damnation; and <lb/>
from whom this most necessary Beginning must be taken, <lb/>
viz. The Light within; which I thus prove by Scripture. <lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>

               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
That the Light Within manifests Sin; yea, all Sin. That <normalised orig="Apostacy" auto="true">Apostasy</normalised>, <lb/>
or Sin in any, is no Argument against the Light, but rather for <lb/>
it. That the Additional Services of the Jews show No Imperfection <lb/>
in the Light, but the People, whose Minds were abroad. <lb/>
If Insufficiency against the Light should be admitted of, because of <lb/>
Rebellion and Wickedness in Men, the same would be objected against <lb/>
the Scriptures, which overthrows our Adversary's Assertion concerning <lb/>
their Sufficiency. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
THE Light, with which Christ <normalised orig="inlightens" auto="false">enlightens</normalised> all Men, <lb/>
manifests Sin, as these Words import; <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 3.20">for every <lb/>
one that <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> Evil <normalised orig="hateth" auto="true">hates</normalised> the Light, neither <lb/>
<normalised orig="cometh" auto="true">comes</normalised> to the Light, lest his Deeds should be Reproved</quote>: <lb/>
Implying, That if they would have brought their Deeds <lb/>
to the Light, the Light would have detected them, and <normalised orig="tryed" auto="true">tried</normalised> <lb/>
them. To which the Apostle Paul bears express Testimony, <lb/>
in his Epistle to the Ephesians, That whatsoever is <lb/>
<notvariant>Reproveable</notvariant> is made Manifest by the Light; where the Universality<lb/>
of the Apostle's Assertion shows, that nothing <lb/>
that is <notvariant>Reproveable</notvariant>, is, or can be excluded from the <lb/>
Search or Knowledge of this Light; which takes in as well <lb/>
Thoughts, as Words and Deeds. So that nothing being <lb/>
<notvariant>Reproveable</notvariant>, which the Light <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not first Manifest: <lb/>
How obvious is it to every Understanding, that if our <lb/>
Adversary <normalised orig="believeth" auto="true">believes</normalised> all Men to have committed Sin, <lb/>
and so, as that they know it (which is <notvariant>Reproveable</notvariant>) the <lb/>
Light must needs have been, and be in all Men, in order to <lb/>
such Manifestation and Conviction. It is as much as if the <lb/>
Apostle had said, Sin is that which Damns all Men; now <lb/>
it could not Damn, if it were not <notvariant>Reproveable</notvariant>, and it could <lb/>
never be <notvariant>Reproveable</notvariant>, if the Light did not Manifest and <lb/>
Condemn it as such. So that our Adversaries affirming <lb/>
the Light not to be Sufficient to Discern all Sin, is a flat Repugnancy, <lb/>
and a down-right giving of the <normalised orig="Lye" auto="true">Lie</normalised> to the Apostle; <lb/>
For says the Apostle, <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 5.13">All things that are <notvariant>Reproveable</notvariant>, <lb/>
are made Manifest by the Light</quote>. But <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> Tho. Hicks, All <lb/>
things that are <notvariant>Reproveable</notvariant>, are not made Manifest by the Light. <lb/>
Sober Reader, dwell here a while, and after a little paws <lb/>
tell me, Who deals most Unworthily with the Apostle and the Holy <lb/>
Scriptures of Truth, T. Hicks or the Quakers?<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="14">K</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
Obj. But T. Hicks objects, with some others, <lb/>
If there be that Light in all Men, how comes it, that <lb/>
all Men are not Convicted of their Disobedience and <lb/>
Duty, as the Heathens of old, and many Infidels at <lb/>
this day? Did the Light in Saul reprove him for Persecuting <lb/>
the Church? <lb/>
                  <lb/>
I Answer, That this no way impugnes the Light, although <lb/>
it greatly aggravates their Evil that so <normalised orig="Rebell'd" auto="true">Rebelled</normalised> against it. <lb/>
But that there were Heathens, who became a Law unto <lb/>
themselves, through that Light they had, by which they <lb/>
did the things contained in the Law, and were preferred far before <lb/>
the Circumcision that kept not the Law: The Apostle Paul himself <lb/>
is very express in that known Passage to the Romans. <lb/>
Nor are other Histories silent, but loud in their acknowledgment <lb/>
of very Divine Attainments, which, by this <lb/>
Light several Famous Gentiles arrived at; and for their <lb/>
Belief of One Eternal Being, his Communication of Divine <lb/>
Light to Men, and of an Immortality, with their <normalised orig="Strickt" auto="true">Strict</normalised> Conformity <lb/>
thereto, are left upon Record. by Credible Historians; <lb/>
and their Praises not a little added to by after <lb/>
Ages, even of those called Christians too. Such are Reputed, <lb/>
Pythagoras, Timæus, Solon, Bias, Chilon, Anaxagoras, <lb/>
Socrates, Plato, Antistbenes, Xenocrates, Zeno, Antipater, <lb/>
Seneca, Epictetus, and others. <lb/>
But what if Jews and Gentiles at any time did Apostatize, <lb/>
and particularly? What if Saul persecuted the Church <lb/>
of God, putting Disobedience for Duty, Murder for Service? <lb/>
Will it follow, that the Light was Insufficient? By no <lb/>
means; but rather that Saul was Rebellious, Stiff-necked, <lb/>
Resisting the Holy Ghost; as did his Fathers, so did <lb/>
he; and thus much the Words themselves show; for <lb/>
he <normalised orig="kickt" auto="true">kicked</normalised> against the Pricks. Then it seems there were <lb/>
Pricks; And where were they, if not in his Conscience? <lb/>
And what were they, if not the Light of Christ <lb/>
within him, which Manifests Evil, and Reproves the Deeds <lb/>
thereof: otherwise called the Son of God, that to the <lb/>
Galatians he said, It had pleased God to reveal in him? though <lb/>
Paul knew him not, nor his Voice of a long time; his Eye <lb/>
being darkened, and Ear <normalised orig="stopt" auto="true">stopped</normalised> by the God of this <lb/>
World, who had crept into the Outward Forms of Religion, <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="15">14</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
then, as now, and in that <normalised orig="employ'd" auto="true">employed</normalised> many Emissaries <lb/>
to decry that Pure, Heavenly and Invisible Life of Truth and<lb/>
Righteousness, which was then, and is now begotten in <lb/>
the Hearts of many, to the ending of the Idolatries <lb/>
of the Gentiles, and Formality and Outward Services of <lb/>
both Jews and Carnal Christians.<lb/>
And I affirm in the Name of God, and with the Reason <lb/>
of a Man, That it is most preposterously absurd, for any to <lb/>
charge the Rebellion of Men, to be Insufficiency in the Light: <lb/>
For if men are Wicked, not because they will not be <lb/>
better; but because they neither see nor know, nor are<lb/>
able to do better; How Heavy, how Black, and how Blasphemous <lb/>
a Character <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> the Consequence of these <normalised orig="Mens" auto="true">Men's</normalised> Opinion <lb/>
fasten upon the Righteous God of Heaven and <lb/>
Earth; since it supposes him, Not to have given either Inwardly <lb/>
or Outwardly unto Men Means sufficient to do that which <lb/>
he requires from them; and for the not doing of which, <lb/>
they are to be sentenced to Eternal Misery. But I confess, <lb/>
How deep <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised> this may stick with Impartial Spirits, <lb/>
I almost despair of entering our Adversaries, whose Souls <lb/>
are <normalised orig="pinch'd" auto="true">pinched</normalised> up within the narrow Compass of a most <lb/>
Detestable Kind of Predestination, making the Eternal God, <lb/>
as Partial as themselves, like some Ancients, That because <lb/>
they could not Resemble God, they would make such Gods <lb/>
as might Resemble them.<lb/>
I say, what else can be the tendency of this kind of <lb/>
Doctrine against the Sufficiency of the Light Within, then <lb/>
that the Gift of God is not Perfect, or able, because Men don't <lb/>
Obey it: and that the Talent God has given to all, is <lb/>
therefore Insufficient for the End for which it was given, because <lb/>
Man hides it in a Napkin? <lb/>
Again, Let them tell me, Would it be a good Argument, <lb/>
that if the same Corn should be sown in a Fertile <lb/>
and Barren <normalised orig="Soile" auto="true">Soil</normalised>, that growing in one, and not in the <lb/>
other, the Fault should be in the Seed, and not rather in the <lb/>
Ground? <lb/>
Who knows not, how Tradition and Custom have <lb/>
eaten out much of Conviction, blinded the World, and <lb/>
that it is through Lusts and Pleasures become <normalised orig="stupified" auto="true">stupefied</normalised>, <lb/>
as to the Invisible Things of God. Alas! there had never <lb/>
been so much Need of many <normalised orig="Exteriour" auto="true">Exterior</normalised> Dispensations <lb/>
and Appearances in reference to Religion, so much <lb/>
preferred by the Professors of this Day, had not <normalised orig="Mens" auto="true">Men's</normalised> <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="16">K 2</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
Minds been departed from the Inward Light and Life <lb/>
of Righteousness; so that they being abroad, God was <lb/>
pleased to meet them there with some External Manifestations,<lb/>
yet so, as to turn them home again to their first Love, <lb/>
to that Light and Life, which was given of God, as the <lb/>
Way to Eternal Salvation: Nor could any of those <lb/>
cleanse, as concerning the Conscience; wherefore God <lb/>
still, by his Servants and Prophets, admonished and <lb/>
warned the People of Old, To Put Away the Evil of their <lb/>
Doings, and to Wash themselves, and to Cleanse themselves; <lb/>
for that all their Exactness in Outward Services, was otherwise but <lb/>
as the Cutting off a Dog's Neck, a Sacrifice equally pleasing: <lb/>
wherefore the Abrogation of all Outward Dispensations, <lb/>
and Reducing Man to his first State of Inward <lb/>
Light and Righteousness, is called in Scripture, The <lb/>
Times of Refreshment, and of the Restitution of all things. <lb/>
In short, Though there have been External Observations, <lb/>
and Ordinances in the World, by God's appointment; <lb/>
either to prevent the Jews from the Outward <lb/>
splendid Worship of the Idolatrous Gentiles, that he might retain <lb/>
a Peculiar <normalised orig="Soveraignity" auto="true">Sovereignty</normalised> over them; or to show forth unto <lb/>
them a more Hidden and Invisible Glory; this remains sure <lb/>
forever, That Light there was, and that the Ancients saw <lb/>
their Sins by it, and that there could be no Acceptance with God, <lb/>
but as they <normalised orig="walk'd" auto="true">walked</normalised> up to it, and were taught to put away the Evil <lb/>
of their Doings by it; suitable to that Notable Passage, <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 4.18">The Path of the Just is a shining Light</quote>, that shines clearer and<lb/>
clearer unto the Perfect Day. What was this Day, but <normalised orig="compleat" auto="true">complete</normalised> <lb/>
Salvation? Can there be any Imperfection or Darkness <lb/>
in the Day? Surely no. What if their Light was <lb/>
not so large? Was it not therefore Saving? Yes surely. <lb/>
But as where much is given, much is required; so where <lb/>
little is given, but little is required. If the Light was <lb/>
not so Gloriously manifested before the coming of our Lord <lb/>
Jesus Christ in the Flesh, less was then required at that time, <lb/>
then since; yet it follows not, that there was Two Lights, <lb/>
or that the Light was not Saving before the Visible Appearance of <lb/>
Christ, to as many as lived in an Holy Conformity to it. <lb/>
And if it be agreed, that Blindness in Men can be <lb/>
no Argument against the Light of the Sun; neither is the <lb/>
Light Insufficient, because the People of any Nation remain Blind <lb/>
through their Vain Customs: Nay, should any such Doctrine <lb/>
be admitted, what would become of our Adversary's Opinion, <lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
That the Light of Scripture is Sufficient of it self to give <lb/>
Men the Knowledge of God? For if those People, who have <lb/>
the Scriptures, do not so Know, Believe and Obey God, <lb/>
as T. Hicks says, they ought to do; will it not follow <lb/>
upon his Principles, that the Defect is not in such, as if <lb/>
they were Ignorant and Rebellious, but in the Scriptures? Certainly <lb/>
the Consequence will hold as well against the Scriptures, <lb/>
as the Light: If then such wrong the Scriptures, <lb/>
who so dispute, Let T. Hicks, I <normalised orig="intreat" auto="true">entreat</normalised> him, endeavour to <lb/>
Right the Light, and not longer maintain a Position, that <lb/>
being admitted, would equally overturn his Notion of the Scriptures, <lb/>
without Belief of the Light Within. <lb/>

                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Another Objection against the Lights Sufficiency to manifest what ought to <lb/>
be done, though it were able to discover what should be avoided. It is <lb/>
<normalised orig="answerd" auto="true">answered</normalised>. The Lights not telling man all it knows, or man may know in <lb/>
time to come, is no Argument to prove it knows not all things. Men know <lb/>
more than they do, let them first Obey what they know, and then what <lb/>
is convenient will be further <normalised orig="Reveal'd" auto="true">Revealed</normalised>. It is proved from the <lb/>
Reason of Contraries; because it shows what ought not to be done: <lb/>
From Scripture at large, that it does instruct what to do; And that <lb/>
there is <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised> in it to the Salvation of all that Believe and Obey it. <lb/>
That there is no Essential Difference between the Seed, Light, Word, <lb/>
Spirit, Life, Truth, Power, <normalised orig="Vnction" auto="true">Unction</normalised>, Bread, Water, Flesh and <lb/>
Blood; <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> so denominated from the various Manifestations, <lb/>
Operations, and Effects of one and the same Divine Principle. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
BUt there is a Second Objection; That there <lb/>
seems to be a manifest Insufficiency in the Light: <lb/>
For, though several things are Revealed by it, yet several <lb/>
necessary matters are not, nor cannot; So that though it <lb/>
should manifest all that is <notvariant>Reproveable</notvariant>, yet cannot it Discover <lb/>
all that is Necessary to be either Believed or Done. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
I Answer, this is but a <normalised orig="peece" auto="true">piece</normalised> of the former Objection <lb/>
already considered; I perceive the Pinch lies here; that <lb/>
because Men do not Do what they should, or don't Know all that may <lb/>
be Necessary to be known, therefore the Light is insufficient. <lb/>
The first will be <normalised orig="answer'd" auto="true">answered</normalised> by what I have already said; the <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="18">L</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
Reason being the same for the Sufficiency of the Light, against <lb/>
such as charge it with Defect, because they do not do <lb/>
what they should, as against those who so impeach it, because they do <lb/>
those things which they should not. As for not knowing all that <lb/>
is to be known, I deny it utterly, For things are necessary <lb/>
in reference to their proper times; That may be <normalised orig="requisit" auto="true">requisite</normalised> to morrow <lb/>
which is not to day. It is fit for Children to learn to read, <lb/>
yet it is most necessary, that they should begin to spell first. If <lb/>
a School-Master should be <normalised orig="charg'd" auto="true">charged</normalised> with <choice ana="print-error">

                  </choice>, because <lb/>
he tells not little Children, all that he knows, as soon as <lb/>
he initiates them in the first Principles of Learning, he would <lb/>
think himself unreasonably dealt with. What must we <lb/>
then conclude, but that the Master may be very capable, <lb/>
were his Scholar so? that if the Scholar observe and obey his <lb/>
Master, he will increase in his Learning, that the Defect of the <lb/>
Scholar should not be laid upon his Master; that to tell or amuse <lb/>
him about things unsuitable to his present Capacity, were <lb/>
the ready Way to overcharge and <normalised orig="wholy" auto="true">wholly</normalised> <normalised orig="Spoile" auto="true">Spoil</normalised> him: And Consequently <lb/>
that the Tutor, not telling his Pupil, all that is fit to <lb/>
be known, at once, <normalised orig="implyes" auto="true">implies</normalised> no Defect in, or Ignorance of those things <lb/>
in the Tutor; which to apply Scripturally, in short thus: <lb/>
If you do my Will, you shall know (more)of my Doctrine; <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 16.12">I have <lb/>
yet many things to say, but you are not able to bear them now.</quote> In <lb/>
short, If for a Man to say that the Light of the Gospel (for <lb/>
so T. Hicks thinks Pauls was) to be <normalised orig="charg'd" auto="true">charged</normalised> with Insufficiency, <lb/>
because it <normalised orig="discover'd" auto="true">discovered</normalised> not to every Believer, all those ineffable <lb/>
things, revealed to the Apostle, would be both False and <lb/>
Antichristian; to what an Extremity <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> Tho. Hicks's Zeal <lb/>
lead him in his passionate Endeavours against the blessed <lb/>
Light of the Son of God as he is the Inlightner of Mankind, <lb/>
who charges it with Insufficiency, because it Reveals not to every <lb/>
Individual, in every Age, what HE shall ever know it self, or <lb/>
shall be known in future times. The Light then is not Insufficient, <lb/>
though it tell not all at one time, which may be <lb/>
a Duty to the End of the World; especially in extraordinary <lb/>
Cases, whilst it informs me, or any Man, of Daily <lb/>
Duty. Yea, the Light is Sufficient in Point of Discovery, <lb/>
whilst it <normalised orig="shews" auto="true">shows</normalised> unto any Person something more, then <lb/>
they do, and which they ought to perform. If T. Hicks <lb/>
will say, and can prove, that he is come to the Upshot of the <lb/>
Light's Teachings, that he has Learnt whatever it is possible for <lb/>
the Light of Christ to Teach him, and yet is able to make appear, <lb/>
that there is some thing further wanting, he will <lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
prove himself not only above Men, but God also, who is <lb/>
the Fountain of all Light; that <normalised orig="searcheth" auto="true">searches</normalised> the Hearts, and <normalised orig="tryeth" auto="true">tries</normalised> <lb/>
the Reins of Men by the Inshinings of his manifesting Light, and <lb/>
which, as <normalised orig="obey'd" auto="true">obeyed</normalised>, leads to God, who is the <normalised orig="Fulness" auto="true">Fullness</normalised> of all <lb/>
Light and Life: But indeed, this Light is the Savour of <lb/>
Death (the Wages of Sin) to all that Rebel against it, and <lb/>
the Savour of Life to those only, who are Obedient to it; For, <lb/>
Such shall not walk in Darkness, but have the Light of Life. <lb/>
But, whilst he pleads against a Sin-less State, and shows so <lb/>
Sin-full an One in his Scribes, let him cover his Face for <lb/>
Shame, for all his Attempts against the Lights Sufficiency; <lb/>
for in that State he shall never know the Life and <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised> <lb/>
of the Light. <lb/>
To conclude, If the Light be allowed to Manifest all <lb/>
things that are <notvariant>Reproveable</notvariant>, then by the just Reason of Contraries, <lb/>
should it be Sufficient to Discover all things that are <normalised orig="Approveable" auto="true">Approvable</normalised>, <lb/>
with respect to Man's Faith, Salvation and Duty. If the <lb/>
Light tells it is Evil, not to Believe in God, it follows, <lb/>
that to Believe in God, is according to that Light Within. <lb/>
And if it Reproves T. Hicks for being Passionate, it consequently <lb/>
<normalised orig="Teacheth" auto="true">Teaches</normalised> him, that he ought to be Patient: If the Light <lb/>
Condemns Theft, it necessarily <normalised orig="Instructeth" auto="true">Instructs</normalised> to Honesty: If it <lb/>
Reprove me for doing my own Will, it implies I ought to do <lb/>
his Will to whom I ow all: and if it Reproves for Sin, it <normalised orig="Instructeth" auto="true">Instructs</normalised> <lb/>
to Holiness, without which none shall see God. In <lb/>
short, If it Manifest <notvariant>Reproveable</notvariant> Things to be such, at <lb/>
the same time It Condemns them, and <normalised orig="Teacheth" auto="true">Teaches</normalised> Things quite <lb/>
Contrary; The Unfruitful Works of Darkness are <normalised orig="judg'd" auto="true">judged</normalised> by <lb/>
the Light, that the Holy Fruits of the Light may appear: <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 5.8"><normalised orig="Ye" auto="true">You</normalised> <lb/>
were Darkness, but now are <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> Light in the Lord</quote>; and The <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 6.23">Reproof of Instruction is the Way of Life</quote>. He that comes out <lb/>
of the Reproved Darkness, walks in the Approved Light; and <lb/>
who so answers the Holy Reproof, unto Such is Sealed up <lb/>
THE INSTRUCTION OF THE WAY OF LIFE. <lb/>
And this brings me to the third Property of the Light, <lb/>
with respect to Men; and that is, It <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not only Manifest <lb/>
and Condemn Sin, and discover and incline to Purity; but <lb/>
as adhered to (or rather that Principle which is this Light) <lb/>
it is able, in Point of Power and Efficacy to Redeem from Sin, and <lb/>
Lead to a State of Highest Felicity. <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 8.12">I am the Light of the World</quote>, <lb/>
(said Jesus himself) <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 8.12">he that follows me shall not walk in Darkness, <lb/>
but shall have the Light of Life</quote>. In which it is very <lb/>
evident, that, The same Light, which Manifests Darkness, Redeems <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="20">L 2</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
from it, unto a State of Light and Life: that is to say, <lb/>
Those who confidently believe in Christ, as he manifests <lb/>
himself a Light, to condemn Sin in every mans Flesh <lb/>
(whom he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> therefore illuminated)and obediently <lb/>
follow the Holy Requirings, and yield to the Heavenly <lb/>
Discoveries of that Blessed Appearance, relinquishing <lb/>
the Pleasures of Sin, which last but for a season, and taking <lb/>
up the daily Cross; such shall most assuredly find <lb/>
that Divine Principle, which in reference to the Dark State <lb/>
of Men, and the Discerning and Conviction it brings, is <lb/>
rightly denominated Light, to have also Power and Efficacy, to <lb/>
Save from that which it manifests and condemns, and to <lb/>
bring unto that Glory, which it gives a true Revelation <lb/>
of:  For, that same Word of God, who is called the true <lb/>
Light that <normalised orig="inlighteneth" auto="false">enlightened</normalised> all Mankind, is also the Life, Power, Wisdom <lb/>
and Righteousness of the Father, in whom are hid all the <lb/>
Treasures of Wisdom, and unto whom all Power both in Heaven <lb/>
and in Earth are committed, who is Heir of all things: who also <lb/>
said, While <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> have the Light(for their Day of Visitation <lb/>
was almost over) or, as some Translations more <lb/>
truly have it, While you have a little Light IN YOU, <lb/>
believe, or walk in it.) <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 12.36">believe in the Light, that <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> may <lb/>
be Children of the Light</quote>: Again, <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 12.46">I am come a Light into the <lb/>
World, that whosoever believes in me should not abide in Darkness</quote>: <lb/>
So that a Sincere Faith in, and Obedience to the Light of <lb/>
Christ, as it shines in the Heart, whereby to give the <lb/>
Living and Experimental Knowledge of the Glory of <lb/>
God unto the Creature, is the Way to be Redeemed <lb/>
from Darkness, and to be made a Child of Light; or <lb/>
that there is Power and <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised> Sufficient in the Light, to Ransom <lb/>
the Souls of such as diligently adhere to it, from under the Power <lb/>
of Darkness. For as the true Knowledge of God is Life <lb/>
Eternal, so, whatever may be known of God is manifested within, <lb/>
which Manifestation cannot properly be without the <lb/>
Light, whose peculiar Property it is to Discover, Reveal or Manifest <lb/>
the Mind and Will of God to Mankind; as saith the Apostle, <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 5.13">For whatsoever <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> make Manifest is Light.</quote>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 1.4">In him was<lb/>
Life, and that Life was the Light of all Men</quote>: But not therefore <lb/>
the Life of all Men, Spiritually and Unitedly considered; <lb/>
That was the peculiar <normalised orig="Priviledge" auto="true">Privilege</normalised> of those who <normalised orig="Believ'd" auto="true">Believed</normalised> <lb/>
in it, and <normalised orig="walkt" auto="true">walked</normalised> up to it. There is a great Difference, <lb/>
not in the Principle, but in its Appearance to Man, as <lb/>
Life, and Light. Such as believe in it; IT, What? the <lb/>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
Word-God, who is that true Light, as he appears to Discover <lb/>
or Illuminate the Heart and Conscience, do really <lb/>
know and enjoy a new Nature, Spirit and Life; And <lb/>
in that Sense it may be said, As the Life became the Light, <lb/>
so the Light became the Life again. Who so follows me shall <lb/>
not walk in Darkness, but have the Light of Life. Not, <lb/>
that there is a Difference, or so much as a Descent in <lb/>
Kind from Life to Light; only in Operation with respect <lb/>
to Man: For as it is the very Life of the Word, in <lb/>
the Word, it is the Light of Men: and so much it is, <lb/>
let them reject the <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised> of it, if they will; But as <lb/>
it is received, and believed in, It begets Life, Motion, Heat, <lb/>
and every Divine Qualification, suitable to the State of the <lb/>
New Birth. And thus the Life of the Word, which is in <lb/>
common the Light, becomes the Life of every such Particular, <lb/>
by communicating to, or ingenerating Life in the <lb/>
Soul; so that no more he lives, but Christ (the Word-God, <lb/>
whom he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> now put on, and who is become his <lb/>
very Life, as well as Light) that <normalised orig="dwelleth" auto="true">dwells</normalised> in him.<lb/>
Let not Men then in their Dark Imaginations, with <lb/>
their <normalised orig="Rob'd" auto="true">Robbed</normalised> Knowledge from the Letter of the Scriptures <lb/>
themselves, contend against the Sufficiency of what they <lb/>
obey not; neither have seriously <normalised orig="tryed" auto="true">tried</normalised> the Power, <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised>, <lb/>
and Efficacy of it, which brings Salvation to as many as are <lb/>
turned to it, and abide in it.<lb/>
And indeed, so express are the Scriptures in Defence <lb/>
of the Sufficiency, and Necessity of the Light to Salvation, <lb/>
that it seems to have been the great Intendment of <lb/>
our Lord Jesus Christ in delegating his Disciples, to preach <lb/>
his Everlasting Gospel, viz. That they might open the Eyes of <lb/>
People, and turn them from Darkness to the Light, and from the <lb/>
Power of Satan unto God, that they might receive Remission of <lb/>
Sins, and an Inheritance among them that are Sanctified through <lb/>
Faith, that is in Me; who, ME? that am both the Light of the <lb/>
World, and the Power of God unto Salvation. Now certainly, <lb/>
the Eyes that were then blind, were not the Natural, <lb/>
but Spiritual Eyes of Men(and such must the Darkness <lb/>
and Light be also) blinded by the God of this World, <lb/>
who <normalised orig="raigned" auto="true">reigned</normalised> in the Hearts of the Children of Disobedience: <lb/>
No Wonder then if the Light was not comprehended of <lb/>
the Darkness, and that blind People did not see the Light; <lb/>
but it plainly proves, That Light there was, though not seen. <lb/>
Now the Work of the Powerful Ministry of the Apostles <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="22">M</fw>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
was, To open the Blind or Dark Eye, which the God of the <lb/>
World had blinded, and then to turn them from that Darkness, to <lb/>
the Light; the Darkness was within, so must the Light have <lb/>
been; since the Illumination was there necessary, where <lb/>
the Darkness had been predominant; Consequently, The Way to <lb/>
be Translated from Satan's Power to God, to have Remission of <lb/>
Sins, and an Inheritance with them that are Sanctified, is, to be <lb/>
turned from the Darkness in the Heart, unto the <normalised orig="Marvelous" auto="true">Marvellous</normalised> Light <lb/>
(that had long shined uncomprehended) to wit, the GOSPEL, <lb/>
which is called both the Light and Power of God. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
The same Apostle in his Epistle to the Romans, is more <lb/>
express concerning the holy Nature and Efficacy of the <lb/>
Light to Salvation, when he thus exhorts them; <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 13.12-14">The Night <lb/>
is far spent, the Day is at hand; Let us therefore cast off the Works <lb/>
of Darkness, and put on the Armour of Light: Let us walk honestly <lb/>
as in the Day, not in Rioting and Drunkenness, not in Chambring <lb/>
and Wantonness, not in Strife and Envy; but put <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> on the Lord <lb/>
Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the Flesh, to <normalised orig="fulfill" auto="true">fulfil</normalised> the Lusts <lb/>
thereof.</quote> From whence I shall briefly remark three Things,<lb/>
greatly to our Purpose, and the Truths Defence in this <lb/>
Matter.<lb/>
1. That there is an absolute Opposition, betwixt Light and <lb/>
Darkness; as Darkness can only Vail the Light, from the <lb/>
Understandings of Men; So Light only can Discover and Dispel <lb/>
that Darkness. Or thus, That the Light Manifests and Condemns <lb/>
the Works of Darkness; for, what Communion <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> Light with <lb/>
Darkness. <lb/>
2. That in the Light there is ARMOUR, which being put <lb/>
on, is able to Conquer the Darkness, and Secure the <lb/>
Soul, from the evil of it; otherwise it would be very <lb/>
strange, that the Apostle should exhort the People to put <lb/>
it on.<lb/>
3. That putting on the Armour of the Light, and putting <lb/>
on the Lord Jesus Christ (the Light of the World) are <lb/>
<normalised orig="Synonimous" auto="true">Synonymous</normalised>, or one and the same thing; for it is for one <lb/>
and the same End, as may be observed from the Words, <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 13.12">Let us put on the Armour of Light</quote>, and <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 13.13-14">walk Honestly, as in the <lb/>
Day, not in Rioting and Drunkenness, not in Chambring and <lb/>
Wantonness, not in Strife and Envying.<lb/>
But put <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for <lb/>
the Flesh, to fulfil the Lusts thereof.</quote>
                  <lb/>
I hope then, Neither will it be <normalised orig="disallow'd" auto="true">disallowed</normalised>, that Christ <lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
is that Light, with which Men are <normalised orig="Inlightned" auto="false">Enlightened</normalised>, (but more of <lb/>
that anon) nor is that Light, Men are exhorted to Obey, <lb/>
a Naked and Insufficient, but a Searching, Expelling, Powerful <lb/>
and Arming Light, against Darkness, and all its Unfruitful <lb/>
Works, and consequently SAVING.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Thus the Beloved Disciple testifies very emphatically, <lb/>
in his first Epistle, where he gives us a Relation of the Apostolical <lb/>
Mission: <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Jn 1.5-7">This then is the Message which we have <lb/>
heard of him, and declare unto you; That God is Light, and in <lb/>
him is no Darkness at all; if we say, we have Fellowship with <lb/>
him, and walk in Darkness, we <normalised orig="Lye" auto="true">Lie</normalised>, and do not the Truth; But if <lb/>
we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have Fellowship <lb/>
one with another, and the Blood of Jesus Christ his Son <normalised orig="cleanseth" auto="true">cleanses</normalised> <lb/>
us from all Sin.</quote>
                  <lb/>
Here is a brief Stating of the whole Great Case of Salvation: <lb/>
(1.)  What God is; Light. (2.) Who can have no <lb/>
Fellowship with him; such as walk in Darkness (that is Sin.) <lb/>
(3.) Who have Fellowship with him; such as walk in the <lb/>
Light, as he is Light. (4.) the Reason why, is given; because <lb/>
such as walk in the Light, are there sure experimentally <lb/>
to feel the <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised> of Christ's Blood, to cleanse them from all Unrighteousness; <lb/>
Where observe, that the Light's leading out <lb/>
of Darkness, that is, Unrighteousness, is the same with the <lb/>
Blood of Jesus Christ cleansing from all Sin; Sin and Darkness, <lb/>
and to be cleansed from the one, and to be translated from the other, <lb/>
is equivalent; otherwise, a Man might be delivered from <lb/>
Darkness, and walk in the Light, and not be cleansed from <lb/>
Sin, which is that Darkness; a thing Absurd and Impossible: In <lb/>
short, they go together.<lb/>
By this <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> evident, that the Light being <normalised orig="walkt" auto="true">walked</normalised> in, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <lb/>
directly lead to God, and Fellowship with him, who is the <lb/>
Saving Light and Health of all Nations; and consequently,<lb/>
that the Light leads to Eternal Salvation. <lb/>
Many are the Denominations that are given in Scripture <lb/>
to one and the same Being, or Condition; Christ is called, The <lb/>
Word, the Light, the Saviour, Emmanuel, a Rock, a Door, a Vine, a <lb/>
Shepherd, &amp;c. A State of Sin is sometimes called, Darkness, <lb/>
Death, Disobedience, Barrenness, Rebellion, Stiff-neckedness, <lb/>
Eating of <normalised orig="Sowr" auto="true">Sour</normalised> Grapes; And Wicked Men, <normalised orig="Bryars" auto="true">Briars</normalised>, <lb/>
Thorns, Thistles, Tares, Dead Trees, Wolves, Goats, &amp;c. On <lb/>
the contrary, a State of Conversion, is sometimes expressed, <lb/>
by such words, as, Purged, Refined, Washed, Cleansed, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="24">M 2</fw>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
Sanctified, Justified, Led by the Spirit, <normalised orig="Baptized" auto="true">Baptised</normalised> by one Spirit <lb/>
into one Body, Regenerated, Redeemed, Saved, Bought with a <lb/>
Price, &amp;c. And Persons so qualified, The Children of God, <lb/>
Children of Light, Heirs of Glory, Lambs, Sheep, Wheat; And <lb/>
that by which they became or continued thus, Light, Spirit, <lb/>
Fire, Sword, Hammer, Power, Grace, Seed, Truth, Way, Life, <lb/>
Blood, Water, Bread, Word, Unction, that <normalised orig="leadeth" auto="true">leads</normalised> into all <lb/>
Truth; All which respectively, is but one and the same <lb/>
in Nature: That is, Sin or a Sinful State is so variously denominated <lb/>
from the divers Operations and Discoveries of the Nature of <lb/>
it in Wicked Men. <lb/>
