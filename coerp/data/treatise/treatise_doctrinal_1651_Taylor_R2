Consideration of the miseries of <lb/>
Mans life.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
AS our life is very short so it is very miserable, <lb/>
and therefore it is well it is <lb/>
short: God in pity to <normalised orig="mankinde" auto="true">mankind</normalised>, left his <lb/>
burden should be insupportable and his nature <lb/>
an intolerable load, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> reduced our state <lb/>
of misery to an abbreviature; and the greater <lb/>
our misery is, the <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> while it is like to last; <lb/>
the sorrows of a mans spirit being like ponderous <lb/>
weights which by the <normalised orig="greatnesse" auto="true">greatness</normalised> of <lb/>
their burden make a swifter motion and descend <lb/>
into the grave to rest and ease our wearied <lb/>
limbs; for then <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> we shall sleep <lb/>
quietly when those fetters are knocked off <lb/>
which not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> bound our souls in prison, <lb/>
but also eat the flesh till the very bones <normalised orig="open'd" auto="true">opened</normalised> <lb/>
the secret garments of their cartilages, discovering <lb/>
their <normalised orig="nakednesse" auto="true">nakedness</normalised> and sorrow. <lb/>
12. Here is no place to sit down in, but you <lb/>
must rise as soon as you are set: for we have <lb/>
gnats in our chambers, and worms in our <lb/>
gardens, and spiders and flies in the palaces of <lb/>
the greatest Kings. How few men in the world <lb/>
are prosperous? what an infinite number of <lb/>
slaves and <normalised orig="beggers" auto="true">beggars</normalised>, of persecuted and oppressed <lb/>
people fill all corners of the earth <lb/>
with groans, and Heaven it self with weeping <lb/>
prayers, and sad remembrances? how many <lb/>
Provinces and Kingdoms are afflicted by a <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="36">C 6</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
violent war, or made desolate by popular diseases? <lb/>
some whole <normalised orig="countreyes" auto="true">countries</normalised> are remarked <lb/>
with fatal evils, or periodical sicknesses. Gran <lb/>
Cairo in Egypt feels the plague every three <lb/>
years, returning like a <normalised orig="Quartan" auto="true">Quart</normalised> ague, and destroying <lb/>
many thousands of persons. All the <lb/>
inhabitants of Arabia the desert are in <normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised> <lb/>
fear of being buried in huge heaps of <lb/>
sand, and therefore dwell in tents and ambulatory <lb/>
houses or retire to unfruitful mountains <lb/>
to prolong an uneasy and wilder life: and all <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Countreyes" auto="true">Countries</normalised> round about the Adriatic <lb/>
sea feel such violent convulsions by Tempests <lb/>
and intolerable Earthquakes, that sometimes <lb/>
whole cities find a <normalised orig="Tombe" auto="true">Tomb</normalised>, and every man <lb/>
sinks with his own house made ready to become <lb/>
his Monument, and his bed is crushed <lb/>
into the disorders of a grave. Was not all the <lb/>
world drowned at one deluge, and breach of <lb/>
the Divine anger? and <lb/>
shall not all the world again <lb/>
be destroyed by fire? <lb/>
Are there not many thousands <lb/>
that die every night, <lb/>
and that groan and weep <lb/>
sadly every day? But what shall we think of <lb/>
the great evil, which for the sins of men, God <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> suffered to possess the greatest part of <lb/>
<normalised orig="Mankinde" auto="true">Mankind</normalised>? Most of the men that are now <lb/>
alive, or that have been living for many ages, <lb/>
are Jews, Heathens, or Turcs: and God was <lb/>
pleased to suffer a base Epileptic person, a <lb/>
villain and a <normalised orig="vitious" auto="true">vicious</normalised> to set up a religion which <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> filled almost all Asia, and Africa, and some <lb/>
parts of Europe; so that the greatest number <lb/>
of men and women born in so many kingdoms <lb/>
and provinces are infallibly made Mahumetans, <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="37">36</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
strangers and enemies to Christ, <lb/>
by whom alone we can be saved. This consideration <lb/>
is extremely sad, when we remember <lb/>
how universal, and how great an evil it is, that <lb/>
so many millions of sons and daughters are <lb/>
born to enter into the possession of Devils to <lb/>
eternal ages. These evils are the miseries of <lb/>
great parts of <normalised orig="mankinde" auto="true">mankind</normalised>, and we cannot easily <lb/>
consider more particularly, the evils which <lb/>
happen to us, being the inseparable affections, <lb/>
or incidents to the whole nature of man. <lb/>
2. We <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> that all the women in the world <lb/>
are either born for <normalised orig="barrennesse" auto="true">barrenness</normalised> or the pains of <lb/>
Child-birth, and yet this is one of our greatest <lb/>
blessings; but such indeed are the blessings of <lb/>
this world: we cannot be well with, nor without <lb/>
many things. Perfumes make our heads <normalised orig="ake" auto="true">ache</normalised>, <lb/>
roses prick our fingers, and in our very blood <lb/>
where our life dwells is the Scene under which <lb/>
nature acts many sharp <normalised orig="Feavers" auto="true">Fevers</normalised> and heavy <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*cknesses</sic>
                     <corr>sicknesses</corr>
                  </choice>. <lb/>
It were too sad if I should tell how many <lb/>
persons are afflicted with evil spirits, with spectres <lb/>
and illusions of the night; and that huge <lb/>
multitudes of men and women live upon mans <lb/>
flesh: Nay worse yet, upon the sins of men, upon <lb/>
the sins of their sons and of their daughters, <lb/>
and they pay their souls down for the bread <lb/>
they eat, buying this <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> meal with the price <lb/>
of the last nights sin. <lb/>
3. Or if you please in charity to visit an <lb/>
Hospital, which is indeed a map of the whole <lb/>
world, there you shall see the effects of Adams <lb/>
sin and the <normalised orig="ruines" auto="true">ruins</normalised> of humane nature, bodies <lb/>
laid up in heaps like the bones of a destroyed <lb/>
town, homines precarii spiritus &amp; male haerentis, <lb/>
men whose souls seem to be borrowed, and are <lb/>
kept there by art and the force of Medicine; <lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
whose miseries are so great, that few people <lb/>
have charity or humanity enough to visit <lb/>
them, fewer have the heart to <normalised orig="dresse" auto="true">dress</normalised> them, <lb/>
and we pity them in civility or with a transient <lb/>
prayer, but we do not feel their sorrows by <lb/>
the mercies of a religious pity, and therefore <lb/>
as we leave their sorrows in many degrees unrelieved <lb/>
and uneased, so we contract by our <lb/>
<normalised orig="unmercifulnesse" auto="true">unmercifulness</normalised> a guilt by which our selves <lb/>
become liable to the same calamities. Those <lb/>
many that need pity, and those infinites of <lb/>
people that refuse to pity are miserable upon <lb/>
a several charge, but yet they almost make up <lb/>
all <normalised orig="mankinde" auto="true">mankind</normalised>. <lb/>
4. All wicked men are in love with that <lb/>
which <normalised orig="intangles" auto="true">entangles</normalised> them in huge variety of troubles, <lb/>
they are slaves to the worst of Masters, <lb/>
to sin and to the Devil, to a passion, and to an <lb/>
imperious woman. Good men are for ever <lb/>
persecuted, and God chastises every son whom <lb/>
he receives, and whatsoever is easy is trifling <lb/>
and worth nothing, and whatsoever is excellent <lb/>
is not to be obtained <lb/>
without labour and sorrow; <lb/>
and the conditions and <lb/>
states of men that are free <lb/>
from great cares, are such as <lb/>
have in them nothing rich <lb/>
and orderly, and those that <lb/>
have are stuck full of thorns <lb/>
and trouble. Kings are full <lb/>
of care; and learned men <lb/>
in all ages have been observed <lb/>
to be very poor, &amp; <lb/>
                  honestas miserias accusant; <lb/>
they complain of <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>the*r</sic>
                     <corr>their</corr>
                  </choice> honest <lb/>
miseries. <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
5. But these evils are notorious and confessed; <lb/>
even they also whose felicity men stare <lb/>
at and admire, besides their splendour and <lb/>
the <normalised orig="sharpnesse" auto="true">sharpness</normalised> of their light, will with their <lb/>
appendant sorrows wring a tear from the most <lb/>
resolved eye. For not only the winter quarter <lb/>
is full of storms and cold and <normalised orig="darknesse" auto="true">darkness</normalised>, but <lb/>
the beauteous spring <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> blasts and sharp <lb/>
frosts, the fruitful teeming summer is melted <lb/>
with heat, and burnt with the kisses of the <lb/>
sun her friend, and <normalised orig="choaked" auto="true">choked</normalised> with dust, <lb/>
and the rich Autumn is full of <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised>, and <lb/>
we are weary of that which we enjoy, because <lb/>
sorrow is its biggest portion: and when we <lb/>
remember that upon the fairest face is placed <lb/>
one of the worst sinks of the body, the nose, <lb/>
we may use it, not only as a mortification to <lb/>
the pride of beauty, but as an allay to the <lb/>
fairest outside of condition which any of the <lb/>
sons and daughters of Adam do <normalised orig="possesse" auto="true">possess</normalised>. For <lb/>
look upon Kings and <normalised orig="conquerours" auto="true">conquerors</normalised>: I will not <lb/>
tell that many of them fall into the condition <lb/>
of servants, and their subjects rule <lb/>
over them, and stand upon the <lb/>
<normalised orig="ruines" auto="true">ruins</normalised> of their families, and that <lb/>
to such persons, the sorrow is <lb/>
bigger then usually happens in <lb/>
smaller fortunes: but let us suppose <lb/>
them still <normalised orig="conquerers" auto="true">conquerors</normalised>, and see <lb/>
what a goodly purchase they get <lb/>
by all their pains and amazing <lb/>
fears, and continual dangers. They carry their <lb/>
arms beyond Ister, and <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> the Euphrates, <lb/>
and <normalised orig="binde" auto="true">bind</normalised> the Germans with the bounds of <lb/>
the river Rhyne: I speak in the stile of the <lb/>
Roman <normalised orig="greatnesse" auto="true">greatness</normalised>: for <join original="now adayes"><normalised orig="nowadayes" auto="false">nowadays</join></normalised>, the biggest <lb/>
fortune swells not beyond the limits of a petty <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="40">39</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
province or two, and a hill confines the <normalised orig="progresse" auto="true">progress</normalised> <lb/>
of their prosperity, or a river checks it: <lb/>
But whatsoever tempts the pride and vanity of <lb/>
ambitious persons is not so big as the smallest <lb/>
star which we see scattered in disorder, and <lb/>
unregarded upon the pavement and floor of <lb/>
Heaven. And if we would suppose the pismires <lb/>
had but our understandings, they also would <lb/>
have the method of a Mans <normalised orig="greatnesse" auto="true">greatness</normalised>, and <lb/>
divide their little <normalised orig="Mole-hils" auto="false">Molehills</normalised> into Provinces <lb/>
and Exarchats: and if they also grew as <normalised orig="vitious" auto="true">vicious</normalised> <lb/>
and as miserable, one of their princes <lb/>
would lead an army out, and kill his neighbour <lb/>
Ants that he might reign over the next <lb/>
<normalised orig="handfull" auto="true">handful</normalised> of a Turse. But then if we consider <lb/>
at what price, and with what felicity all this is <lb/>
purchased, the sting of the painted snake will <lb/>
quickly appear, and the fairest of their fortunes <lb/>
will properly enter into this account of <lb/>
humane infelicities. <lb/>
We may <normalised orig="guesse" auto="true">guess</normalised> at it by the constitution of <lb/>
Augustus fortune; who <normalised orig="strugled" auto="true">struggled</normalised> for his power, <lb/>
first with the Roman Citizens, then with <lb/>
Brutus and Cassius and all the fortune of the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Republike" auto="false">Republic</normalised>; then with his <normalised orig="Collegue" auto="true">Colleague</normalised> Marc. <lb/>
Anthony; then with his <normalised orig="kinred" auto="true">kindred</normalised> and <normalised orig="neerest" auto="true">nearest</normalised> <lb/>
Relatives; and after he was wearied with <lb/>
slaughter of the Romans, before he could sit <lb/>
down and rest in his imperial chair he was <lb/>
forced to carry armies into Macedonia, Galatia, <lb/>
beyond <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*uphrates</sic>
                     <corr>Euphrates</corr>
                  </choice>, Rhyne, and Danubius: <lb/>
And when he dwelt at home in <normalised orig="greatnesse" auto="true">greatness</normalised> and <lb/>
within the circles of a mighty power, he hardly <lb/>
escaped the sword of the Egnatii, of Lepidus, <lb/>
Caepio, and Muraena: and after he had entirely <lb/>
reduced the felicity and Grandeur into his own <lb/>
family, his Daughter, his <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> conspired <lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
with many of the young Nobility, and <lb/>
being <normalised orig="joyned" auto="true">joined</normalised> with adulterous complications <lb/>
as with an impious sacrament they affrighted <lb/>
and destroyed the fortune of the old man, <lb/>
and wrought him more sorrow then all the <lb/>
troubles that were hatched in the baths and <lb/>
beds of Egypt, between Anthony and Cleopatra. <lb/>
This was the greatest fortune that the world <lb/>
had then, or ever since, and therefore we cannot <lb/>
expect it to be better in a <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> prosperity. <lb/>
6. The prosperity of this world is so infinitely <lb/>
<normalised orig="sowred" auto="true">soured</normalised> with the overflowing of evils, <lb/>
that he is counted the most happy who <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
the fewest; all conditions being evil and <lb/>
miserable, they are <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> distinguished by the <lb/>
Number of calamities. The Collector of the <lb/>
Roman and <normalised orig="forreign" auto="true">foreign</normalised> examples, when he had <lb/>
reckoned two and twenty instances of great <lb/>
fortunes every one of which had been allayed <lb/>
with great variety of evils; in all his reading <lb/>
or experience he could tell but of two who <lb/>
had been famed for an <normalised orig="intire" auto="true">entire</normalised> prosperity; <lb/>
Quintus Metellus, and Gyges the King of Lydia; <lb/>
and yet concerning the one of them he tells <lb/>
that his felicity was so inconsiderable (and <lb/>
yet it was the bigger of the two) that the <lb/>
Oracle said that Aglaus the Sophidius the poor Arcadian <lb/>
Shepherd was more happy then he, <lb/>
that is, he had fewer troubles; for so indeed <lb/>
we are to reckon the pleasures of this life; the <lb/>
limit of our joy is the absence of some degrees of <lb/>
sorrow, and he that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> the least of this, is the <lb/>
most prosperous person. But then we must look <lb/>
for prosperity, not in Palaces or Courts of <lb/>
Princes, not in the tents of <normalised orig="Conquerers" auto="true">Conquerors</normalised>, or in <lb/>
the gaieties of fortunate and prevailing sinners; <lb/>
but something rather in the Cottages of <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="42">41</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
honest innocent and contented persons, whose <lb/>
<normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> is no bigger then their fortune, nor <lb/>
their <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> then their security. As for <lb/>
others whose fortune looks bigger, and allures <lb/>
fools to follow it like the <normalised orig="wandring" auto="true">wandering</normalised> fires of <lb/>
the night, till they run into rivers or are broken <lb/>
upon rocks with staring and running after <lb/>
them, they are all in the condition of <lb/>
Marius, then whose condition nothing was <lb/>
more constant, and nothing more mutable; if <lb/>
we reckon them amongst the happy, they are the <lb/>
most happy men, if we reckon them amongst the <lb/>
miserable, they are the most miserable. For just <lb/>
as is a mans condition, great or little, so is <lb/>
the state of his misery; All have their share; <lb/>
but Kings and Princes, great Generals and <lb/>
Consuls, Rich men and Mighty, as they have <lb/>
the biggest <normalised orig="businesse" auto="true">business</normalised> and the biggest charge, <lb/>
and are answerable to God for the greatest <lb/>
accounts, so they have the biggest trouble; <lb/>
that the <normalised orig="uneasinesse" auto="false">uneasiness</normalised> of their appendage may <lb/>
divide the good and evil of the world, <lb/>
making the poor mans fortune as eligible <lb/>
as the Greatest; and also restraining <lb/>
the vanity of mans spirit which a great <lb/>
Fortune is apt to swell from a vapour to a bubble; <lb/>
but God in mercy <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> mingled wormwood <lb/>
with their wine, and so restrained the <lb/>
<normalised orig="drunkennesse" auto="true">drunkenness</normalised> and follies of prosperity. <lb/>
7. Man never <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> one day to himself of entire <lb/>
peace from the things of this world, but either <lb/>
<normalised orig="somthing" auto="true">something</normalised> troubles him, or nothing satisfies <lb/>
him, or his very <normalised orig="fulnesse" auto="true">fullness</normalised> swells him and makes <lb/>
him breath short upon his bed. <normalised orig="Mens" auto="true">Men's</normalised> <normalised orig="joyes" auto="true">joys</normalised> <lb/>
are troublesome, and besides that the fear of <lb/>
losing them takes away the present pleasure <lb/>
(and a man had need of another felicity to <lb/>

1. THe effect of this consideration is this, <lb/>
That the sadnesses of this life help to <lb/>
sweeten the bitter cup of Death. For let our <lb/>
life be never so long, if our strength were <lb/>
great as that of oxen and camels; if our sinews <lb/>
were strong as the cordage at the foot of an <lb/>
<normalised orig="Oke" auto="true">Oak</normalised>, if we were as fighting and prosperous <lb/>
people as Siccius Dentatus, who was on the prevailing <lb/>
side in 120 <normalised orig="battels" auto="true">battles</normalised>, who had 312 <normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> <lb/>
rewards assigned him by his Generals and <lb/>
Princes for his valour, and conduct in sieges <lb/>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
and short encounters, and besides all this had <lb/>
his share in nine triumphs, yet still the period <lb/>
shall be, that all this shall end in death, <lb/>
and the people shall talk of us a while, <lb/>
good or <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised>, according as we deserve, or <lb/>
as they please; and once it shall come to <lb/>
<normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised>, that concerning every one of us it shall <lb/>
be told in the Neighbourhood that we are <lb/>
dead. This we are apt to think a sad story; <lb/>
but therefore let us help it with a sadder; <lb/>
For we therefore need not be much <lb/>
troubled that we shall die, because we are <lb/>
not here in ease, nor do we dwell in a fair <lb/>
condition. But our <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> are full of sorrow <lb/>
and anguish, dishonoured and made <lb/>
unhappy with many sins, with a frail and a <lb/>
foolish spirit, <normalised orig="intangled" auto="true">entangled</normalised> <choice ana="illegible">

delights, afflicted with want, with the evils <lb/>
of my self, and of all my family, and with <lb/>
the sadnesses of all my friends, and of all <lb/>
good men, even of the whole Church; and <lb/>
therefore me thinks we need not be troubled <lb/>
that God is pleased to put an end to <lb/>
all these troubles, and to let them sit down <lb/>
in a natural period, which if we please, may <lb/>
be to us the beginning of a better life. <lb/>
When the Prince of Persia wept because his <lb/>
army should all die in the revolution of an <lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
age, Artabanus told him, that they should <lb/>
all meet with evils so many and so great, <lb/>
that every man of them should wish himself <lb/>
dead long before that. Indeed it were <lb/>
a sad thing to be cut of the stone; and we <lb/>
that are in health tremble to think of it; <lb/>
but the man that is wearied with the disease, <lb/>
looks upon that <normalised orig="sharpnesse" auto="true">sharpness</normalised> as upon his <lb/>
cure and <normalised orig="remedie" auto="true">remedy</normalised>: and as none need to have <lb/>
a tooth drawn, so none could well endure <lb/>
it, but he that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> felt the pain of it in <lb/>
his head: so is our life so full of evils, that <lb/>
therefore death is no evil to them that have <lb/>
felt the smart of this, or hope for the <normalised orig="joyes" auto="true">joys</normalised> <lb/>
of a better. <lb/>
2. But as it helps to ease a certain sorrow, <lb/>
as a fire <normalised orig="drawes" auto="true">draws</normalised> out fire, and a nail <lb/>
drives forth a nail; so it instructs us in a <lb/>
present duty; that is; that we should not <lb/>
be so fond of a perpetual storm, nor <normalised orig="doat" auto="true">dote</normalised> <lb/>
upon the transient <normalised orig="gaudes" auto="true">gauds</normalised> and gilded <lb/>
thorns of this world. They are not worth <lb/>
a passion, nor worth a sigh or a groan, not <lb/>
of the price of one nights watching; and <lb/>
therefore they are mistaken and miserable <lb/>
persons who since Adam planted thorns round <lb/>
about Paradise, are more in love with that <lb/>
hedge, then with the fruits of the garden, <lb/>
sottish admirers of things that hurt them, of <lb/>
sweet poisons, gilded daggers and silken halters. <lb/>
Tell them they have lost a bounteous friend, <lb/>
a <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>r*ch</sic>
                     <corr>rich</corr>
                  </choice> purchase, a fair farm, a wealthy donative, <lb/>
and you dissolve their patience; It is an evil <lb/>
bigger then their spirit can bear, it brings <lb/>
<normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised> and death, they can neither <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> <lb/>
nor sleep with such a sorrow. But if you <lb/>
represent to them the evils of a <normalised orig="vitious" auto="true">vicious</normalised> habit, <lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
and the dangers of a state of sin; if <lb/>
you tell them they have displeased God, and <lb/>
interrupted their hopes of heaven, it may be <lb/>
they will be so civil as to hear it patiently, <lb/>
and to treat you kindly, and first to commend, and <lb/>
then to forget your story, because they prefer <lb/>
this world with all its <normalised orig="sorrowes" auto="true">sorrows</normalised>, before the <lb/>
pure unmingled felicities of heaven. But it is <lb/>
strange that any man should be so passionately <lb/>
in love with the thorns that grow on his own <lb/>
ground, that he should wear them for armelets, <lb/>
and knit them in his shirt, and prefer them <lb/>
before a kingdom and immortality. No man <lb/>
loves this world the better for his being poor; <lb/>
but men that love it, because they have great <lb/>
possessions, love it because it is troublesome <lb/>
and chargeable, full of noise and temptation; <lb/>
because it is unsafe and ungoverned, flattered <lb/>
and abused: and he that considers the troubles <lb/>
of an overlong garment, and of a crammed <lb/>
stomach, a trailing gown and a <normalised orig="loaden" auto="true">laden</normalised> <lb/>
Table, may justly understand that all that for <lb/>
which men are so passionate, is their hurt and <lb/>
their objection, that which a temperate man <lb/>
would avoid, and a wise man cannot love. <lb/>
He that is no fool, but can consider wisely; <lb/>
if he be in love with this world; we need not <lb/>
despair but that a witty man might reconcile <lb/>
him with tortures, and make him think charitably <lb/>
of the Rack, and be brought to dwell <lb/>
with Vipers and Dragons, and entertain his <lb/>
Guests with the shrikes of Mandrakes, Cats <lb/>
and Scrich Owls, with the filing of iron, and <lb/>
the <normalised orig="harshnesse" auto="true">harshness</normalised> of rending silk; or to admire <lb/>
the harmony that is made by a herd of Evening <lb/>
wolves when they <normalised orig="misse" auto="true">miss</normalised> their draught <lb/>
of blood in their midnight Revels. The groans <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="47">46</fw>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
of a man in a fit of the stone are worse then <lb/>
all these; and the distractions of a troubled <lb/>
conscience are worse then those groans; and yet <lb/>
a <normalised orig="carelesse" auto="true">careless</normalised> merry sinner is worse then all that. <lb/>
But if we could from one of the battlements <lb/>
of Heaven <normalised orig="espie" auto="true">espy</normalised> how many men and women <lb/>
at this time <normalised orig="lye" auto="true">lie</normalised> fainting and dying for want of <lb/>
bread, how many young men are <normalised orig="hewen" auto="true">hewn</normalised> down <lb/>
by the sword of war; how many poor Orphans <lb/>
are now weeping over the graves of their <lb/>
Father, by whose life they were enabled to eat. <lb/>
If we could but hear how many Mariners, <lb/>
and Passengers are at this present in a storm, <lb/>
and shrike out because their keel dashes against <lb/>
a Rock, or bulges under them; how <lb/>
many people there are that weep with want, <lb/>
and are mad with oppression, or are desperate <lb/>
by too quick a sense of a constant infelicity, <lb/>
in all reason we should be glad to be out of <lb/>
the noise and participation of so many evils. <lb/>
This is a place of sorrows and tears, of great <lb/>
evils and a constant calamity; let us remove <lb/>
from hence, at least in affections and preparation <lb/>
of <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>. <lb/>

that which indeed makes it so; and that is, <lb/>
that God <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> minister proper aids and supports <lb/>
to every of his servants whom he visits <lb/>
with his rod. He knows our needs, he pities our <lb/>
sorrows, he relieves our miseries, he supports <lb/>
our <normalised orig="weaknesse" auto="true">weakness</normalised>, he bids us ask for help, and he <lb/>
promises to give us all that, and he usually <lb/>
gives us more, and indeed it is observable, <lb/>
that no story tells of any godly man, who living <lb/>
in the fear of God fell into a violent and <lb/>
unpardoned impatience in his <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised> <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised>, <lb/>
if he used those means which God and <lb/>
his holy Church have appointed. We see almost <lb/>
all men bear their last <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised> with <normalised orig="sorrowes" auto="true">sorrows</normalised> <lb/>
indeed, but without violent passions; and <lb/>
<normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> they fear death violently, they suffer <lb/>
the <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised> with some <normalised orig="indifferency" auto="true">indifference</normalised>; and it is <lb/>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
a rare thing to see a man who <normalised orig="enjoyes" auto="true">enjoys</normalised> his reason <lb/>
in his <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised>, to <normalised orig="expresse" auto="true">express</normalised> the proper <lb/>
<normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> of a direct and <normalised orig="solemne" auto="true">solemn</normalised> impatience. For <lb/>
when God <normalised orig="layes" auto="true">lays</normalised> a <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised> upon us, he seizes <lb/>
commonly on a mans spirits, which are the <lb/>
instruments of action and <normalised orig="businesse" auto="true">business</normalised>; and when <lb/>
they are secured from being tumultuous, the <lb/>
sufferance is much the easier; and therefore <lb/>
<normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised> secures all that, which can do the <lb/>
man mischief. It makes him tame and passive, <lb/>
apt for suffering, and confines him to an unactive <lb/>
condition. To which if we <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised>, that <lb/>
God then commonly produces fear, and all <lb/>
those passions which naturally tend to humility <lb/>
and poverty of spirit, we shall soon perceive <lb/>
by what instruments God verifies his promise <lb/>
to us, (which is the great security for our patience, <lb/>
and the <normalised orig="easinesse" auto="true">easiness</normalised> of our condition) <lb/>
that God will lay no more upon us then he will <lb/>
make us able to bear, <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 10.13">but together with the affliction <lb/>
he will <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> a way to escape</quote>: Nay, if any <lb/>
thing can be more then this; we have two <lb/>

2. Prevent the violence and trouble of <lb/>
thy spirit by an act of thanksgiving; for which <lb/>
in the worst of sicknesses thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> not want <lb/>
cause, especially if thou <normalised orig="remembrest" auto="true">remember</normalised> that this <lb/>
pain is not an <normalised orig="eternall" auto="true">eternal</normalised> pain. <normalised orig="Blesse" auto="true">Bless</normalised> God for that; <lb/>
But take heed also lest you so order your affairs <lb/>
that you <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> from hence to an <normalised orig="eternall" auto="true">eternal</normalised> <lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">

                  </choice>. If that be hard, this will be intolerable, <lb/>
But as for the present evil, a few <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> will end <lb/>
it. <lb/>

                  <fw type="pageNum" n="100">F 2</fw>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
3. Remember that thou art a man and a <lb/>
Christian: as the Covenant of nature <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> made <lb/>
it necessary, so the covenant of grace <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> made it <lb/>
to be chosen by thee, to be a suffering person: <lb/>
either you must renounce your religion, or <lb/>
submit to the impositions of God, and thy <lb/>
portion of sufferings. So that here we see our <lb/>
advantages, and let us use them accordingly. <lb/>
The barbarous and warlike nations of old, <lb/>
could fight well and willingly, but could not <lb/>
bear <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised> manfully. The Greeks were <lb/>
cowardly in their fights, as most wise men are, <lb/>
but because they were learned and well <lb/>
taught, they bore their <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised> with patience <lb/>
and severity. The Cimbrians and Celtiberians <lb/>
<normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised> in <normalised orig="battail" auto="true">battle</normalised> like <normalised orig="Gyants" auto="true">Giants</normalised>, but in <lb/>
their diseases they weep like Women. These <lb/>
according to their institution and <normalised orig="designes" auto="true">designs</normalised> <lb/>
had unequal courages and accidental fortitude; <lb/>
but since our Religion <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> made a <lb/>
covenant of sufferings; and the great <normalised orig="businesse" auto="true">business</normalised> <lb/>
of our lives is sufferings; and most of the <normalised orig="vertues" auto="true">virtues</normalised> <lb/>
of a Christian are passive graces, and all <lb/>
the promises of the Gospel are passed upon us <lb/>
through Christs <normalised orig="crosse" auto="true">cross</normalised>, we have a necessity upon <lb/>
us to have an equal courage in all the variety <lb/>
of our sufferings: for without an universal <lb/>
fortitude we can do nothing of our <lb/>
<normalised orig="dutie" auto="true">duty</normalised>. <lb/>
4. Resolve to do as much as you can: for <lb/>
certain it is, we can suffer very much, if we <lb/>
list; and many men have afflicted themselves <lb/>
unreasonably by not being skilful to consider <lb/>
how much their strength and state could permit; <lb/>
and our flesh is nice and imperious, <lb/>
crafty to <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> reason that she <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> more <lb/>
necessities then indeed belong to her, and that <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="101">100</fw>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
she demands nothing superfluous: suffer as <lb/>
much in obedience to God as you can suffer <lb/>
for necessity, or passion, fear, or desire. And <lb/>
if you can for one thing, you can for another, <lb/>
and there is nothing wanting but the <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>. <lb/>
Never say; I can do no more, I cannot endure this. <lb/>
For God would not have sent it, if he had <lb/>
not known thee strong enough to abide it; <lb/>
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> he that knows thee well already, would <lb/>
also take this occasion to make thee know thy <lb/>
self. But it will be fit that you pray to God <lb/>
to give you a discerning spirit, that you may <lb/>
rightly distinguish just necessity from the flattery <lb/>
and fondnesses of flesh and blood. <lb/>
5. Propound to your eyes and heart the <lb/>
example of the holy Jesus upon the <normalised orig="crosse" auto="true">cross</normalised>; <lb/>
he endured more for thee then thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> <lb/>
either for thy self or him: and remember <lb/>
that if we be put to suffer, and do suffer in a <lb/>
good cause, or in a good manner, so that in any <lb/>
sense your sufferings be conformable to his <lb/>
sufferings, or can be capable of being united <lb/>
to his, we shall reign together with him. The <lb/>
high way of the <normalised orig="Crosse" auto="true">Cross</normalised> which the King of sufferings <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="troden" auto="true">trodden</normalised> before us, is the way to ease, <lb/>
to a kingdom, and to felicity. <lb/>
6. The very suffering is a title to an excellent <lb/>
inheritance: for, God chastens every son <lb/>
whom he receives, and if we be not chastised, <lb/>
we are bastards and not sons: and be confident, <lb/>
that although God often sends pardon without <lb/>
correction, yet he never sends correction without <lb/>
pardon, unless it be thy fault: and therefore <lb/>
take every or any affliction as an earnest <lb/>
<normalised orig="peny" auto="true">penny</normalised> of thy pardon; and upon condition there <lb/>
may be peace with God, let any thing be welcome <lb/>
that he can send as its instrument or <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="102">F 3</fw>
                  <pb n="16"/>
                  <lb/>
condition. Suffer therefore God to choose his <lb/>
own circumstances of <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>adopt*ng</sic>
                     <corr>adopting</corr>
                  </choice> thee, and be <lb/>
content to be under discipline when the reward <lb/>
of that is, to become the son of God: and <lb/>
by such inflictions he <normalised orig="hewes" auto="true">hues</normalised> and breaks thy <lb/>
body, first dressing it to funeral, and then preparing <lb/>
it for immortality: and if this be the <lb/>
effect of the <normalised orig="designe" auto="true">design</normalised> of Gods love to thee; let <lb/>
it be occasion of thy love to him: and remember <lb/>
that the truth of love is hardly known, <lb/>
but by somewhat that puts us to pain. <lb/>
7. Use this as a punishment for thy sins; <lb/>
and so God intends it most commonly; that <lb/>
is certain, if therefore thou <normalised orig="submittest" auto="false">submit</normalised> to it, <lb/>
thou <normalised orig="approvest" auto="false">approve</normalised> of the divine judgement: and <lb/>
no man can have cause to complain of any <lb/>
thing, but of himself; if either he believes <lb/>
God to be just, or himself to be a sinner: if <lb/>
he either thinks he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> deserved Hell, or <lb/>
that this little may be a means to prevent the <lb/>
greater, and bring him to Heaven. <lb/>
8. It may be that this may be the last instance, <lb/>
and the last opportunity that ever <lb/>
God will give thee to exercise any <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised>, to <lb/>
do him any service, or thy self any advantage; <lb/>
be careful that thou <normalised orig="losest" auto="true">lose</normalised> not this; for to <lb/>
eternal ages, this never shall return again. <lb/>
9. Or if thou peradventure shalt be restored <lb/>
to health, be <normalised orig="carefull" auto="true">careful</normalised> that in the day of <lb/>
thy thanksgiving, thou <normalised orig="mayest" auto="true">may</normalised> not be ashamed <lb/>
of thy self, for having behaved thy self poorly <lb/>
and weakly upon thy bed: it will be a sensible <lb/>
and excellent comfort to thee, and double <lb/>
upon thy spirit, if when thou shalt worship <lb/>
God for restoring thee, thou shalt also remember <lb/>
that thou <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> do him service in thy suffering, <lb/>
and tell that God was hugely gracious <lb/>
                  <pb n="17"/>
                  <lb/>
to thee in giving thee the opportunity of a <lb/>
<normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised>, at so <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> a rate as a <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised>, from <lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>wh*ch</sic>
                     <corr>which</corr>
                  </choice> thou <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> recover. <lb/>
10. Few men are so sick, but they believe <lb/>
that they may recover; and we <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> seldom see <lb/>
a man lie down with a perfect persuasion that <lb/>
it is his last hour; for many men have been <lb/>
sicker, and yet have recovered; but whether <lb/>
thou doest or no, thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> a <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> to exercise, <lb/>
which may be a handmaid to thy patience. <lb/>
Epaphroditus was sick, sick unto death, <lb/>
and yet God had mercy upon him; and he <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> done so to thousands, to whom he found <lb/>
it useful in the great order of things, and the <lb/>
events of universal providence. If therefore <lb/>
thou <normalised orig="desirest" auto="true">desire</normalised> to recover, here is cause enough <lb/>
of hope; and hope is designed in the arts of <lb/>
God and of the Spirit, to support patience. <lb/>
But if thou <normalised orig="recoverest" auto="true">recover</normalised> not, yet there is something <lb/>
that is matter of joy naturally, and very <lb/>
much Spiritually if thou <normalised orig="belongest" auto="false">belong</normalised> to God, <lb/>
and joy is as certain a support to patience, as <lb/>
hope; and it is no small cause of being pleased, <lb/>
when we remember that if we recover not, <lb/>
our <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised> shall the sooner sit down in rest <lb/>
and joy. For recovery by death, as it is easier <lb/>
and better then the recovery by a sickly <lb/>
health, so it is not so long in doing: it suffers <lb/>
not the <normalised orig="tediousnesse" auto="true">tediousness</normalised> of a creeping restitution, <lb/>
nor the inconvenience of Surgeons and <normalised orig="Physitians" auto="true">Physicians</normalised>, <lb/>
<normalised orig="watchfulnesse" auto="true">watchfulness</normalised> and care, keepings in, <lb/>
and suffering trouble, fears of relapse and the <lb/>
little <normalised orig="reliques" auto="true">relics</normalised> of a storm. <lb/>
11. While we hear, or use, or think of these <lb/>
remedies, part of the <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised> is gone away, <lb/>
and all of it is passing. And if by such instruments <lb/>
we stand armed and ready dressed before <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="104">F 4</fw>
                  <pb n="18"/>
                  <lb/>
hand, we shall avoid <lb/>
the mischiefs of amazements <lb/>
and <normalised orig="surprize" auto="true">surprise</normalised>; while <lb/>
the accidents of <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised> <lb/>
are such as were expected, <lb/>
and against which we stood <lb/>
in <normalised orig="readinesse" auto="true">readiness</normalised> with our spirits, contracted, instructed, <lb/>
and put upon the defensive. <lb/>
12. But our patience will be the better secured, <lb/>
if we consider that it is not violently <lb/>
tempted by the usual arrests of <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised>; for <lb/>
patience is with reason demanded while the <lb/>
<normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised> is tolerable; that is, so long as the <lb/>
evil is not too great; but if it be also eligible, <lb/>
and have in it some degrees of good, our patience <lb/>
will have in it the <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> difficulty, and <lb/>
the greater necessity. This therefore will be a <lb/>
new stock of consideration. <normalised orig="Sicknesse" auto="true">Sickness</normalised> is in many <lb/>
degrees eligible to many men, and to many purposes. <lb/>
