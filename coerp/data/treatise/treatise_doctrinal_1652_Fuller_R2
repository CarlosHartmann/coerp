                  <lb/>
The good Bishop,</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
HE is an Overseer of a Flock of Shepherds, as a Minister <lb/>
            is of a Flock of Gods sheep. Divine providence and <lb/>
            his Princes bounty advanced him to the Place, whereof he <lb/>
            was no whit ambitious: <normalised orig="Onely" auto="true">Only</normalised> he counts it good manners <lb/>
            to sit there where God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> placed him, though it be higher <lb/>
            then he conceives himself to deserve, and hopes that he who <lb/>
            <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> him to the Office <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> or will in some measure fit him <lb/>
            for it. <lb/>
            His life is so <normalised orig="spotlesse" auto="true">spotless</normalised>, that Malice is angry with him, because <lb/>
            she cannot be angry with him: because she can find no just cause <lb/>
            to accuse him. And as Diogenes confuted him who <normalised orig="denyed" auto="true">denied</normalised> <lb/>
            there was any motion, by saying nothing but walking <lb/>
            before his eyes; so our Bishop takes no notice of the false <lb/>
            accusations of people disaffected against his order, but walks <lb/>
            on circumspectly in his calling, really <normalised orig="refelling" auto="false">refilling</normalised> their cavils in <lb/>
            his conversation. A Bishops bare presence at a marriage in <lb/>
            his own <normalised orig="diocesse" auto="true">diocese</normalised>, is by the Law interpreted for a licence; and <lb/>
            what actions <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised> he <normalised orig="graceth" auto="true">graces</normalised> with his company, he is conceived <lb/>
            to <normalised orig="priviledge" auto="true">privilege</normalised> them to be <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised>, which makes him <lb/>
            to be more wary in his behaviour. <lb/>
            With his honour, his <normalised orig="holinesse" auto="true">holiness</normalised> and humility <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> increase. His <lb/>
            great Place makes not his piety the <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised>: <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> be it from <lb/>
            him that the glittering of the candlestick should <normalised orig="dimme" auto="true">dim</normalised> the <lb/>
            shining of his candle. The meanest Minister of Gods word <lb/>
            may have free <normalised orig="accesse" auto="true">access</normalised> unto him: whosoever brings a good <lb/>
            cause brings his own welcome with him. The pious <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> <lb/>
            may enter in at his wide gates, When not so much as his <lb/>
            wicket shall be open to wealthy <normalised orig="unworthinesse" auto="true">unworthiness</normalised>. <lb/>
            He is diligent and <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> in preaching the Gospel: either by <lb/>
            his pen, Evangelizo manu &amp;scriptione, saith a strict Divine; <lb/>
            or by his <normalised orig="vocall" auto="true">vocal</normalised> Sermons (if age and other indispensable occasions <lb/>
            hinder him not) teaching the Clergy to preach, and <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="266">Z 2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
            the Laity to live, according to the ancient Canons. Object <lb/>
            not that it is unfitting he should lie Perdue, who is to walk <lb/>
            the round, and that Governing as an higher employment is <lb/>
            to silence his preaching: For preaching is a <normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised> part <lb/>
            of Governing, and Christ himself <normalised orig="ruleth" auto="true">rules</normalised> his Church by his <lb/>
            Word. Hereby Bishops shall govern hearts, and make men <lb/>
            yield unto them a true and willing obedience, reverencing <lb/>
            God in them. Many in consumptions have <normalised orig="recover'd" auto="true">recovered</normalised> their <lb/>
            healths by returning to their native <normalised orig="aire" auto="true">air</normalised> wherein they were <lb/>
            born: If Episcopacy be in any declination or diminution of <lb/>
            honour, the going back to the <normalised orig="painfulnesse" auto="false">painfulness</normalised> of the primitive <lb/>
            Fathers in preaching, is the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> way to repair it. <lb/>
            <normalised orig="Painfull" auto="true">Painful</normalised>, pious, and peaceable Ministers are his <normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised> Favourites. <lb/>
            If he meets them in his way (yea he will make it his <lb/>
            way to meet them) he <normalised orig="bestoweth" auto="true">bestows</normalised> all grace and lustre upon <lb/>
            them. <lb/>
            He is <normalised orig="carefull" auto="true">careful</normalised> that Church-censures be justly and solemnly inflicted: <lb/>
            namely, <lb/>
            1. Admonition, when the Church <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <normalised orig="chideth" auto="true">chides</normalised>, but with <lb/>
            the rod in her hand. <lb/>
            2. Excommunication, the Mittimus whereby the <normalised orig="Malefactour" auto="true">Malefactor</normalised> <lb/>
            is sent to the <normalised orig="gaolour" auto="false">gaoler</normalised> of hell, and delivered to <lb/>
            Satan. <lb/>
            3. Aggravation, whereby for his greater contempt, he is <lb/>
            removed out of the gaole into the dungeon. <lb/>
            4. Penance, which is or should be inward repentance, <lb/>
            made visible by open confession, whereby the Congregation <lb/>
            is satisfied for the <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> offence given her. <lb/>
            5. Absolution, which <normalised orig="fetcheth" auto="true">fetches</normalised> the penitent out of hell, and <lb/>
            opens the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised> of heaven for him, which Excommunication <lb/>
            had formerly <normalised orig="lock'd" auto="true">locked</normalised>, and Aggravation bolted <lb/>
            against him. <lb/>
            As much as lies in his power, he either prevents or corrects <lb/>
            those too frequent abuses, whereby offenders are not <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Acts 2.37"><normalised orig="prick'd" auto="true">pricked</normalised> to the heart</quote>, but let <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> in the purse; and when the <lb/>
            Court <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> her costs, the Church <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> no damage given her, <lb/>
            nor any reparation for the open <normalised orig="scandall" auto="true">scandal</normalised> she received by the <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
            parties offence. Let the memory of Worthy Bishop Lake <lb/>
            ever survive, whose hand had the true seasoning of a Sermon <lb/>
            with Law and Gospel, and who was most fatherly grave in <lb/>
            inflicting Church-censures: Such offenders as were unhappy <lb/>
            in deserving, were happy in doing penance in his presence. <lb/>
            He is <normalised orig="carefull" auto="true">careful</normalised> and happy in suppressing of Heresies and <normalised orig="Schismes" auto="true">Schisms</normalised>. <lb/>
            He <normalised orig="distinguisheth" auto="true">distinguishes</normalised> of <normalised orig="Schismaticks" auto="true">Schismatics</normalised>, as Physicians do of Leprous <lb/>
            people: Some are infectious, others not; Some are <lb/>
            active to seduce others, others quietly enjoy their opinions <lb/>
            in their own consciences. The latter by his <normalised orig="mildnesse" auto="true">mildness</normalised> he <lb/>
            easily <normalised orig="reduceth" auto="true">reduces</normalised> to the truth; whereas the <normalised orig="Chirurgions" auto="false">Surgeons</normalised> rigorously <lb/>
            handling it, often breaks that bone quite off, <lb/>
            which formerly was but out of <normalised orig="joynt" auto="true">joint</normalised>: Towards the former <lb/>
            he <normalised orig="useth" auto="true">uses</normalised> more severity, yet endeavouring first to inform him <lb/>
            aright, before he <normalised orig="punisheth" auto="true">punishes</normalised> him. To use force first before <lb/>
            people are fairly taught the truth, is to knock a nail into <lb/>
            a board, without wimbling a hole for it, which then <lb/>
            either not enters, or turns crooked, or splits the wood it <lb/>
            <normalised orig="pierceth" auto="true">pierces</normalised>. <lb/>
            He is very <normalised orig="mercifull" auto="true">merciful</normalised> in punishing offenders: both in matter of <lb/>
            life and <normalised orig="livelyhood" auto="true">livelihood</normalised>, seeing in S. Johns Language the same <lb/>
            word <choice ana="illegible">

            <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>. It was the honour of the Roman State, as yet being <lb/>
            pagan, In hoc gloriari licet, nulli gentium mitiores placuisse poenas: <lb/>
            Yea, for the first seventy years (till the reign of Ancus Martius) <lb/>
            they were without a prison. Clemency therefore in a <lb/>
            Christian Bishop is more proper. O let not the <normalised orig="Starrs" auto="true">Stars</normalised> of our <lb/>
            Church be herein <normalised orig="turn'd" auto="true">turned</normalised> to Comets, whose appearing in place <lb/>
            of judicature, <normalised orig="presageth" auto="true">presages</normalised> to some death or destruction. I <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> <lb/>
            that even Justice it self is a kind of mercy: But God <lb/>
            grant that my portion of mercy be not paid me in that <lb/>
            coin. And though the highest detestation of <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>, best <lb/>
            <normalised orig="agreeth" auto="true">agrees</normalised> with Clergy-men; yet ought they to cast a severe <lb/>
            eye on the vice and example, and a <normalised orig="mercifull" auto="true">merciful</normalised> eye on the <lb/>
            person. <lb/>
            None more forward to forgive a wrong done to himself. Worthy <lb/>

                and without mans envy. <lb/>
                His mortified mind is no whit moved with the magnificent <lb/>
                vanities of the Court: no more then a dead corps is affected <lb/>
                with a velvet <normalised orig="herse-cloth" auto="false">horse-cloth</normalised> over it. He is so <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> from <normalised orig="wondring" auto="true">wondering</normalised> <lb/>
                at their <normalised orig="pomps" auto="true">pumps</normalised>, that though he looks daily on them, <lb/>
                he scarce sees them, having his eyes taken up with higher <lb/>

                Yet he daily <normalised orig="prayeth" auto="true">prays</normalised> God to keep him in so slippery a place. Elisha <lb/>
                prayed that a double portion of Eliahs Spirit might rest <lb/>

                at Court, lived in a <normalised orig="plentifull" auto="true">plentiful</normalised> way, and favoured of the <lb/>
                Kings of Israel; whereas Eliah lived poorly, and privately: <lb/>

                And more <normalised orig="wisdome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised> is requisite to manage prosperity then <lb/>
                affliction. <lb/>
                In his grave writings, he aims at Gods glory, and the Churches <lb/>
                peace, with that worthy Prelate, the second Jewel of Salisbury, <lb/>
                whose comments and controversies will transmit his <lb/>
                memory to all Posterity: <lb/>
                Whose dying pen did write of Christian Union. <lb/>
                How Church with Church might safely keep Communion. <lb/>
                Commend his care, although the cure do <normalised orig="misse" auto="true">miss</normalised>; <lb/>
                The woe is ours, the <normalised orig="happinesse" auto="true">happiness</normalised> is his: <lb/>
                Who finding discords daily to <normalised orig="encrease" auto="true">increase</normalised>, <lb/>
                Because he could not live, would <normalised orig="dy" auto="true">die</normalised>, in peace. <lb/>
                He ever makes honourable mention of <normalised orig="forein" auto="true">foreign</normalised> Protestant Churches; <lb/>
                even when he differs and dissents from them. The worst he <lb/>
                <normalised orig="wisheth" auto="true">wishes</normalised> the French Church, is a Protestant King: not giving <lb/>
                the left hand of fellowship to them, and reserving his right <lb/>
                for some other. Can not Christs coat be of different colours, <lb/>
                but also it must be of <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> seams? railing one on another, <lb/>
                till these Sisters, by bastardizing one another, make the Popish <lb/>
                Church the sole heir to all truth. How often did reverend <lb/>
                Whitgift (knowing he had the <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> better <normalised orig="cheere" auto="true">cheer</normalised>) <lb/>

                of Geneva? relieving many of them by <normalised orig="bountifull" auto="true">bountiful</normalised> contributions. <lb/>
                Indeed English charity to <normalised orig="forein" auto="true">foreign</normalised> protestant Churches, <lb/>
                in some respect is payment of a debt: their children deserve <lb/>
                to be our welcome guests, whose Grandfathers were our loving <lb/>
                hosts in the days of Queen Mary. <lb/>
                He is <normalised orig="thankfull" auto="true">thankful</normalised> to that <normalised orig="Colledge" auto="true">College</normalised> whence he had his education. He <lb/>

            He is hospitable in his housekeeping according to his estate. His <lb/>
            bounty is with discretion to those that deserve it: Charity <lb/>
            mistaken, which relieves idle people, like a dead corps, <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <lb/>
