HE cannot not so much as to this<lb/>
Discourse of the Altar, without Bowing;<lb/>
which makes him fall upon this Preamble<lb/>
so impertinently. But let him bow as often<lb/>

or to honour him (and him <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>) in his holy Sacrament.<lb/>

the Greek Liturgies, NoValue a modest and humble<lb/>

their <normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised> penance. And if we may believe<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
their modern Divines, it was two-fold, a greater,<lb/>

bowed all their Body, yet without bending of<lb/>
the knee, very lowly and almost to the earth.<lb/>
The lesser, with the inclination and bending of<lb/>
the Head and shoulders <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>. Which or whether<lb/>
any of these were used in the Western Churches,<lb/>

S. <normalised orig="Hierome" auto="true">Jerome</normalised> seems to imply, that it was done with<lb/>

                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
the Vicar should erect any such Altar, that is, a<lb/>
close Altar at the upper end of the Quire, where<lb/>
the old Altar in Q. <normalised orig="Maries" auto="true">Mary's</normalised> time stood, that then,<lb/>
his discretion would prove the sole Holocaust should<lb/>
be sacrificed thereupon. Not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> because his discretion,<lb/>
being of a very airy and thin substance,<lb/>
would quickly (as a Holocaust should do) vanish<lb/>
into nothing; but by reason that <normalised orig="therby" auto="true">thereby</normalised> he should<lb/>
put himself into the very Case, that Isaac <normalised orig="conceiv'd" auto="true">conceived</normalised><lb/>
his father to be in: <quote type="biblical" ana="Gen 22.7">Behold the Fire and<lb/>
wood, but where is the Lamb for the burnt-offering?</quote>
                  <lb/>
Because the 31 Article having taken away the Popish<lb/>
Lamb (for the which that old Altar had been<lb/>
erected) as a Blasphemous figment and pernicious<lb/>
imposture; the Homily had commanded us to<lb/>
take heed, we should look to <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> it in the<lb/>
blessed Sacrament of the Lords Supper: For there<lb/>
it was not: There was indeed in the Sacrament<lb/>
a Memory of a Sacrifice, but Sacrifice there was<lb/>
none. And we must take heed of quillets and<lb/>
distinctions, that may bring us back <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to<lb/>
the old <normalised orig="Errour" auto="true">Error</normalised> reformed in the Church. Whereof<lb/>
this was a <normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised> part: That we should<lb/>
not consecrate upon profane Tables (as the Rhemists<lb/>
most profanely <normalised orig="term'd" auto="true">termed</normalised> them) which relate<lb/>
to a Supper, but upon sacred Altars <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, which<lb/>
<normalised orig="referre" auto="true">refer</normalised> to a Sacrifice. For so <normalised orig="Cardinall" auto="true">Cardinal</normalised> Peron<lb/>
<normalised orig="observeth" auto="true">observes</normalised>, that it is ever <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> a Table, when it<lb/>
points to the Communion or Supper; and an Altar,<lb/>
when it points to the Sacrifice. Now the Homily<lb/>
stating in one sentence most of the Controversies<lb/>
in this matter between us and the Church of<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
Rome, by an enumeration of <normalised orig="opposit" auto="true">opposite</normalised> and distinct<lb/>
species, (the one whereof, as in <normalised orig="Logick" auto="true">Logic</normalised> the nature<lb/>
of such is <normalised orig="describ'd" auto="true">described</normalised> to be, if we make the Doctrine<lb/>
of our Church, we cannot without implication<lb/>
make the other) observes these <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> contradistinguished<lb/>
Tenets or Positions:  We must make<lb/>
the Lords Supper <normalised orig="fruitfull" auto="true">fruitful</normalised> to us that be alive, not<lb/>
to the dead: both we of this Church cannot do.<lb/>
 We must receive it in two parts, not in one only:<lb/>
both we of this Church cannot do.  We must<lb/>
make it a Communion, or <normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised>, not a private<lb/>
eating: both we of this Church cannot do.<lb/>
 Lastly, we must make it a Memory, and not a<lb/>
Sacrifice: both we of this Church cannot do.<lb/>
And this is the passage cited by the Writer. We<lb/>
must take heed, lest of a Memory it be made a<lb/>
Sacrifice. What saith the <normalised orig="Doctour" auto="true">Doctor</normalised> to this? He<lb/>
saith, that by these words the Church admits of<lb/>
a Commemorative Sacrifice. Which is as much<lb/>
as Peter Lombard and all his ragged regiment<lb/>
admit of. I am (as K. James of famous memory<lb/>
was wont to say) a Slave to reason, and must<lb/>
<normalised orig="yeeld" auto="true">yield</normalised> when ever I am thus summoned by it. I<lb/>
<normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> the man <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> found a true and <normalised orig="reall" auto="true">real</normalised><lb/>
Sacrifice; but it is a Bull:<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  Taurum Neptuno, Taurum tibi pulcher Apollo.
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
A very strange and hideous Bull, which this Calf<lb/>
makes the Church to speak unto her people in<lb/>
her <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Homilies. As we must take heed,<lb/>
good People, we apply not the Sacrament of the<lb/>
Supper to the dead, but to the living; receive it<lb/>
not under one, but under both <normalised orig="kindes" auto="true">kinds</normalised>; Let not the<lb/>

                  <lb/>
Priest swallow up <choice ana="illegible">

                  </choice>, but take our part with him:<lb/>
So must we take <normalised orig="especiall" auto="true">especial</normalised> heed, lest of a Commemorative<lb/>
Sacrifice, it be made a Sacrifice. Which<lb/>
though it be not so fierce as Pius Quintus his, yet<lb/>
is a <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> of Pious Bull. But the Church in her<lb/>
Homily, or any other <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> writing, never<lb/>
speaks a word of any Commemorative Sacrifice, but<lb/>
of the Memory <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> of a Sacrifice, that is (as she<lb/>
clearly interprets her self in the page before) of<lb/>
the Memory of Christs death, which she there affirms<lb/>
to be sufficiently celebrated upon a Table.<lb/>
And I shall be able to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> unto you, that it is<lb/>
<normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> by S. Austin, a Sacrament of Memory; by<lb/>
Eusebius, a Sacrifice of Memory: which is the<lb/>
word in the Homily. You will not be able to<lb/>
<normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> unto me out of S. Austin, or any of the<lb/>
Fathers (although <normalised orig="Cardinall" auto="true">Cardinal</normalised> Peron affirms it<lb/>
to be sometimes used by them; which Bellarmine<lb/>
utterly denies) no nor out of Peter Lombard<lb/>
himself (upon whose old rubbish they<lb/>
have built the distinction) and least of all (saith<lb/>
Chemnitius, which Bellarmine also approves)<lb/>
out of Scripture; that it is <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> punctually a<lb/>
Commemorative Sacrifice. All that Peter Lombard<lb/>
saith in a manner is <choice ana="illegible">

it is a true Sacrifice (for you see those two<lb/>
terms are <normalised orig="contradistinguish'd" auto="false">contradistinguished</normalised>) but because it is<lb/>
a Memory and representation of a true <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>S*crifice</sic>
                     <corr>Sacrifice</corr>
                  </choice>.<lb/>
A true Sacrifice it is not (The Christian Church<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> but one in that <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised>:) but a Memory <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised><lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
of a true Sacrifice. So likewise S. Chrysostom, when<lb/>
he had <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> it NoValue, a Sacrifice, eats up his<lb/>
word by and by, and <normalised orig="addes" auto="true">adds</normalised> (by way of explication,<lb/>
yea, and correction too, as one observes;<lb/>
correction of that <normalised orig="excesse" auto="true">excess</normalised> of speech, saith a Reverend<lb/>
Prelate of this Church; That no man<lb/>
might take offence at the speech, saith Archbishop<lb/>
Cranmer) NoValue I should rather<lb/>
have said, a Memory of a Sacrifice. You know<lb/>
best, saith Casaubon to <normalised orig="Cardinall" auto="true">Cardinal</normalised> Peron, what<lb/>
weight and <normalised orig="efficacie" auto="true">efficacy</normalised> those little particles, NoValue
                  <lb/>
do carry with them I am sure, saith Mounsieur<lb/>

Surely, if you put them in an even and <normalised orig="unpartiall" auto="false">unpartial</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="ballance" auto="true">balance</normalised>, the name of Sacrifice will prove<lb/>
too light, and the Memory of a Sacrifice <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised><lb/>
will <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> for the currant and <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised> money.<lb/>
I know some few learned men of the reformed<lb/>
Church do use the name of Commemorative Sacrifices:<lb/>
but it is not with an intent to disturb<lb/>
the Doctrine of Gods Church, as it is taught<lb/>
now; but to give a candid and <normalised orig="faire" auto="true">fair</normalised> interpretation<lb/>
to those words of Art, by which this self-same<lb/>
Doctrine <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> heretofore illustrated<lb/>
by the ancient Fathers. Besides that, our truly<lb/>
learned men do set down precisely, that a<lb/>
Commemorative Sacrifice, is not properly a Sacrifice,<lb/>
but as (K. <normalised orig="Iames" auto="true">James</normalised> took it rightly) Commemoratio<lb/>
Sacrificii, a Commemoration <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> of a Sacrifice,<lb/>
which differs in predicament (then the<lb/>
which nothing can be more) from a true Sacrifice.<lb/>
And yet the most learned in this Theme<lb/>

                  <lb/>
the Homily, to it you shall go; little to your<lb/>
comfort, I hope. The immediate words before<lb/>
these we <normalised orig="spake" auto="true">spoke</normalised> of, are those of S.Ambrose. That<lb/>
he is unworthy of the Lord, that otherwise <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> celebrate<lb/>
that Mystery, then it was delivered by him.<lb/>
Neither can he be devout, that <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> otherwise presume<lb/>
then it was given by the Author. We must <normalised orig="therfore" auto="true">therefore</normalised><lb/>
take heed, lest of a memory, &amp;c. Now there is<lb/>
no one word in Christs Institution, that can probably<lb/>
<normalised orig="inferre" auto="true">infer</normalised> a proper Sacrifice: As our reverend<lb/>
Bishop proves at large. Nor was there extant<lb/>
any one word of all these Collects of our own (or<lb/>
of any other <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> whatsoever) from whence<lb/>
you muster up your unproper Sacrifices, in the Apostles<lb/>
times. In which Age, they consecrated the<lb/>
Sacrament of the Supper with the short Canon of<lb/>
the Lords Prayer <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>; out of the which, you<lb/>
must <normalised orig="bestirre" auto="true">bestir</normalised> you well with your <normalised orig="Logick" auto="true">Logic</normalised>, before<lb/>
you can <normalised orig="inferre" auto="true">infer</normalised> all your unproper and <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> Sacrifices.<lb/>
And if you should wring them all out<lb/>
of these six Petitions, yet will it not serve your<lb/>
turn, <normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> you prove that the Lords Prayer cannot<lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
be said in Pew or Pulpit, but at an Altar <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>,<lb/>
But to deal clearly with you, and to come to the<lb/>
point. I do grant freely, that in the Scripture and<lb/>
the ancient Fathers, we do meet with, not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised><lb/>
those few which you reckon up, but a great many<lb/>
more duties and <normalised orig="vertues" auto="true">virtues</normalised> of Christian men, that<lb/>
are usually <normalised orig="term'd" auto="true">termed</normalised> by the Names of Sacrifices;<lb/>
howbeit (for the most part) they have (as<lb/>
Bellarmine observes) their <normalised orig="Sirnames" auto="true">Surnames</normalised> also and<lb/>
Additions put unto them. The learned Prelate<lb/>
of our own Nation reckons up some six out of<lb/>
Scripture, and a great many more out of the ancient<lb/>
Fathers. And it is no <normalised orig="marvell" auto="true">marvel</normalised>; For I could<lb/>
fill a page or two, if I list, with the like Sacrifices,<lb/>
out of the very heathen Writers. Hold this the<lb/>
most glorious of all thy Oblations, if thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> exhibit<lb/>
thy self unto the Gods a most just and excellent<lb/>
man, saith Isocrates. It were a <normalised orig="pitifull" auto="true">pitiful</normalised> case indeed<lb/>
(saith Socrates in Plato) if the Gods should regard<lb/>
the Perfumes <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, and not the Souls and <normalised orig="Vertues" auto="true">Virtues</normalised> of<lb/>
<normalised orig="mortall" auto="true">mortal</normalised> men. Lastly, I will <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised> that most admirable<lb/>
passage of the Poet, applauded and commented<lb/>
upon by Lactantius himself. Let us sacrifice<lb/>
unto the gods<lb/>
                  Compositum jus, fásq; animi, sanctóq; recessus<lb/>

I will likewise allow you, (which your indigested<lb/>
Meditations forgot to call for) that all these<lb/>
<normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> Odours, improperly called Sacrifices, are<lb/>
not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> stirred up and made more fragrant with<lb/>
the Meditation, but many times sown of seeds,<lb/>
and <normalised orig="engendred" auto="true">engendered</normalised> at first by the secret operation of<lb/>

this blessed Sacrament. Nay yet further; In contemplation<lb/>
of all these rare and <normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised> Graces<lb/>
of the Spirit, wrought in our <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised> by means of<lb/>
the Eucharist, you shall not reasonably expect<lb/>
any outward expression of reverence and submission<lb/>
to the Founder of the <choice ana="illegible">

that blessed Sanctuary. I will encourage Melania<lb/>
to <normalised orig="beautifie" auto="true">beautify</normalised> that place, with the forbearance<lb/>
(if need be) of her chiefest Ornaments. I could<lb/>
say in a manner with that Italian Prelate, that<lb/>
God in that holy Table, which he finds <normalised orig="ful" auto="true">full</normalised> of dust, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised><lb/>
write down the sins of the <normalised orig="carelesse" auto="true">careless</normalised> Church-man. But<lb/>
this I can by no means approve, which Protestants<lb/>
and Papists do <normalised orig="joyntly" auto="true">jointly</normalised> deny, that ever <normalised orig="materiall" auto="true">material</normalised><lb/>
Altar was erected in the Church for the<lb/>
use of <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> and improper Sacrifices. The Sacrifice<lb/>
which Malachy speaks of, being the Sacrifice of<lb/>
praise and thanksgiving, all people offer unto God, as<lb/>
well as the Priest; be they at the blessed Sacrament,<lb/>
at Prayers, or at some charitable work, at any time,<lb/>
&amp; in any place whatsoever; saith Archbishop Cranmer.<lb/>
If question be asked, Is there then no Sacrifices<lb/>
now left to be done of Christian people? yea truly,<lb/>
but none other then such as ought to be done without<lb/>
Altars. And these be of three sorts, &amp;c.<lb/>
For <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> instanceth in three of those which<lb/>
the <normalised orig="Doctour" auto="true">Doctor</normalised> <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> instance upon in this Book;<lb/>

Praise and Thanksgiving, our <normalised orig="Soules" auto="true">Souls</normalised> and Bodies,<lb/>
and Oblations for the <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised>: And then concludes;<lb/>
Seeing Christian men have no other Sacrifices then<lb/>
these, which may and ought to be done without Altars,<lb/>
there should amongst Christians be no Altars;<lb/>
saith Bishop Hooper. Priest, Altar, and Sacrifice<lb/>
are Relatives, and have <normalised orig="mutuall" auto="true">mutual</normalised> and unseparable <normalised orig="dependance" auto="true">dependence</normalised><lb/>
one of each other. So he, and truly. But<lb/>
you ought <choice ana="illegible">

                     <corr>to</corr>
                  </choice> take with you a necessary Caution, observed<lb/>
by the same <normalised orig="Cardinall" auto="true">Cardinal</normalised>, That an unproper Sacrifice<lb/>
cannot <normalised orig="inferre" auto="true">infer</normalised> a proper Altar, saith the Lo. Bishop<lb/>
of Duresme; when he had said a little before<lb/>
(most truly and learnedly) that a Commemorative<lb/>
Sacrifice cannot be a proper Sacrifice: and therefore<lb/>
cannot <normalised orig="inferre" auto="true">infer</normalised> a proper Altar. Then for the<lb/>
Pontificians, they are all of this opinion; I will<lb/>
single out a few of the Prime. An Altar of Stone is<lb/>
never erected to praise God or say our prayers at, saith<lb/>
Salmeron. If not of Stone, neither of Timber; for<lb/>
that makes not the difference. There is none so<lb/>
<normalised orig="blinde" auto="true">blind</normalised>, but he may see that these Christian duties and<lb/>
Ceremonies may be performed to God without an Altar,<lb/>
saith Bellarm. And he quotes to confirm this<lb/>
point, the <normalised orig="testimonie" auto="true">testimony</normalised> of Calvin; They that extend<lb/>
the name of Sacrifice to all Ceremonies and religious<lb/>
<normalised orig="Actio~s" auto="false">Actions</normalised>, I do not see what <normalised orig="reaso~" auto="true">reason</normalised> they can produce for it.<lb/>
To Sacrifices taken improperly &amp; metaphorically, the<lb/>
circumstances of Altars (which relate still to true Sacrifices)<lb/>
are no way <choice ana="illegible">

                  </choice> had Prayers and Oblations)<lb/>
take them for Sacrifices, or build an Altar for<lb/>
them? saith Dr. Kellison. Which puts me in <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised><lb/>

                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
of one Argument, wherewith I will conclude this<lb/>
Passage. God would not suffer the first Age of<lb/>
the world, for 1650 <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>, to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> away without<lb/>
Prayers, Praises, and Thanksgivings unto him; but<lb/>
he <normalised orig="suffer'd" auto="true">suffered</normalised> it to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> without any Altars: <choice ana="illegible">

                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
of Noahs being the first that ever was built, as<lb/>
learned men are of opinion. Therefore these duties<lb/>
may be still performed without Altars. And<lb/>
consequently, if after all this search in the Collects<lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised>, you can <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> the Vicar nothing,<lb/>
but Prayers, Praises, Thanksgiving, and Commemorations;<lb/>
the holy Table, in the place where it stood,<lb/>
will serve for all these, without erecting or directing<lb/>
this new Altar. But what if I <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> you<lb/>
<normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> Altars for all these <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> Sacrifices, in<lb/>
the ancient Fathers, will you promise not to disturb<lb/>
the peace of the Church any more? Or if this<lb/>
be too much for you to perform, will you have a<lb/>
better opinion of the Writer of the Letter, and suffer<lb/>
the <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> man to procure, if he can, so <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> a<lb/>
Vicaridge as your friends was, to be quiet in? Is it<lb/>
not a very little one? It is but a piece of a piece of a<lb/>
piece of a Benefice: And therefore I will presume<lb/>
upon your <normalised orig="kindnesse" auto="true">kindness</normalised> therein, and set you up all the<lb/>
Altars that God ever required for these <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> of<lb/>
Sacrifices. The first, is the <normalised orig="Councell" auto="true">Council</normalised> of the Saints<lb/>
and the Church of the first begotten; a most fitting<lb/>

And this is Ignatius his Altar. The second,<lb/>

is mounted up from the <normalised orig="Kitchin" auto="true">Kitchen</normalised> to the Great<lb/>
Chamber, and confutes no longer a private Monition<lb/>
sent to a Vicar, but Archbishop Cranmer,<lb/>
Bishop <normalised orig="Iewel" auto="true">Jewel</normalised>, <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> Calvin (a greater stickler, then<lb/>
ever I heard before, in our Upper and Lower<lb/>
house of Parliament) the Acts of <normalised orig="Counsell" auto="true">Counsel</normalised> made for<lb/>
the Reformation, the Lords <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> and <normalised orig="temporall" auto="true">temporal</normalised>,<lb/>
with the <normalised orig="Commonalty" auto="true">Commonality</normalised>, that confirmed our present<lb/>
<normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised>; not forbearing to <normalised orig="jeere" auto="true">jeer</normalised> and deride<lb/>
both them and King Edward (whom the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Iudicious" auto="true">Judicious</normalised> Divine indeed <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> call Saint Edward)<lb/>
in a most <normalised orig="prophane" auto="true">profane</normalised> and abominable fashion.<lb/>
                  <pb n="16"/>
                  <lb/>
First therefore he fall upon a <normalised orig="solemne" auto="true">solemn</normalised> Act of<lb/>
the King and <normalised orig="Counsell" auto="true">Counsel</normalised>, mentioned by <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> Fox,<lb/>
upon this occasion The writer of the Letter observes<lb/>
that in Saxony and other parts of Germany,<lb/>
the Popish Altars upon the Reformation, being permitted<lb/>
to stand, were never esteemed (call them<lb/>
by what name you will) any otherwise then as so<lb/>
many Tables of Stone or Timber; the Sacrifice of<lb/>
those Popish Altars being now abolished. Which<lb/>
words, I perceive, the Writer had translated in a<lb/>
manner from a learned Lutheran. And that<lb/>
these sacrifices were abolished, D. Coal <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> already<lb/>
confessed, pronouncing him for no <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised> of<lb/>
the Church of England, that presumes to offer them. Yet<lb/>
the Writer alleging the fourth Reason given by<lb/>
the King and <normalised orig="Counsell" auto="true">Counsel</normalised>, for their taking away in<lb/>
England, That the form of an Altar being ordained<lb/>
for the Sacrifices of the Law, and both the Law and<lb/>
the Sacrifices thereof now ceasing (in Christ) the<lb/>
Form of the Altar ought to cease also; D. Coal makes<lb/>
nothing of this Reason; but pities the simplicity<lb/>
of the Times, as not being able to distinguish between<lb/>
the Sacrifices of the Law, and the Sacrifices<lb/>
of the Altar. I pray you good <normalised orig="Doctour" auto="true">Doctor</normalised> where may<lb/>
we read of this Term of yours, Sacrifices of the Altar,<lb/>
if we do not read of it in the Sacrifices of the Law?<lb/>
For surely all Sacrifices that wee read of in Scripture,<lb/>
none excepted, were necessarily to be destroyed.<lb/>
And besides the Sacrifices of the Law, we <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> of<lb/>
no Sacrifice that was destroyed, but that one you<lb/>
wot of, offered up upon the <normalised orig="Crosse" auto="true">Cross</normalised>, and not upon<lb/>
an Altar. Beside that, the Apostles and Writers of the<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="116">P2</fw>
                  <pb n="17"/>
                  <lb/>
New Testament, by the <normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised> instinct of the holy<lb/>
Ghost, did purposely <normalised orig="forbeare" auto="true">forbear</normalised> to insert into their Writings<lb/>
the name of an Altar, if we may <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> Bellarmine.<lb/>
And in the ancient Fathers you shall not <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised><lb/>
your Sacrifice of the Altar, terminis terminantibus,
                  <lb/>
how ever you may have found it foisted into their<lb/>
Indexes by some Priests and <normalised orig="Iesuits" auto="false">Jesuits</normalised>. And Mornay<lb/>
<normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised>, with a great <normalised orig="deale" auto="true">deal</normalised> of probability,<lb/>
that the ancient Fathers could not possibly take<lb/>
any notice of this Sacrifice of the Altar. What then?<lb/>
are you Christians to <normalised orig="performe" auto="true">perform</normalised> no manner of Sacrifices<lb/>
at all? No, not at all, saith Arnobius. Not<lb/>
any <normalised orig="corporeall" auto="true">corporeal</normalised> Sacrifice; but <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> praise and <normalised orig="hymnes" auto="true">hymns</normalised>,<lb/>
saith Lactantius.And if some of the Fathers<lb/>
had used those <normalised orig="termes" auto="true">terms</normalised> (as they have done others<lb/>
of as high expressions) yet are there divers<lb/>
reasons given by our gravest Divines, why wee<lb/>
should <normalised orig="forbeare" auto="true">forbear</normalised> in this <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> the <normalised orig="terme" auto="true">term</normalised> of Sacrifice.<lb/>
 Christ and his Apostles did <normalised orig="forbeare" auto="true">forbear</normalised> it, and<lb/>
therefore our Faith may stand without it.  The <normalised orig="speaches" auto="true">speeches</normalised><lb/>
of the Fathers in this <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> are <normalised orig="darke" auto="true">dark</normalised> and obscure,<lb/>
and consequently <normalised orig="unusefull" auto="true">unuseful</normalised> for the edifying of the people.<lb/>
 Lastly, we <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> by experience, that this very expression<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been a great fomenter of Superstition and Popery.<lb/>
And all these inconveniences have sprung from the<lb/>
words, not from the meaning of any of the fathers.<lb/>
But the <normalised orig="Doctour" auto="true">Doctor</normalised> <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> found it in the Bible for all<lb/>
this, Hebr. 13.10. <quote type="biblical" ana="Heb 13.10">We have an Altar.</quote> And although<lb/>
this be but one, and that (God he <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised>) a very<lb/>
lame <normalised orig="souldier" auto="true">soldier</normalised>; yet like an Irish Captain, he brings<lb/>
him in in three <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> disguises, to <normalised orig="fil" auto="true">fill</normalised> up his <normalised orig="companie" auto="true">company</normalised>;<lb/>
in front, in the middle, and in the end of<lb/>
                  <pb n="18"/>
                  <lb/>
his Book. But in good faith, if S. Paul should <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised><lb/>
a <normalised orig="materiall" auto="true">material</normalised> Altar for the Sacrament in that place,<lb/>
(with all reverence to such a chosen <normalised orig="Vessell" auto="true">Vessel</normalised> of the<lb/>
Holy Ghost be it spoken) it would prove the weakest<lb/>
Argument that ever was made by so strong<lb/>
an Artist. We have an Altar, and a Sacrifice of the<lb/>
Altar, that you of the Circumcision may not<lb/>
partake of. Have you so? And thats no great<lb/>
wonder (may the <normalised orig="Iew" auto="true">Jew</normalised> reply) when abundance of<lb/>
you Christians, may not your selves partake thereof.<lb/>
For in the old time, as one observes, they<lb/>
were not borne, but made Christians. Made by<lb/>
long and wearisome steps and degrees, and forced<lb/>
                  NoValue, to <normalised orig="creepe" auto="true">creep</normalised> on with<lb/>
time and leisure to the <normalised orig="bosome" auto="true">bosom</normalised> of the Church,<lb/>
saith the <normalised orig="Generall" auto="true">General</normalised> <normalised orig="Councell" auto="true">Council</normalised>.  They were<lb/>
taught in some private house, the vanity of their<lb/>
<normalised orig="Paganisme" auto="true">Paganism</normalised>, without so much as daring to peep into<lb/>
the Church-porch.  They were admitted to be<lb/>
hearers <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, and that at a very far and remote distance.<lb/>
They were licenced to bend the knee, and<lb/>
to <normalised orig="joyne" auto="true">join</normalised> in some Prayers with the Congregation.<lb/>
 They had leave granted them to become Competents,<lb/>
<normalised orig="suiters" auto="true">suitors</normalised> and petitioners for the Sacrament<lb/>
of <normalised orig="Baptisme" auto="true">Baptism</normalised>.  And then, after many months,<lb/>
nay <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> expectation, being <normalised orig="baptized" auto="true">baptised</normalised>, they were<lb/>
enrolled in the number of the <normalised orig="Faithfull" auto="true">Faithful</normalised>, and never<lb/>

                  </choice> admitted to the least interest of the Sacrament<lb/>
of the Supper. And therefore for S. Paul<lb/>
to frighten the <normalised orig="Iewes" auto="true">Jews</normalised> with the <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised> of that, which<lb/>
so many millions of Christians were themselves<lb/>
bereaved of, had been a very <normalised orig="weake" auto="true">weak</normalised> and feeble dehortation.<lb/>

                  <lb/>
I am sure this fellow is a mighty <normalised orig="weake" auto="true">weak</normalised><lb/>
piece, to take up this leaden Dagger, which the<lb/>
Papists themselves have <normalised orig="throwne" auto="true">thrown</normalised> away, as of no<lb/>

This place is <normalised orig="brutisly" auto="false">brutishly</normalised> abused, to prove that the Christians<lb/>
have a <normalised orig="materiall" auto="true">material</normalised> Altar, saith D. Fulk, Who<lb/>
is of so shallow a brain, as not to discern the notorious<lb/>
unconscionablenesse of your Disputers, who allege<lb/>
the word Altar in the Text to the Hebrews, for proof<lb/>
of a proper Altar? saith a Reverend Bishop.<lb/>
And (for varieties sake) take you one of another<lb/>
Sect: Let the Reader observe, how not childishly<lb/>
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, but absurdly also the <normalised orig="Iesuites" auto="true">Jesuits</normalised> apply this place to<lb/>
prove a <normalised orig="reall" auto="true">real</normalised> Altar. But to put your mouth into<lb/>
relish again, I will conclude with S. Ambrose:<lb/>
That we have nothing visible in all this disputation<lb/>
of S. Paul, neither Priest, nor Sacrifice, nor yet<lb/>
Altar. And if these people be Brutes, <normalised orig="brainlesse" auto="true">brainless</normalised>,<lb/>
childish and absurd, who (grant them but their<lb/>

                  <lb/>

If these (I say) be to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> so termed, what a Brute<lb/>
is this wrangler then, who would have an Altar<lb/>
he knows not for what! For he would have an<lb/>
Altar, i.e, a Communion-Table; and a Sacrifice,<lb/>
i.e. a Memory; and a Priest, i.e. not derived<lb/>
from Sacerdos for all that. So that I <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> not<lb/>
know how to resemble this Doctrine fitter, then<lb/>
to that which a <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised> Mountebank in France<lb/>

You shall be perfect whole, I know not when.<lb/>
And yet for all that, if we talk of a Helena indeed,<lb/>
this one place of the Epistle to the Hebrews,<lb/>
is the Helena of all this sort of people. This they<lb/>
hug and clip and <normalised orig="kisse" auto="true">kiss</normalised>: And above all indeed, S.<lb/>
Paul in his <quote type="biblical" ana="Heb 13.10">
                     <lb/>
                     HABEMUS <normalised orig="ALTARE" auto="true">ALTAR</normalised>.
                     <lb/>
                  </quote> Lord<lb/>
how the man melts upon it. And presently after<lb/>
follow those <normalised orig="patheticall" auto="true">pathetic</normalised> words, Hæc est illa Helena
                  <lb/>
And yet, God <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised>, they have of theirs,<lb/>
but as Paris had of his Helena (or rather of her<lb/>
Statue <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, her person being <normalised orig="seiz'd" auto="true">seized</normalised> upon<lb/>
by Proteus in Egypt) NoValue a most<lb/>
cold and uncomfortable <normalised orig="embracement" auto="true">embrace</normalised>, and as Gulielmus<lb/>
Parisiensis speaks of a like fancy, Chimæram<lb/>
                     <pb n="21"/>
                     <lb/>
Chimærissimam, the very Chimera of all Chimeraes.<lb/>
For I will be bold (not without some premeditation)<lb/>
to make all these <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> observations<lb/>
upon this passage.<lb/>
First, that this is the first <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised> of the reformed<lb/>
Church of England, that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="presum'd" auto="true">presumed</normalised> openly<lb/>
to expound this place, of a <normalised orig="materiall" auto="true">material</normalised> Altar:<lb/>
Yet not constantly neither: For he <normalised orig="confesseth" auto="true">confesses</normalised>, for<lb/>
all his love to this Text, that the Apostle may<lb/>
<normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> there the Lords Table, or the Sacrifice it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>,<lb/>
which the Lord once offered. And so a great Scholar<lb/>
indeed of this Church <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> expounded it.<lb/>
For the Altar in the old Testament is by Malachy<lb/>
called <quote type="biblical" ana="Mal 1.7">
                     <lb/>
                     MENSA DOMINI.
                     <lb/>
                  </quote> And of the Table,<lb/>
in the New Testament, by the Apostle it is<lb/>
said, <quote type="biblical" ana="Heb 13.10">
                     <lb/>
                     HABEMUS <normalised orig="ALTARE" auto="true">ALTAR</normalised>.
                     <lb/>
                  </quote> The Altar in<lb/>
the old, the Table in the new Testament (if we will<lb/>
<normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> with that great personage, properly and<lb/>
Theologically.) And this is the exposition of<lb/>
Peter Martyr, mentioned in the Letter, which this<lb/>
squeamish Gentleman could by no <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> understand:<lb/>
That as sometimes a Table is put for an<lb/>
Altar, as in the first of Malachy; so sometimes<lb/>
an Altar may be put for a Table, as in this Epistle<lb/>
to the Hebrews. Than the which solution there<lb/>
may be peradventure a more full, (for the <normalised orig="Crosse" auto="true">Cross</normalised><lb/>
of Christ is more oppositely <normalised orig="aim'd" auto="true">aimed</normalised> at in that Text,<lb/>
than the holy Table) but there cannot be a more<lb/>
<normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised> and conceivable Answer. And whereas it<lb/>
is <normalised orig="infer'd" auto="true">inferred</normalised>, that then at the least S. Paul <normalised orig="conceiv'd" auto="true">conceived</normalised> the<lb/>
name of an Altar neither to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> improper, nor impertinent<lb/>
in the Christian Church; there is no man<lb/>
                  <pb n="22"/>
                  <lb/>
ever made doubt thereof, so as it be taken, as S.<lb/>
Paul takes it, Metaphorically, and by way of Allusion,<lb/>
but not materially, for this <normalised orig="Church-Vtensill" auto="false">church-utensil</normalised>;<lb/>
which is the thing that lies before us upon the<lb/>
Carpet at this time.<lb/>
Secondly, I do observe, that (Sedulius <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised><lb/>
excepted) no writer before the beginning of the<lb/>
Reformation, did literally, and in the first place,<lb/>
but Allegorically <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, and in the second place of<lb/>
their exposition, by way of use (as it were) and<lb/>
accommodation, bend this Text to the <normalised orig="Materiall" auto="true">Material</normalised><lb/>
Altar. So Theophylact expounds it, first, of the<lb/>
Tenets and Observations of the Christians; Remigius<lb/>
and Haymo (who seem to be but two Friars<lb/>
under one hood) of the <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> of the Passion; Anselme,<lb/>
of Christ himself; <normalised orig="Cardinall" auto="true">Cardinal</normalised> Contaren, of the<lb/>
Passion: and in the second place <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, of the Eucharist:<lb/>
making the debauchery of a Christian<lb/>
man, to be the Service of the Tabernacle, which<lb/>
hinders him from the worthy participation of<lb/>
this <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> Sacrifice. Which clearly implies<lb/>
a continued Allegory.<lb/>
Thirdly, setting by the <normalised orig="Jesuites" auto="true">Jesuits</normalised> on the one side,<lb/>
as Salmeron, the Rhemists, A Lapide,Haræus,Tirinus,<lb/>
Gordon, and Menochius (and Cajetan, a <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised><lb/>
of <normalised orig="Controversie-man" auto="false">Controversy-man</normalised>) who expound it pointblank<lb/>
for a <normalised orig="materiall" auto="true">material</normalised> Altar; and all the Reformed<lb/>
Expositours, on the other side, <normalised orig="aswell" auto="true">as well</normalised> Lutherans<lb/>
(who minister the Communion upon Stone-Altars)<lb/>
as Calvinists, who utterly disallow of that<lb/>
exposition; I do observe, that the most learned of<lb/>
all the <normalised orig="Romane" auto="true">Roman</normalised> Writers, even <normalised orig="sithence" auto="true">since</normalised> the stirring<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="122">Q</fw>
                  <pb n="23"/>
                  <lb/>
of these Controversies, do expound it either of<lb/>
Christ himself, his <normalised orig="crosse" auto="true">cross</normalised>, or his profession; as Bellarmine,<lb/>
the Antididagma of Coleine, Catharinus,<lb/>
and Estius: As you may see more at large in the<lb/>
learned Bishop.<lb/>
Fourthly and lastly, I do observe, that all <normalised orig="Antiquitie" auto="true">Antiquity</normalised>,<lb/>
besides these, do not in the exposition<lb/>
of this Text, reflect in any kind upon the <normalised orig="materiall" auto="true">material</normalised><lb/>
Altar. <normalised orig="Chrysostome" auto="true">Chrisostome</normalised> expounds it of NoValue,<lb/>
of the things professed here amongst us; Oecumenius,<lb/>
                  NoValue the Tenets, as it were, of Christian<lb/>
men; Peter Lombard, of Christs Body; Aquinas,<lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Crosse" auto="true">Cross</normalised>; Gorran, of the Incarnation;<lb/>
and Lyra, of the Passion of our Saviour. Not any<lb/>
one ancient Writer (beside Sedulius) that<lb/>
next his heart, as it were, and in his first exposition,<lb/>
did ever touch upon this <normalised orig="materiall" auto="true">material</normalised> Altar.<lb/>
I do not except Oecumenius or Haymo, mistaken<lb/>
herein by a learned <normalised orig="Doctour" auto="true">Doctor</normalised>. And therefore,<lb/>
good <normalised orig="Doctour" auto="true">Doctor</normalised> (<normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> you mean to turn Jesuite)<lb/>
leave off your cracking to your Novices of this<lb/>
place, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> you be able to back it with better<lb/>
<normalised orig="Authoritie" auto="true">Authority</normalised> then your <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> conceptions.<lb/>
For above all indeed S. Paul in his <quote type="biblical" ana="Heb 13.10">
                     <lb/>
                     HABEMUS<lb/>
<normalised orig="ALTARE" auto="true">ALTAR</normalised>
                     <lb/>
                  </quote> is least of all for your <normalised orig="materiall" auto="true">material</normalised><lb/>
Altars.<lb/>
