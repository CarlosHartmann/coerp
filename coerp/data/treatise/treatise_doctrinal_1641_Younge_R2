<normalised orig="Vse" auto="true">Use</normalised> and Application of the former Reason. <lb/>

THese latter Reasons being <normalised orig="dispatcht" auto="true">dispatched</normalised>, <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised> <lb/>
wee to make use of the former; for I may <lb/>
<normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> to have left them, and be gone quite <lb/>
out of sight, though indeed it cannot properly <lb/>
<normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> called a digression: seeing the last point <lb/>
proved, was; That God suffers his children to be persecuted <lb/>
and afflicted for the increase of their patience. <lb/>
First, if God sends these afflictions, either for our <lb/>
Instruction, or Reformation, to <normalised orig="scowre" auto="true">scour</normalised> away the rust <lb/>
of corruption, or to try the truth of our sanctification, <lb/>
either for the increase of our patience, or the exercise <lb/>
of our faith, or the improvement of our <normalised orig="zeale" auto="true">zeal</normalised>, or <lb/>
to provoke our importunity, or for the doubling of <lb/>
our Obligation: seeing true gold <normalised orig="flyes" auto="true">flies</normalised> not the touchstone; <lb/>
let us examine whether we have thus husbanded <lb/>
our afflictions to his glory, and our <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> <lb/>
and everlasting good. I know Gods fatherly chastisements <lb/>
for the time, <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> grievous to the best of his <lb/>

Children; Yea, at first they come upon us, like Sampsons <lb/>

<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not this roaring <normalised orig="Lyon" auto="true">Lion</normalised> prevailed against thy best <lb/>

                  <lb/>
wit, and a Christian will, makes use of any thing: <lb/>
like the little <normalised orig="Bee" auto="true">Be</normalised>, which will not off the meanest <lb/>

Lastly, Saint Paul in this <normalised orig="schoole" auto="true">school</normalised> of Affliction, <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 4.11">will <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> <lb/>

thy profession, thou <normalised orig="wert" auto="true">were</normalised> at the best but a counterfeit, <lb/>
and none of Christs <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> Baud. A little faith, even <lb/>

our enemies, and that it is both hard and happy, not <lb/>
to be the worse with liberty, as the sedentary life is most <lb/>

if God, the all-wise <normalised orig="Physitian" auto="true">Physician</normalised>, <normalised orig="knowes" auto="true">knows</normalised> this <lb/>
the fittest medicine for our <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised> <normalised orig="sicknesse" auto="true">sickness</normalised>, and that we <lb/>
cannot otherwise be cured; if our pride <normalised orig="forceth" auto="true">forces</normalised> God <lb/>
to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> by us, as Sertorius did by his Army, who perceiving <lb/>
his <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised> <normalised orig="puft" auto="true">puffed</normalised> up through many victories, <lb/>
and hearing them boast of their many conquests, led <lb/>
them of purpose into the lap of their enemies, to the end <lb/>
that stripes might <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> them moderation. <lb/>
If this above all will make us pray unto him with <lb/>
heat and fervency; as whither should we <normalised orig="flye" auto="true">fly</normalised> but to <lb/>
our Joshua, when the powers of <normalised orig="darkenesse" auto="true">darkness</normalised>, like mighty <lb/>
Aramites, have besieged us? If ever we will send up <lb/>
our prayers to him, it will be when we are <normalised orig="beleager'd" auto="false">beleaguered</normalised> <lb/>
with evils. <lb/>
If true and saving joy is only the daughter of sorrow; <lb/>
if the security of any people is the cause of their <lb/>
corruption, as no sooner <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> the Holy Ghost in sundry <lb/>

                  <lb/>
places say, Israel had rest; but it is added, They committed <lb/>
<normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised>: Even as standing waters <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> <lb/>
grow <normalised orig="naysome" auto="false">noisome</normalised>, and Vines that grow out at large, become <lb/>
wilde and <normalised orig="fruitlesse" auto="true">fruitless</normalised> in a small time; if it <normalised orig="weanes" auto="false">weans</normalised> <lb/>
us from the love of wordly things, and makes us no <lb/>
<normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> <normalised orig="inamored" auto="true">enamoured</normalised> with heavenly: as Zeno, having but one <lb/>
Fly-boat left him, hearing <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised> that both it and all <lb/>
therein was cast away, said, O Fortune, thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> done <lb/>
well to send me again to our <normalised orig="Schoole" auto="true">School</normalised> of Philosophy: Whereas <lb/>
if we <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> but a little pleasure in our life, wee are <lb/>
ready to <normalised orig="doate" auto="true">dote</normalised> upon it. Every small contentment <normalised orig="glewes" auto="false">glows</normalised> <lb/>
our affections to that we like, neither can we so heartily <lb/>
<normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> of our home above, <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> we are furnished <lb/>
with these worldly contentments: But when God <lb/>
strips us of them, <normalised orig="straightwayes" auto="false">straightways</normalised> our <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> is homeward; <lb/>
if this world may be compared to Athens, of <lb/>
which a Philosopher said, that it was a pleasant City <lb/>
to <normalised orig="travell" auto="true">travel</normalised> through, but not safe to dwell in: if by smarting <lb/>
in our <normalised orig="bodyes" auto="true">bodies</normalised>, states, or names, we are saved from <lb/>
smarting in our <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised>. If it was good for Naaman, <lb/>
that he was a <normalised orig="Leaper" auto="true">Leper</normalised>; good for David, that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was <lb/>
in trouble; good for Bartimeus, that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> was <normalised orig="blinde" auto="true">blind</normalised>; <lb/>
if with that Arthenian <normalised orig="Captaine" auto="true">Captain</normalised>, we should have perished <lb/>
for ever, in case wee had not thus perished for a <lb/>
while; if our peace would have lost us, in case wee <lb/>
had not a little lost our peace: then <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 3.11">refuse not the chastening <lb/>
of the Lord, neither be grieved with his correction</quote>, <lb/>
as Solomon <normalised orig="adviseth" auto="true">advises</normalised>, Proverbs 3. 11. And so much the <lb/>
rather, <lb/>
1. First, because our <normalised orig="strugling" auto="true">struggling</normalised> may aggravate; cannot <lb/>
<normalised orig="redresse" auto="true">redress</normalised> our miseries. <lb/>
2. Secondly, because the Lord will <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> sanctified <lb/>
either of us, or on us; one of the two as Saint Austin <lb/>
<normalised orig="speakes" auto="true">speaks</normalised>. <lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
3. Thirdly, because that is little which thou <normalised orig="sufferest" auto="true">suffer</normalised>, <lb/>

But to leave examples and come to reason, Is it not <lb/>
an evident <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised>, that if the world hates thee, thou art <lb/>

of such a Nazarite? <lb/>
Answer. Yes: The advantage we have by Christ, <lb/>
is more than the <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised> we had by Adam. If Aruis <lb/>

of Carthage and Rome; If some enemies had not contested <lb/>
against the Church, it might have gone worse <lb/>
with the Church. Lastly, suppose our enemies should <lb/>
kill us, they shall not hurt, but pleasure us: yea, even <lb/>
death it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> shall <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> our good. That Red Sea <lb/>

the better for death; yea, <choice ana="illegible">

which <normalised orig="causeth" auto="true">causes</normalised> him to withdraw his blessing <lb/>

it is proper for affliction to harden, and make <lb/>
