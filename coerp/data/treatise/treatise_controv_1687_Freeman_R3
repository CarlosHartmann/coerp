               <p>
                  <lb/>
            Par. SIR. The last time you gave me the freedom<lb/>
to Discourse with you, you said, I<lb/>
remember, That the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church of Christ<lb/>
was made up of all the particular Churches in the<lb/>
World; Pray how come the Romanists to say, that<lb/>
their Church is the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church?<lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. Because they would have us believe that<lb/>
she is the Mistress of all Churches, and that all<lb/>
ought to be in subjection to the Pope as Supreme<lb/>
Head on Earth.<lb/>
            Par. That then is the meaning of some of their<lb/>
late Authors, when they say, That it is not the particular<lb/>
<normalised orig="Diocess" auto="true">Diocese</normalised> or Province of Rome that they call<lb/>
the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, but the Church of Rome, and<lb/>
all that are <normalised orig="join'd" auto="true">joined</normalised> in communion with her, and believe<lb/>
as she believes.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. Yes, it is so: But it's no hard matter to<lb/>
<normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> the weakness and <normalised orig="falshood" auto="true">falsehood</normalised> of this Assertion.<lb/>
            Par. Before you enter upon that, pray inform<lb/>
me, Do not some of the Fathers call the Church of<lb/>
Rome the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church? The Papists tell us so in<lb/>
their Writings.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. Yes, they do, and other Churches are <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised><lb/>
so as well as the Roman, and all by way of distinction<lb/>
from Schismatical and Heretical Churches:<lb/>
So we read of the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church in Smyrna, and<lb/>
the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church in Alexandria, and many others<lb/>
might be <normalised orig="instanc'd" auto="true">instanced</normalised> in: <normalised orig="'Twas" auto="true">It was</normalised> the common<lb/>
Appellation for every Church that held the true <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised><lb/>
Faith: that is, this is a <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, and<lb/>
this Church, with the others that profess the same<lb/>
Faith, is the one <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church.<lb/>
            Par. Why then the Roman Church, provided she<lb/>
held the true <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Faith, with all those in communion<lb/>
with her, and that believe as she believes,<lb/>
might be <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. Yes, if by all that believe as she believes,<lb/>
be limited only to those Articles <normalised orig="contain'd" auto="true">contained</normalised> in Scripture,<lb/>
and <normalised orig="summ'd" auto="true">summed</normalised> up in the Three Creeds, separated<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="20">D</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
from the many gross Errors she has added to<lb/>
them, then the Church of Rome, and all those<lb/>
others, are the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church: But then this is no<lb/>
more than what may be said of any Church as well<lb/>
as the Roman; and the English <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, with<lb/>
all that hold communion with her, is the one <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised><lb/>
Church of Christ on Earth, as well as the Roman<lb/>
<normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>.<lb/>
            Par. I perceive you think they mean something<lb/>
more by believing as she believes, than the Faith <normalised orig="contain'd" auto="true">contained</normalised><lb/>
in the Scriptures.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. No doubt they do; they mean those that<lb/>
<normalised orig="acknowledg" auto="true">acknowledge</normalised> Subjection to her, and believe all at<lb/>
large, what not only the Scriptures, but that Church,<lb/>
pretending to unscriptural Traditions, declares to<lb/>
be Articles of Faith; viz. those Twelve of Pope<lb/>
Pius the 4th; and then the Church of Rome, with<lb/>
all that believe as she believes, is not the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised><lb/>
Church, but very unsound and corrupt parts of it.<lb/>
            Par. Now, Sir, if you please, I'll tell you what I<lb/>
have met with in their late Authors, to prove the<lb/>
Pope to be Supreme, and that the Church is <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>, by agreeing with that of Rome, and yielding<lb/>
Subjection to him.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. Do so, and I'll give you as plain an Answer<lb/>
as I can to them.<lb/>
            Par. They say, that Christ invested St. Peter<lb/>
with a paramount power and jurisdiction, not only<lb/>
above, but over all the rest of the Apostles; and<lb/>
that the Pope derives it from him, as being his Successor.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. This they say, but they cannot prove any<lb/>
thing of it, either that St. Peter was Bishop of Rome,<lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
or had such a power; or if he was Bishop of Rome,<lb/>
and had such a power, that the Pope has an hereditary<lb/>
Right to it.<lb/>
            Par. I have heard it indeed controverted, whether<lb/>
St. Peter was ever Bishop of Rome?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. The matter will bear very well a Dispute:<lb/>
for <normalised orig="tho'" auto="true">though</normalised> St. Peter might be very instrumental in<lb/>
founding and building up that Church; yet it is not<lb/>
very likely he was formally a Bishop of it, it being<lb/>
beneath the Dignity of an Apostle, who, as such,<lb/>
was Bishop of the whole <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, to sit<lb/>
down for some considerable time, Bishop of one part<lb/>
of it: This is such another absurd degradation of<lb/>
him, as to say, the Pope is Rector of some little Parish.<lb/>
            Par. But certainly they have some proof for what<lb/>
they affirm so confidently, and on which they lay<lb/>
so great a stress.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. Their chief proof is out of Eusebius's Chronicle,<lb/>
where he relates, that St. Peter sate at Antioch<lb/>
Seven years; after which he <normalised orig="travell'd" auto="true">travelled</normalised> to Rome,<lb/>
where he resided Five and Twenty years. But this<lb/>
passage is suspected to be put in on design, it being<lb/>
left out in <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>J*s.</sic>
                     <corr>Jos.</corr>
                  </choice> Scaliger's Greek Edition; and indeed<lb/>
seems to be contradicted by Eusebius himself, in his<lb/>
Ecclesiastical History; where he tells us, that St. Peter<lb/>
having <normalised orig="preach'd" auto="true">preached</normalised> the Gospel in Pontus, Galatia, Bithynia,<lb/>
Cappadocia, &amp;c. at the last, or at the end (that<lb/>
is) near the approach of his death, being at Rome,<lb/>
was put to death.<lb/>
            Par. I <normalised orig="observ'd" auto="true">observed</normalised> in your reciting the Testimony<lb/>
out of Eusebius, that St. Peter is said to be Bishop<lb/>
of Antioch, before he came to Rome: It should seem<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="22">D2</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
then, that if Succession gives a Right, the Bishops<lb/>
of Antioch, where St. Peter was first Bishop, have a<lb/>
better plea for the Supremacy than the Bishops of<lb/>
Rome.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. You have <normalised orig="inferr'd" auto="true">inferred</normalised> right: But <normalised orig="tho'" auto="true">though</normalised> both be<lb/>
granted, that St. Peter was Bishop of <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>R*me</sic>
                     <corr>Rome</corr>
                  </choice>, and<lb/>
Succession <normalised orig="conveighs" auto="false">conveys</normalised> a Right, yet neither signify<lb/>
any thing, unless St. Peter himself had such a power;<lb/>
for he could not derive upon them what he had<lb/>
not himself. Let me therefore hear the proofs you<lb/>
were mentioning the Romanists bring for St. Peter's<lb/>
Supremacy of Power and Jurisdiction.<lb/>
            Par. The first and chiefest they urge, is those<lb/>
words of our Saviour, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 16.18">Thou art Peter, and on this<lb/>
rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell<lb/>
shall not prevail against it.</quote> They make a great<lb/>
noise about this, and raise mighty triumphs upon it.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. I know they do; but as great a cry as they<lb/>
make, here is but little <normalised orig="wooll" auto="true">wool</normalised>; and being conscious<lb/>
of the weakness of the Argument; they would<lb/>
help it out with noise and confidence.<lb/>
            Par. But is not, On this Rock, to be understood of<lb/>
St. Peter's Person?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. It's very probable, No: For St. Peter some<lb/>
while after these words spoken, denied his Master,<lb/>
and so for a time denied the Faith; and now if the<lb/>
Church be built on him as the foundation, the<lb/>
foundation failing, the Church for that time must<lb/>
have failed too, contrary to what our Saviour promised,<lb/>
that it should not.<lb/>
            Par. What then is the meaning of it?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. One or both these Two things: (1.) St.<lb/>
Peter's Faith: St. Peter having said before, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 16.16">Thou art<lb/>
                     <pb n="5"/>
                     <lb/>
Christ, the Son of the Living God;</quote> our Saviour <normalised orig="answer'd" auto="true">answered</normalised>,<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 16.18">Thou art Peter, and on this rock,</quote> on this Faith<lb/>
thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> now made profession of, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 16.18">I will build my<lb/>
Church.</quote>(2.) What our Saviour here said of St. Peter,<lb/>
might be said in the name of all the rest of the Apostles;<lb/>
As he made that confession of Faith in the<lb/>
name of them all, so this honourable character<lb/>
might be <normalised orig="conferr'd" auto="true">conferred</normalised> on him in the name of all too;<lb/>
and this seems the more probable, because the same<lb/>
thing, in a manner, is in other places said in common<lb/>
of all of them.<lb/>
            Par. Yet it should seem, that something peculiar<lb/>
is in these words <normalised orig="conferr'd" auto="true">conferred</normalised> on St. Peter: In the<lb/>
foregoing words St. Peter's forwardness and zeal to<lb/>
confess Christ, <normalised orig="appear'd" auto="true">appeared</normalised> above the rest; St. Peter <normalised orig="answer'd" auto="true">answered</normalised><lb/>
and said, Thou art Christ, &amp;c. And therefore<lb/>
why should not some particular <normalised orig="Badg" auto="true">Badge</normalised> of Honour be<lb/>
meant in these words, to be <normalised orig="fixt" auto="true">fixed</normalised> on him, as the reward<lb/>
of it?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. It may be there is; and if any thing, this<lb/>
may be it; That he should have the honour to be<lb/>
the first Founder of the Christian Church, both amongst<lb/>
Jews and Gentiles; Amongst the Jews, when<lb/>
at one Sermon, St. Peter being the first and chief<lb/>
Speaker, no less than Three Thousand were converted<lb/>
to the Faith of Christ: amongst the Gentiles,<lb/>
when he was commanded by God in a Vision, to<lb/>
repair to Cornelius, and to instruct him in the<lb/>
Christian Doctrine, who was the first Convert, we<lb/>
read of, to the Faith of Christ amongst the Gentiles.<lb/>
            Par. You have fully satisfied me, that there is no<lb/>
proof in this Text for St. Peter's Supremacy, and<lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
consequently not for the Pope's, if he be his Successor.<lb/>
Will you give me leave to name another<lb/>
Argument of theirs? They tell us, that St. Peter<lb/>
is always <normalised orig="nam'd" auto="true">named</normalised> first in the Catalogue of the Apostles;<lb/>
and that first does not there <normalised orig="signifie" auto="true">signify</normalised> first in<lb/>
the order of <normalised orig="numbring" auto="true">numbering</normalised>: for then it would have followed,<lb/>
the second, and the third, as the other Apostles<lb/>
are named; but it does not: By first therefore<lb/>
it should seem, is meant, a primacy of power and jurisdiction.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. <normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> true, St. Peter is always set first in the<lb/>
Evangelists Rolls of the Apostles; but he is not so<lb/>
in other places of Scripture, where we find sometimes<lb/>
James, sometimes Paul and Apollo, and sometimes<lb/>
Andrew <normalised orig="numbred" auto="true">numbered</normalised> before him: But let it be<lb/>
granted, that for the most part he is named before<lb/>
the rest of the Apostles, all it can signify is this,<lb/>
That upon the account of the eminency of his Faith,<lb/>
the fervour of his zeal in the Cause of his Master,<lb/>
of his being first called to the Apostolical Office, a<lb/>
primacy of Order and Honour is due to him; And<lb/>
more than this, a primacy of Power and Jurisdiction,<lb/>
it cannot signify, it being so plainly contrary<lb/>
to other Scriptures, and those innumerable.<lb/>
            Par. I was going to desire you, since their Arguments<lb/>
for St. Peter's Supremacy are so weak, to<lb/>
<normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> how strong our proofs are against it.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. To give you them briefly; We find our<lb/>
Saviour investing all the Apostles with equal powers,<lb/>
and deriving on all the same mission which<lb/>
he himself had <normalised orig="receiv'd" auto="true">received</normalised> from God; <normalised orig="impowering" auto="true">empowering</normalised> all<lb/>
to Preach, Plant and Propagate the Faith; to feed<lb/>
and rule the Flock of Christ, committing the same<lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven to one as well as<lb/>
another; breathing the same Holy Ghost on all;<lb/>
forbidding all ambitious attempts amongst them,<lb/>
who should be greatest; promising indifferently to<lb/>
all Twelve Thrones to sit upon, judging the Twelve<lb/>
Tribes of Israel; does not St. Paul say, <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 12.28">Christ set<lb/>
in his Church, first Apostles, secondarily Prophets - ?</quote>
                  <lb/>
He does not say, first St. Peter, but first Apostles,<lb/>
all the Apostles were first. Was not St. Peter so<lb/>
far from challenging, much less exercising any such<lb/>
Superiority over the Apostles, that we find him<lb/>
stiling himself their fellow Presbyter, and submitting<lb/>
to the Orders of the <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised> <normalised orig="Colledg" auto="true">College</normalised>? Besides,<lb/>
are not St. James and St. John said in Scripture<lb/>
to be Pillars, as well as St. Peter? Are not the<lb/>
whole Twelve Apostles equally stiled the Twelve<lb/>
foundations of the New Jerusalem? Does not St.<lb/>
Paul challenge an equality with the chiefest Apostles?<lb/>
And did he not, on occasion, withstand St.<lb/>
Peter to the face, which he neither ought, nor<lb/>
durst to have done, had he been his Superior and<lb/>
Lord?<lb/>
            Par. The proof is clear and full beyond exception;<lb/>
I see plainly the Pope cannot justify his Supremacy<lb/>
by virtue of any right, as St. Peter's Successor.<lb/>
But whence had he it then? How came his<lb/>
Holiness to rise to this height of Power and Dominion?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. The Truth is, how large an Empire <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised><lb/>
his Holiness now claims over all other Churches,<lb/>
his Authority, in the beginning, was no greater<lb/>
than that of his Brother Bishops; the title was the<lb/>
same, and his Holiness lay in common to them all:<lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
A Precedence indeed was given him, because he<lb/>
was Bishop of the Imperial City; Addresses were<lb/>
made to him, because he was near the Court and<lb/>
the Royal presence; Appeals were brought him,<lb/>
because he was powerful, and as able to defend as<lb/>
to determine; And that Church was often made<lb/>
the standard of the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Faith, because for a<lb/>
time it continued pure and <normalised orig="uncorrupt" auto="true">incorrupt</normalised>, whilst almost<lb/>
all others were overgrown with Arianism<lb/>
and other Heresies. But of these Honours that<lb/>
were given him, he made advantage to climb higher;<lb/>
from a Priority of place, he soon <normalised orig="challeng'd" auto="true">challenged</normalised> a<lb/>
superiority of Power; from being next to the Emperor,<lb/>
he <normalised orig="aspir'd" auto="true">aspired</normalised> to be next to God; from being<lb/>
an Arbitrator, he set up for a <normalised orig="Judg" auto="true">Judge</normalised>; and when he<lb/>
was grown so great, that none durst <normalised orig="controul" auto="true">control</normalised> him,<lb/>
he would be an unerring <normalised orig="Judg" auto="true">Judge</normalised>, and grew Infallible.<lb/>
            Par. These, I perceive, were the steps of the<lb/>
Papal Pride and Empire; But I have been told, the<lb/>
Pope was beholding to that bloody Regicide Phocas<lb/>
for the title of Universal Pastor.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. I shall <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> you that presently; but <normalised orig="'twill" auto="true">it will</normalised><lb/>
not be amiss here to inform you, That the Pope's<lb/>
challenging a Supremacy of power over the whole<lb/>
Christian Church, is not only contrary to Scripture,<lb/>
but to the Ancient Canons of the Church.<lb/>
            Par. I have heard and read as much in some of<lb/>
our own Authors; but pray, which are those Canons?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. They are chiefly four; or, if you will, but<lb/>
one, four times repeated and <normalised orig="confirm'd" auto="true">confirmed</normalised>, in the<lb/>
first Four General Councils succeeding one another.<lb/>
            Par. I shall be glad to hear them read in order, if<lb/>
you have them at hand.<lb/>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. I can easily gratify you in this matter: The first<lb/>
is that famous one, the 6th Canon of the first General<lb/>
Council of Nice, <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> by Constantine the Great, Anno<lb/>
<normalised orig="Dom" auto="true">Doom</normalised>. 325. which Decreed, That the Bishop of Alexandria<lb/>
shall have the same power within his Province,<lb/>
as the Bishop of Rome had in his. The words of the<lb/>
Canon are these, Let Ancient Customs still take place,<lb/>
those that are in Egypt, Libya and Pentapolis, That the<lb/>
Bishop of Alexandria have power over all these; because<lb/>
such also is the Custom of the Bishop of Rome.<lb/>
            Par. What do you infer from this Canon?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. I infer that which is obvious to every eye, viz.<lb/>
That the Bp. of Rome had not then an Universal power<lb/>
over all Christian Churches, since the Bp. of Alexandria<lb/>
was to exercise the same jurisdiction in his own<lb/>
Province, as the Bp. of Rome did in his.<lb/>
            Par. <normalised orig="You'l" auto="true">You'll</normalised> be pleased to go on to recite the other<lb/>
Canons you <normalised orig="mention'd" auto="true">mentioned</normalised>?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. The second is, the 3d Canon of the 2d General<lb/>
Council held at Constantinople by the command of Theodosius<lb/>
the Emperor, Anno <normalised orig="Dom" auto="true">Doom</normalised>. 380, which Decreed,<lb/>
That the Bp. of Constantinople, upon the account of its<lb/>
being new Rome, or the Seat of the Empire, should have<lb/>
the <normalised orig="priviledg" auto="true">privilege</normalised> of Honour next to the Bp. of Rome.<lb/>
            Par. How does this Canon make against the Pope's<lb/>
Supremacy?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. As it declares what kind of primacy the Bp. of<lb/>
Rome had above other Bps, and on what bottom it<lb/>
stood; viz. a primacy of Honour, or the first place;<lb/>
and because Rome, of which he was Bp, had been the<lb/>
Imperial City. Now the Council Decreed, That the<lb/>
Bp. of Constantinople should have the same Honour next<lb/>
to him, and for the same Reason; because Constantinople<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="28">E</fw>

was become New <choice ana="illegible">

                     <corr>Rome</corr>
                  </choice>, That is, the Seat of the<lb/>
Empire was <normalised orig="remov'd" auto="true">removed</normalised> thither.<lb/>
            Par. You have made this very plain to me; What is<lb/>
the 3d Canon?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. It is the 8th Canon of the 3d General Council<lb/>
at Ephesus, Anno <normalised orig="Dom" auto="true">Doom</normalised>. 431. It runs thus, Let the same<lb/>
course be <normalised orig="observ'd" auto="true">observed</normalised> in other Diocesses and in all Provinces<lb/>
every where, That none of the holy Bishops seize upon<lb/>
another Province, which was not of old and from the<lb/>
beginning under his power.<lb/>
            Par. This Canon needs no exposition, <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> so evident;<lb/>
Pray, What do the Romanists say to it?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. Some of them deny it to be a Canon of this<lb/>
Council, and (as they usually serve any thing that is<lb/>
against them) have <normalised orig="endeavour'd" auto="true">endeavoured</normalised> to strike it out from<lb/>
amongst the Acts of it. Others say, it respected<lb/>
a particular Case, the exemption of the Cyprian Bps.<lb/>
from the encroachments of the Patriarch of Antioch,<lb/>
who pretended that it <normalised orig="belong'd" auto="true">belonged</normalised> to him to ordain their<lb/>
Metropolitan. Now <normalised orig="tho'" auto="true">though</normalised> this be granted, yet the<lb/>
Decree passing in general words, without any reserve<lb/>
for the Bp. of Rome, must be supposed to conclude him,<lb/>
as well as any other, to be an ambitious Usurper, if he<lb/>
<normalised orig="claim'd" auto="true">claimed</normalised> or <normalised orig="exercis'd" auto="true">exercised</normalised> any jurisdiction over any Church,<lb/>
that was not from the beginning under his power.<lb/>
            Par. This is so full to the purpose, that it may well<lb/>
be the last<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. Yet I told you there was a fourth; <normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> the<lb/>
28th Canon of the 4th General Council Assembled at<lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>Chalced*n</sic>

                  </choice>, Anno <normalised orig="Dom" auto="true">Doom</normalised>. 451, which <normalised orig="ordain'd" auto="true">ordained</normalised>, That the<lb/>
Bp. of Constantinople should enjoy equal <normalised orig="priviledges" auto="true">privileges</normalised> with<lb/>
the Bp. of Rome, there being the same reason for the<lb/>
one as the other, Constantinople then being the Imperial<lb/>
Seat, as Rome had been.<lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
            Par. I dare say the Romanists do not let this Canon<lb/>
pass without some dirt thrown upon it.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. You are a notable guesser; some serve it as<lb/>
they do the forequoted Canon of the General Council<lb/>
of Ephesus, leave it out of their Editions of the Councils;<lb/>
others tell the World, That this Council was not<lb/>
free, and the Canon extorted by tumultuous Importunity,<lb/>
when as all the Fathers testified their owning of<lb/>
it by their Subscriptions; others, That it's spurious,<lb/>
and put in clandestinely; But how then came the<lb/>
Pope's <normalised orig="Legats" auto="true">Legates</normalised>, who were present at the Council, so vehemently<lb/>
to oppose it? Had there been no such Canon,<lb/>
there would have been no need of such an opposition.<lb/>
Others, That the Fathers at this Council <normalised orig="offer'd" auto="true">offered</normalised> the Title<lb/>
of Supreme and Universal Pastor to the Pope; and<lb/>
all, because the persons delegated by the Pope to inform<lb/>
the Council against Dioscorus Patriarch of Alexandria,<lb/>
do in their accusation against him, presume to<lb/>
give their Master that glorious title. All are calumnies<lb/>
to bespatter and bring into discredit a Canon that lies<lb/>
so heavy upon them and their Cause too.<lb/>
            Par. Truly these Canons are very plain and manifest,<lb/>
and fully prove, not only the right of jurisdiction that<lb/>
every Church has over its own Members, but withal,<lb/>
that the Pope has no right of jurisdiction over all. But<lb/>
I think there is no need of such kind of proof, after so<lb/>
express and pregnant an one from Scripture against St.<lb/>
Peter's Supremacy over the rest of the Apostles, on<lb/>
which chiefly the Pope's is grounded.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. It may be not; But the Church of England<lb/>
owning the four first General Councils, and often appealing<lb/>
to them, I was willing to let you see what they<lb/>
say as to this point. Other Canons also there are very<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="30">E2</fw>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
Ancient, founded on the Independent power every<lb/>
Church has over those in Communion with her, forbidding<lb/>
Appeals to be made to <normalised orig="forreign" auto="true">foreign</normalised> and transmarine<lb/>
Churches; requiring, That no person excluded the Communion<lb/>
of one Church, should be <normalised orig="receiv'd" auto="true">received</normalised> by another; But<lb/>
these are enough.<lb/>
            Par. Now, you are among the Ancients, you may<lb/>
please to let me see, what other proof there is in Antiquity,<lb/>
That the Bishops of Rome in the first Ages had<lb/>
no such extravagant Power and Authority over the<lb/>
Church.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. I must do it briefly then; The Bishops of Rome<lb/>
began very early to aspire after it, to discover their<lb/>
ambitious inclinations that way; But they were always<lb/>
withstood, and <normalised orig="censur'd" auto="true">censured</normalised> for it by other Bishops.<lb/>
            Par. Are there many instances of this nature?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. Yes, too many; <normalised orig="I'l" auto="true">I'll</normalised> mention some few, and<lb/>
shall begin with that of Pope Victor, Anno <normalised orig="Dom" auto="true">Doom</normalised>. 196,<lb/>
who, because the Eastern Bishops would not comply<lb/>
with the custom of the Church of Rome, about the<lb/>
time of keeping Easter, rashly and with a Spirit favouring<lb/>
too much of pride and arrogance, threw them<lb/>
under the sentence of Excommunication.<lb/>
            Par. It looks indeed like a very severe censure on so<lb/>
small an occasion.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. <normalised orig="'Twas" auto="true">It was</normalised> thought to be so then by all good men;<lb/>
The whole Christian World was <normalised orig="amaz'd" auto="true">amazed</normalised> at it, and many<lb/>
eminent persons, especially that meek and holy<lb/>
Bishop Irenæus, sharply chid and <normalised orig="rebuk'd" auto="true">rebuked</normalised> him for it.<lb/>
            Par. This Instance I have often met with in our<lb/>
own Authors.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. <normalised orig="I'l" auto="true">I'll</normalised> give you another: <normalised orig="'Twas" auto="true">It was</normalised> not long after<lb/>
this, when the Eastern Churches, and especially those<lb/>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
in <normalised orig="Africk" auto="true">Africa</normalised>, thought it necessary that persons <normalised orig="Baptiz'd" auto="true">Baptised</normalised><lb/>
by <normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised>, should be <normalised orig="Baptiz'd" auto="true">Baptised</normalised> anew; Stephen then<lb/>
Bishop of Rome was so highly <normalised orig="displeas'd" auto="true">displeased</normalised> herewith, that<lb/>
he <normalised orig="declar'd" auto="true">declared</normalised> he would hold no Communion with them,<lb/>
<normalised orig="refus'd" auto="true">refused</normalised> to see and speak with the Bishops that were deputed<lb/>
to give him an account of their practice, and to<lb/>
<normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> their Reasons for it; fell foul on St. Cyprian Bishop<lb/>
of Carthage, and Firmilian Bishop of Cæsarea, and<lb/>
treated both with undecent language on this occasion.<lb/>
            Par. I wonder how these two eminent Bishops resented<lb/>
this hard usage from their Brother-Bishop?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. Very grievously; as they had reason; both<lb/>
<normalised orig="censur'd" auto="true">censured</normalised> him for it as done out of a proud and arrogant<lb/>
Spirit; and St. Cyprian afterwards calling an Assembly<lb/>
of Eighty seven Bishops to Carthage to debate<lb/>
this point, opened the Synod with a notable Speech,<lb/>
taxing the Bishop of Rome with pride and ambition,<lb/>
<normalised orig="shewing" auto="true">showing</normalised> that no one ought to make himself Bishop of<lb/>
Bishops; that all Bishops had equal power in their respective<lb/>
Diocesses, and could no more be <normalised orig="judg'd" auto="true">judged</normalised> by<lb/>
others, than be themselves Judges of others.<lb/>
            Par. I am glad to hear this account of St. Cyprian,<lb/>
because I observe the <normalised orig="Romish" auto="true">Roman</normalised> Authors cite him often<lb/>
on their side.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. I know they do; and many other Fathers also,<lb/>
but with what little reason I shall <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> you presently:<lb/>
However this has brought into my mind, a Saying or<lb/>
two more of St. Cyprians to our purpose; The other<lb/>
Apostles, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> he, were indeed that which Peter was,<lb/>
endowed with equal Consortship of Honour and Power;<lb/>
Again, Our Lord gave to all the Apostles after his resurrection<lb/>
an equal power, saying, As the Father <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> sent<lb/>
me, so send I you. To the same purpose St. Chrysostom,<lb/>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
St. Paul <normalised orig="sheweth" auto="true">shows</normalised>, saith he, that each Apostle did enjoy<lb/>
equal dignity: And yet more clearly, when comparing<lb/>
St. Peter and St. Paul together, he makes St. Paul at<lb/>
least equal in Honour to St. Peter.<lb/>
            Par. These two Instances you have mentioned are<lb/>
very pat to the business; but I have an imperfect remembrance<lb/>
in my head of some Bishop that took upon<lb/>
himself the title of Universal Pastor, and the Bishop<lb/>
of Rome <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> him the forerunner of Antichrist for<lb/>
it; would you'd please to give me an account of that<lb/>
Story?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. I <normalised orig="design'd" auto="true">designed</normalised> to have done it, had you not <normalised orig="mention'd" auto="true">mentioned</normalised><lb/>
it, and <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> this; In the year 589. John Bishop of<lb/>
Constantinople, that he might bear up the better against<lb/>
the growing greatness of the Bishops of Rome, <normalised orig="procur'd" auto="true">procured</normalised><lb/>
for himself in a Synod <normalised orig="conven'd" auto="false">convened</normalised> in that City, about<lb/>
the Cause of Gregory Bishop of Antioch, the title of<lb/>
<normalised orig="Oecumenical" auto="true">Ecumenical</normalised> or Universal Bishop: But this was so passionately<lb/>
resented at Rome, that two Bishops of that<lb/>
See, one after another, Pelagius and Gregory the Great,<lb/>
loaded the Title with all the names of ignominy and<lb/>
reproach that could be invented; and amongst others,<lb/>
stiled it Devilish and Antichristian.<lb/>
            Par. It may be after all this, the Bishop of Constantinople<lb/>
had no ill design in taking the title upon him.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. It does not appear that he had; But as the<lb/>
Roman Empire was then stiled the Universe, or the<lb/>
whole World, and Constantinople the Imperial Seat; so<lb/>
were the Bishops over the great Churches in that Empire,<lb/>
and especially the Bishop of Constantinople the<lb/>
greatest of all, stiled Universal Bishops; so that it<lb/>
should seem the Bishop of Constantinople took up that<lb/>
great title, only the better to correspond with the<lb/>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
greatness of the City <normalised orig="o're" auto="true">o'er</normalised> which he was Bishop.<lb/>
            Par. Then, the Bishop of Constantinople took on him<lb/>
that Title rather as a badge of Honour, than any accession<lb/>
of power.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. Yes surely; For had he <normalised orig="design'd" auto="true">designed</normalised> an unlimited<lb/>
jurisdiction over the whole Church by it, it's not probable<lb/>
that the Eastern Patriarchs and Bishops, that<lb/>
were most of them at that Synod, would have consented<lb/>
to it, and thereby at one cast have thrown away<lb/>
all their power.<lb/>
            Par. I have been told, it's no unusual thing in Antiquity,<lb/>
for a particular Bishop to have the title of<lb/>
Universal of <normalised orig="Oecumenical" auto="true">Ecumenical</normalised> Pastor bestowed upon him;<lb/>
What may be the reason of that?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. I <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> you this the last meeting we had,<lb/>
because every Bishop is Bishop of the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church;<lb/>
and <normalised orig="tho'" auto="true">though</normalised> for the more advantageous governing of it,<lb/>
each Bishop has his part particularly to oversee, yet is<lb/>
he in some measure entrusted with the care of the<lb/>
whole; as the Church is but one, and the Episcopal<lb/>
Office one, yet each Bishop has the whole Episcopal<lb/>
power, and is Bishop of the whole Church.<lb/>
            Par. But if this was all the Bishop of Constantinople<lb/>
<normalised orig="aim'd" auto="true">aimed</normalised> at by that title, viz. greater honour and dignity;<lb/>
calling himself the Universal Bishop, as being Bishop<lb/>
of the Imperial City of the Universe; What<lb/>
made the Bishops of Rome so to storm at it, as you said<lb/>
they did?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. Probably, as may be gathered from the aspiring<lb/>
temper of several of the Bishops of that See, <normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised><lb/>
because they were out-done in their own way, they<lb/>
had been long driving at that title, and another <normalised orig="stept" auto="true">stepped</normalised><lb/>
in before them, and run away with it.<lb/>
                  <pb n="16"/>
                  <lb/>
            Par. <normalised orig="'Twas" auto="true">It was</normalised> not then, I perceive, the title they so<lb/>
much <normalised orig="quarrel'd" auto="true">quarrelled</normalised> with, as the persons that wore it; Had<lb/>
the Bishops of Rome had it <normalised orig="conferr'd" auto="true">conferred</normalised> on them by a<lb/>
Synodical Canon, it would have been but a very becoming<lb/>
and graceful title; but they being past by, and<lb/>
others <normalised orig="crown'd" auto="true">crowned</normalised> with it, it must be proud and ungodly.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. I believe you have <normalised orig="hit" auto="true">it</normalised> it; That, it's very likely,<lb/>
was the true reason of all their spleen and bitterness;<lb/>
The title of Universal Pastor was foul and abominable<lb/>
only, till the Bishops of Rome could get it set on their<lb/>
own heads; for, as much as Pope Gregory <normalised orig="exclaim'd" auto="true">exclaimed</normalised><lb/>
against it, and <normalised orig="condemn'd" auto="true">condemned</normalised> it in the Bishop of Constantinople,<lb/>
His immediate Successor but one, Pope Boniface<lb/>
the third, got it taken from the See of Constantinople and<lb/>
affixt to his own of Rome.<lb/>
            Par. Here was a quick change indeed from one <normalised orig="extream" auto="true">extreme</normalised><lb/>
to the other; one Pope with all his might <normalised orig="rail'd" auto="true">railed</normalised><lb/>
against it, another within Twelve Months with all his<lb/>
<normalised orig="subtilty" auto="true">subtlety</normalised> courted it; Pray, How came Boniface by it?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. After the basest and vilest manner that can be<lb/>
thought of; <normalised orig="'Twas" auto="true">It was</normalised> by flattering and courting the most<lb/>
execrable Phocas, That most barbarous <normalised orig="Traytor" auto="true">Traitor</normalised> and<lb/>
Murderer, who by embruing his hands in the Blood of<lb/>
his Prince, and butchering his Children before his<lb/>
eyes, <normalised orig="possess'd" auto="true">possessed</normalised> himself of his Crown and Dignity.<lb/>
            Par. Certainly, no Christian, much less a Christian<lb/>
Bishop can be <normalised orig="suppos'd" auto="true">supposed</normalised> to fawn on such a Monster of a<lb/>
Man as this Tyrant and Usurper is represented to be.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. Yet no sooner was this abominable wretch in<lb/>
the Throne, but Pope Gregory first, and then Boniface<lb/>
a little after (Sabinian that was Pope betwixt, dying<lb/>
in half a year,) <normalised orig="sooth'd" auto="true">soothed</normalised> and complemented him at that<lb/>
rate, that one would have thought him to have been a<lb/>
Constantine or an <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>Antonin*</sic>

                  <pb n="17"/>
                  <lb/>
            Par. So then by flattering Applications and wicked<lb/>
Compliances, a grant of it was <normalised orig="obtain'd" auto="true">obtained</normalised> from Phocas.<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. Right: Phocas won by the dextrous Addresses<lb/>
and fawning Insinuations of Boniface, puts out at last<lb/>
an Edict peremptorily requiring, that the Church of<lb/>
Rome be <normalised orig="stil'd" auto="true">styled</normalised> and <normalised orig="esteem'd" auto="true">esteemed</normalised> the head of all Churches,<lb/>
and the Pope Universal Bishop.<lb/>
            Par. I perceive they got it basely, and by the Favour<lb/>
of the basest of men; Have their methods been<lb/>
any better to extend and enlarge their power and dominion?<lb/>
            <normalised orig="Min" auto="true">Mine</normalised>. No surely; The Eastern Empire sinking apace<lb/>
by the successful Invasions of the Saracens, and the Western<lb/>
much broken by the irruptions of the Lombards,<lb/>
the Bishops of Rome ever watchful to serve themselves<lb/>
of all occurrences, took the opportunity while the<lb/>
Emperors hands were full, to play a game for themselves;<lb/>
and what by the bounty of some Princes, particularly<lb/>
of Pepin King of France, who gave them the<lb/>
Lands his Father Charles had won from the Lombards;<lb/>
