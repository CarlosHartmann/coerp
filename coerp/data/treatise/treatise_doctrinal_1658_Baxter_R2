be everlastingly shut out of the <lb/>

of justice <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> provoke us to <lb/>
enquire after him that did it, that <lb/>
the evil of the work may <choice ana="illegible">

                  <lb/>
the evil of shame upon the author. <lb/>
If we saw a man killed and <lb/>
cut in pieces by the way, we would <lb/>
presently ask, Oh who did this cruel <lb/>
deed? If the town were wilfully <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
set on fire, you would ask, What <lb/>
wicked wretch did this? So when <lb/>
we read that the most will be firebrands <lb/>
of hell for ever, we must <lb/>
needs think with our selves, How <lb/>
comes this to pass? and who is it <lb/>
long of? Who is it that is so cruel <lb/>
as to be the cause of such a thing <lb/>
as this? And we can meet with <lb/>
few that will own the guilt. It is <lb/>
indeed <normalised orig="confest" auto="true">confessed</normalised> by all that Satan is <lb/>
the cause: but that <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not resolve <lb/>
the doubt, because he is not <lb/>
the principal cause. He <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not <lb/>
force men to sin, but tempt them to <lb/>
it, and leave it to their own wills <lb/>
whether they will do it or not. <lb/>
He <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not carry men to an Alehouse, <lb/>
and force open their <lb/>
mouths, and pour in the drink, <lb/>
nor <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> he hold them that they <lb/>
cannot go to Gods service, nor <lb/>
<normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> he force their hearts from <lb/>
holy thoughts. It <normalised orig="lieth" auto="true">lies</normalised> therefore <lb/>
between God himself and the sinner: <lb/>

                  <lb/>
One of them must needs be <lb/>
the <normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised> cause of all this misery, <lb/>
which ever it is: For there <lb/>
is no other to cast it upon; And <lb/>
God <normalised orig="disclaimeth" auto="false">disclaimed</normalised> it: He will not <lb/>
take it upon him. And the wicked <lb/>
disclaim it usually, and they will <lb/>
not take it upon them. And this is <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Controversie" auto="true">Controversy</normalised> that is here managing <lb/>
in my text. <lb/>
The Lord <normalised orig="complaineth" auto="true">complains</normalised> of the <lb/>
people; and the people think it is <lb/>
long of God. The same <normalised orig="controversie" auto="true">controversy</normalised> <lb/>
is handled Chap. 18. where <lb/>
Verse 25. they plainly say, that <quote type="biblical" ana="Ezek 18.25">the <lb/>
way of the Lord is not equal</quote>; and <lb/>
God saith, It is their <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> that <lb/>
are not equal. So here they say, <lb/>
Verse 19. <quote type="biblical" ana="Ezek 33.10">If our transgressions and <lb/>
our sins be upon us, and we pine away <lb/>
in them, how shall we then live?</quote>
                  <lb/>

die and be miserable, how can <choice ana="illegible">

them to use the means, and if they <lb/>
will not be <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised>, he lets them <lb/>
know that it is long of themselves; <lb/>
and if this will not <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised> them, <lb/>
he will not therefore forbear to <lb/>
punish them: It is He that will be <lb/>
the Judge; and he will Judge <lb/>
them according to their <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised>; <lb/>
They are no Judges of him or of <lb/>
themselves; as wanting authority, <lb/>
and wisdom, and impartiality: Nor <lb/>
is it their cavilling and quarrelling <lb/>
with God that shall serve their <lb/>
turn, or save them from the execution <lb/>
of Justice which they murmur <lb/>
at. <lb/>
The words of this Verse contain, <lb/>
1. Gods purgation or clearing <lb/>
of himself from the blame of <lb/>
their Destruction. This he <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised>, <lb/>
not by disowning his Law, that <lb/>
the wicked shall die, nor by disowning <lb/>

                  <lb/>
his Judgement and Execution <lb/>
according to that Law; or giving <lb/>
them any hope that the Law shall <lb/>
not be executed; But by professing <lb/>
that it is not their death <choice ana="illegible">

                  <lb/>
he takes pleasure in, but their returning <lb/>
rather, that they may live: <lb/>
And this he <normalised orig="confirmeth" auto="true">confirms</normalised> to them <lb/>
by his Oath. 2. An express Exhortation <lb/>
to the wicked to Return; <lb/>
wherein God <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not only <lb/>
Command, but <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised>, and <lb/>
condescend also to reason the case <lb/>
with them, Why they will die? <lb/>
The direct end of this Exhortation <lb/>
is, That they may Turn and <lb/>
Live. The <normalised orig="Secundary" auto="true">Secondary</normalised> or reserved <lb/>
ends, upon supposition that this is <lb/>
not attained, are these two. First <lb/>
to convince them by the means <lb/>
which he used, that it is not long <lb/>
of God if they be miserable. <lb/>
Secondly to convince them from <lb/>
their manifest <normalised orig="wilfulness" auto="true">willfulness</normalised> in rejecting <lb/>
all his commands and <normalised orig="perswasions" auto="true">persuasions</normalised>, <lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
that it is long of themselves: <lb/>
and they die even because <lb/>
they will die. <lb/>
The substance of the Text <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <lb/>
lie in these observations following. <lb/>
<notvariant>Doct</notvariant>. 1. It is the <normalised orig="unchangable" auto="true">unchangeable</normalised> Law <lb/>
of God that wicked men must <lb/>
Turn or <normalised orig="Dye" auto="true">Die</normalised>. <lb/>
<notvariant>Doct</notvariant>. 2. It is the promise of God, <lb/>
that the wicked shall live if they <lb/>
will but Turn. <lb/>
<notvariant>Doct</notvariant>. 3. God <normalised orig="taketh" auto="true">takes</normalised> pleasure in <lb/>
<normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> Conversion and Salvation, <lb/>
but not in their death or damnation. <lb/>
He had rather they would <lb/>
return and live, then go on and <lb/>
die. <lb/>
<notvariant>Doct</notvariant>. 4. This is a most certain <lb/>
truth, which because God would <lb/>
not have men to question, he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
confirmed it to them solemnly by <lb/>
his Oath. <lb/>
<notvariant>Doct</notvariant>. 5. The Lord <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> redouble <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="8">D 4</fw>

                  <lb/>
his commands and <normalised orig="perswasions" auto="true">persuasions</normalised> to <lb/>
the wicked to Turn. <lb/>

                     <corr><notvariant>Doct</notvariant>.</corr>
                  </choice> 6. The Lord <normalised orig="condescendeth" auto="true">condescends</normalised> <lb/>
to reason the case with them, <lb/>
and <normalised orig="asketh" auto="true">asks</normalised> the wicked, Why they <lb/>
will die? <lb/>
<notvariant>Doct</notvariant>. 7. If after all this the wicked <lb/>
will not turn, it is not long <lb/>
of God that they perish, but of <lb/>
themselves: their own <normalised orig="wilfulness" auto="true">willfulness</normalised> <lb/>
is the cause of their damnation, <lb/>
they therefore die, because they <lb/>
will die. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Having laid the Text open before <lb/>
your eyes in these plain propositions, <lb/>
I shall next speak somewhat <lb/>
of each of them in order; <lb/>
though very briefly. <lb/>

If you will believe God, believe <lb/>
this: There is but one of these <lb/>
two <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> for every wicked man, <lb/>
either Conversion or Damnation. <lb/>
I know the wicked will hardly be <lb/>
<normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> either of the truth or <lb/>
Equity of this. No wonder if the <lb/>
Guilty quarrel with the Law. Few <lb/>
men are apt to believe that which <lb/>
they would not have to be true: <lb/>
And fewer would have that to be <lb/>
true which they apprehend to be <lb/>
against them. But it is not <choice ana="illegible">

                  </choice>, that will save the Malefactor. <lb/>

As I need not stay to open these <lb/>
Texts which are so plain, so I think <lb/>
I need not add any more of that <lb/>
multitude which speak the like: <lb/>
If thou be a man that <normalised orig="dost" auto="false">do</normalised> believe <lb/>
the Word of God: here's already <lb/>
enough to <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised> thee, that the <lb/>

You are already brought <lb/>
so far, that you must either confess <lb/>
that this is true, or say plainly, <lb/>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
you will not believe the Word of <lb/>
God. And if once you be come <lb/>
to that pass, there is but small hopes <lb/>
of you: look to your selves as <lb/>
well as you can; for its like you <lb/>
will not be long out of Hell. You <lb/>
would be ready to <normalised orig="flie" auto="true">fly</normalised> in the face <lb/>
of him that should give you the <lb/>
lie: and yet dare you give the <lb/>
lie to God? But if you tell God <lb/>
plainly you will not believe him, <lb/>
blame him not if he never warn <lb/>
you more, or if he forsake you <lb/>
and give you up as hopeless. For <lb/>
to what purpose should he warn <lb/>
you if you will not believe him? <lb/>
should he send an Angel from heaven <lb/>
to you, its seems you would <lb/>
not believe. For an Angel can <lb/>
speak but the Word of God: and <lb/>
if an Angel should bring you another <lb/>

If he be not to be believed, then <lb/>

But let us hear what reason you <lb/>
have, why you will not believe <lb/>
this word of God, which tells us <lb/>
that the wicked must be Converted <lb/>
or condemned? I know your reason; <lb/>
it is because that you judge <lb/>
it unlikely that God should be so <lb/>
unmerciful: you think it cruelty <lb/>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
to damn men everlastingly for so <lb/>

this leads us up to the second <lb/>
thing, which is to <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> the <lb/>
Equity of God in his Laws and <lb/>
Judgements. <lb/>
And first I think you will not <lb/>
deny but that it is most <normalised orig="sutable" auto="true">suitable</normalised> to <lb/>
an immortal soul, to be ruled by <lb/>
Laws that promise an immortal <lb/>
reward, and threaten an endless <lb/>
punishment. Otherwise the Law <lb/>
should not be suited to the nature <lb/>
of the <choice ana="illegible">

were now made that the most <normalised orig="hainous" auto="true">heinous</normalised> <lb/>
crimes shall be punished with <lb/>
an hundred years captivity, this <lb/>
might be of some efficacy, as being <lb/>
equal to our lives. But if there <lb/>
had been no other penalties before <lb/>
the flood, when men lived eight <lb/>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
or nine hundred years, it would <lb/>
not have been sufficient, because <lb/>
men would know that they might <lb/>
have so many hundred years impunity <lb/>
<normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterwards</normalised>. So is it in our <lb/>
present case. <lb/>
2. I suppose you will confess <lb/>
that the promise of an endless and <lb/>
unconceivable glory is not unsuitable <lb/>
to the wisdom of God, or the <lb/>
case of man. And why then should <lb/>
you not think so of the <normalised orig="Threatning" auto="true">Threatening</normalised> <lb/>

3. When you find it in the <lb/>
Word of God that so it is, and so <lb/>
it will be, do you think your selves <lb/>
fit to contradict this Word? Will <lb/>
you call your Maker to the Barr? <lb/>

Die: would it not stick in your <lb/>
mind, and haunt you night and <lb/>
day, so that in your sinning you <lb/>
would remember it, and at your <lb/>
labour you would remember it, as <lb/>
if the voice were still in your ears, <lb/>
Turn or Die. O happy were your <lb/>
souls if it might thus work with <lb/>
you, and never be forgotten, or <lb/>
let you alone, till it have driven <lb/>
home your hearts to God. But if <lb/>
you will cast it out by forgetfulness <lb/>
or unbelief, how can it work to <lb/>
your Conversion and Salvation? <lb/>
But take this with you to <choice ana="illegible">

                  <lb/>
there it will stand as a sealed truth <lb/>
which you shall experimentally <lb/>
know for ever, that there is no <lb/>
other way but Turn or Die. <lb/>
O what's the matter then that <lb/>
the hearts of sinners be not pierced <lb/>
with such a weighty truth! A <lb/>
man would think now, that every <lb/>
Unconverted soul that hears these <lb/>
words, should be pricked to the <lb/>
heart, and think with themselves, <lb/>
This is my own case; and never be <lb/>
quiet till they found themselves <lb/>
converted. Believe it Sirs, this <lb/>
<normalised orig="drowsie" auto="true">drowsy</normalised> careless temper will not <lb/>
last long. Conversion and Condemnation <lb/>
are both of them <lb/>
awakening things; and one of them <lb/>
will make you feel ere long. I can <lb/>
<normalised orig="foretel" auto="true">foretell</normalised> it as truly as if I saw it with <lb/>

The scornful, and the stupid state <lb/>
of sinners will last but a little <lb/>
while. As soon as they either <lb/>
Turn or Die, the presumptuous <lb/>
dream will be at an end, and then <lb/>
their wits and feeling will return. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
BUT I foresee there are two <lb/>
things that are like to harden <lb/>
the unconverted, and make me <lb/>
lose all my labour, except they can <lb/>
be taken out of the way: and <lb/>
that is the misunderstanding of <lb/>
these two words, [The Wicked] <lb/>
and [Turn.] Some will think with <lb/>
themselves, Its true, the wicked <lb/>
must Turn or Die: but <choice ana="illegible">

wicked men think they are not <lb/>
wicked, but are already Converted, <lb/>
we lose all our labour in <normalised orig="perswading" auto="true">persuading</normalised> <lb/>
them to Turn. I shall therefore before <lb/>
I go any further, tell you here <lb/>
who are meant by [the wicked] <lb/>
and who they be that must turn or <lb/>
die; and also what is meant by <lb/>
Turning, and who they be that are <lb/>
truly converted: And this I have <lb/>
purposely reserved for this place, <lb/>
preferring the Method that fits my <lb/>
end. <lb/>
And here you must observe, <lb/>
that in the sense of the Text, a <lb/>
wicked man, and a converted man <lb/>
are contraries. No man is a wicked <lb/>
man that is converted; and no <lb/>
man is a converted man that is <lb/>
wicked: So that to be a wicked <lb/>
man, and to be an unconverted <lb/>
man, is all one. And therefore <lb/>
in opening one we shall open <lb/>
both. <lb/>

                  <pb n="27"/>
                  <lb/>
Before I can tell you what either <lb/>
Wickedness or Conversion is, <lb/>
I must go to the bottom, and fetch <lb/>
up the matter from the beginning. <lb/>
It pleased the great Creator of <lb/>
the world, to make three sorts of <lb/>
living creatures: Angels he made <lb/>
pure Spirits without flesh: and <lb/>
therefore he made them only for <lb/>
Heaven, and not for to dwell on <lb/>
earth. <normalised orig="Bruits" auto="false">Brutes</normalised> were made flesh <lb/>
without immortal souls: and <lb/>
therefore they were made only <lb/>
for earth and not for Heaven. <lb/>
Man is of a middle nature between <lb/>
both, as partaking of both flesh <lb/>
and Spirit; and therefore he was <lb/>
made both for Earth and Heaven. <lb/>
But as his flesh is made to be but a <lb/>
servant to his Spirit, so is he made <lb/>
for earth but as his passage or way <lb/>
to Heaven, and not that this <lb/>
should be his home or happiness. <lb/>
The blessed state that man was <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="29">28</fw>
                  <pb n="28"/>
                  <lb/>
made for, was to behold the Glorious <lb/>
Majesty of the Lord, and to <lb/>
praise him among his holy Angels; <lb/>
and to love him and be filled with <lb/>
his Love for ever. And as this was <lb/>
the End that man was made for, <lb/>
so God did give him means that <lb/>
were fitted to the attaining of it. <lb/>
These means were principally <lb/>
two. First the right Inclination and <lb/>
Disposition of the mind of man. <lb/>
Secondly the right ordering of his <lb/>
life and practice. For the first, <lb/>
God suited the Disposition of man <lb/>
unto his End; giving him such <lb/>
knowledge of God as was fit for <lb/>
his present state, and an Heart <lb/>
Disposed and Inclined to God, in <lb/>
holy Love. But yet he did not fix <lb/>
or confirm him in this condition; <lb/>
but having made him a free agent, <lb/>
he left him in the hands of his own <lb/>
free-will. For the second, God did <lb/>
that which belonged to him; that <lb/>
is, he gave man a perfect Law, requiring <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="30">E 3</fw>
                  <pb n="29"/>
                  <lb/>
him to continue in the <lb/>
Love of God, and perfectly to <lb/>
obey him. By the wilful breach <lb/>
of this Law, man did not only forfeit <lb/>
his hopes of everlasting life, <lb/>
but also turned his heart from <lb/>
God, and fixed it on these lower <lb/>
fleshly things: and hereby did <lb/>
blot out the spiritual Image of <lb/>
God from his soul. So that man <lb/>
did both fall short of the Glory of <lb/>
God, which was his End, and put <lb/>
himself out of the Way by which <lb/>
he should have attained it; and <lb/>
this both as to the frame of his <lb/>
heart and of his life. The holy Inclination <lb/>
and Love of his soul to <lb/>
God, he lost; and instead of it, he <lb/>
contracted an Inclination and <lb/>
Love to the pleasing of his flesh, <lb/>
or carnal-self by earthly things; <lb/>
growing strange to God, and acquainted <lb/>
with the creature: And <lb/>
the course of his life was suited to <lb/>
the Bent and Inclination of his <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="31">30</fw>
                  <pb n="30"/>
                  <lb/>
heart: he lived to his carnal self, <lb/>
and not to God: he sought the <lb/>
creature for the pleasing of his <lb/>
flesh, in stead of seeking to please <lb/>
the Lord. With this Nature or <lb/>
Corrupt inclination we are all now <lb/>
born into the world: For <quote type="biblical" ana="Job 14.4">who <lb/>
can bring a clean thing out of an <lb/>
unclean?</quote> Job 14. 4. As a <normalised orig="Lyon" auto="true">Lion</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a fierce and cruel nature before <lb/>

Adder <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a <normalised orig="venemous" auto="true">venomous</normalised> nature before <lb/>

we have those sinful Natures <lb/>
or Inclinations before we think, or <lb/>
speak, or do amiss. And hence <lb/>
<normalised orig="springeth" auto="true">springs</normalised> all the sin of our lives. <lb/>
And not only so; but when God <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> of his mercy provided us a <lb/>
Remedy, even the Lord Jesus <lb/>
Christ to be the Saviour of our <lb/>

state, and are <normalised orig="loth" auto="true">loath</normalised> to be <lb/>
brought out of it, and therefore <lb/>
                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>
are set against the means of <lb/>
our Recovery; and though <lb/>
custom have taught us to thank <lb/>
Christ for his good will, yet <lb/>
carnal self <normalised orig="perswadeth" auto="true">persuades</normalised> us to <lb/>
refuse his Remedies, and to <lb/>
desire to be excused when we <lb/>
are commanded to take the <lb/>
Medicines which he <normalised orig="offereth" auto="true">offers</normalised>, <lb/>
and are called to forsake all, <lb/>
and follow him to God and <lb/>
Glory. <lb/>
I pray you read over this leaf <lb/>
again and mark it; for in these <lb/>
few words, you have a true Description <lb/>
of our natural state; and <lb/>
consequently of a wicked man. <lb/>
For every man that is in this <lb/>
state of corrupted nature, is a <lb/>
wicked man, and in a state of <lb/>
death. <lb/>
By this also you are prepared <lb/>
to understand what it is to <lb/>
be Converted, to which end <lb/>
you must further know, That <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="33">32</fw>
                  <pb n="32"/>
                  <lb/>
the mercy of God, not willing <lb/>
that man should perish in his <lb/>
sin, provided a Remedy, by causing <lb/>
his Son to take our Nature, <lb/>
and being in one person God <lb/>
and man, to become a Mediator <lb/>
between God and man, and by <lb/>
dying for our sins on the Cross, to <lb/>
ransom us from the curse of God, <lb/>
and the power of the Devil; and <lb/>
having thus Redeemed us, the Father <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> delivered us into his <lb/>
hands as his own. Hereupon the <lb/>
Father and the Mediator do make <lb/>
a New Law and Covenant for <lb/>
man; not like the first which gave <lb/>
life to none but the perfectly obedient, <lb/>
and condemned man for <lb/>
every sin: but Christ <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> made a <lb/>
Law of Grace, or a Promise of <lb/>
Pardon and Everlasting life to all <lb/>
that by true Repentance and by <lb/>
Faith in Christ are Converted unto <lb/>
God. Like an Act of Oblivion <lb/>
which is made by a Prince to a <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="34">E 5</fw>

                  <lb/>
company of Rebels, on condition <lb/>
they will lay down arms and come <lb/>
in, and be loyal subjects for the time <lb/>
to come. <lb/>
But because the Lord <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> <lb/>
that the heart of man is grown so <lb/>
wicked, that for all this men <lb/>
will not accept of the Remedy, <lb/>
if they be left to themselves, <lb/>
therefore the Holy Ghost <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
undertaken it as his office to inspire <lb/>
the Apostles, and seal up <lb/>
the Scripture by Miracles and <lb/>
Wonders, and to illuminate <lb/>
and convert the souls of the <lb/>
Elect. <lb/>
So that by this much you see that <lb/>
as there are three persons in the <lb/>
Trinity, the Father, the Son, and <lb/>
the Holy Ghost, so each of these <lb/>
persons have their several works, <lb/>
which are eminently ascribed to <lb/>
them. <lb/>
The Fathers works were to <lb/>
Create us, to Rule us <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*s</sic>

creatures, by the Law of <lb/>
Nature, and Judge us thereby: <lb/>
And in mercy to provide us a Redeemer <lb/>
when we were lost, and <lb/>
to send his Son, and accept his <lb/>
Ransom. <lb/>
The works of the Son for us <lb/>
were these, To Ransom and Redeem <lb/>
us by his Sufferings and <lb/>
Righteousness; to give out the <lb/>
Promise or Law of Grace, and <lb/>
Rule and Judge the world as their <lb/>
Redeemer, on terms of Grace, <lb/>
and to make intercession for us, <lb/>
that the benefits of his death may <lb/>
be communicated; and to send <lb/>
the Holy Ghost (which the Father <lb/>
also <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> by the Son.) The <lb/>
works of the Holy Ghost for us <lb/>
are these: to indite the Holy <lb/>
Scriptures, by inspiring and guiding <lb/>
the Prophets and Apostles, and <lb/>
sealing the Word by his Miraculous <lb/>
gifts and works; and the illuminating <lb/>
and exciting the ordinary <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="36">35</fw>
                  <pb n="35"/>
                  <lb/>
Ministers of the Gospel, and <lb/>
so enabling them and helping them <lb/>
to publish that Word: and by the <lb/>
same word Illuminating and Converting <lb/>
the souls of men. So that <lb/>
as you could not have been reasonable <lb/>
creatures, if the Father had <lb/>
not Created you, nor have had <lb/>
any access to God, if the Son had <lb/>
not Redeemed you; so neither can <lb/>
you have a part in Christ, or be saved, <lb/>
except the Holy Ghost do <normalised orig="sanctifie" auto="true">sanctify</normalised> <lb/>
you. <lb/>
So that by this time you may see <lb/>
the several causes of this work. <lb/>
The Father <normalised orig="sendeth" auto="true">sends</normalised> the Son: the <lb/>
Son <normalised orig="Redeemeth" auto="true">Redeems</normalised> us, and <normalised orig="maketh" auto="true">makes</normalised> <lb/>
the Promise of Grace: the Holy <lb/>
Ghost <normalised orig="inditeth" auto="false">indited</normalised> and <normalised orig="sealeth" auto="true">seals</normalised> this Gospel: <lb/>
the Apostles are the Secretaries <lb/>
of the Spirit, to write it: <lb/>
the Preachers of the Gospel do <lb/>
proclaim it, and <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> men to <lb/>
obey it. And the Holy Ghost <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <lb/>
make their preaching effectual, by <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="37">36</fw>
                  <pb n="36"/>
                  <lb/>
opening the hearts of men to entertain <lb/>
it. And all this to repair <lb/>
the image of God upon the soul: <lb/>
and to set the heart upon God <lb/>
again, and take it off the creature <lb/>
and carnal self, to which it is revolted; <lb/>
and so to turn the current <lb/>
of the life into an heavenly course, <lb/>
which before was earthly: and all <lb/>
this by the entertainment of Christ <lb/>
by Faith, who is the <normalised orig="Physitian" auto="true">Physician</normalised> of <lb/>
the soul. <lb/>
By this which I have said, you <lb/>
may see what it is to be Wicked, and <lb/>
what it is to be Converted. Which <lb/>
I think will be yet plainer to you if <lb/>
I describe them as consisting of their <lb/>
several parts: and for the first, a <lb/>
wicked man may be known by these <lb/>
three things. <lb/>
First, he is one who <normalised orig="placeth" auto="true">places</normalised> his <lb/>
chief content on earth, and <normalised orig="loveth" auto="true">loves</normalised> <lb/>
the creature more then God, and <lb/>
his fleshly prosperity above the <lb/>
heavenly felicity: He <normalised orig="savoureth" auto="true">savours</normalised> <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="38">37</fw>
                  <pb n="37"/>
                  <lb/>
the things of the flesh, but neither <lb/>
<normalised orig="discerneth" auto="true">discerns</normalised> nor <normalised orig="savoureth" auto="true">savours</normalised> the <lb/>
things of the Spirit: though he <lb/>
will say, that Heaven is better then <lb/>
earth, yet <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> he not really so <lb/>
esteem it to himself. If he might <lb/>
be sure of earth, he would let go <lb/>
heaven, and had rather stay here, <lb/>
then be removed thither. A life <lb/>
of perfect holiness in the sight of <lb/>
God, and in his love and praises <lb/>
for ever in heaven, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not find <lb/>
such liking with his heart, as a life <lb/>
of health, and wealth, and honour <lb/>
here upon earth. And though he <lb/>
<normalised orig="falsly" auto="true">falsely</normalised> profess that he <normalised orig="loveth" auto="true">loves</normalised> God <lb/>
above all, yet indeed he never felt <lb/>
the power of Divine Love within <lb/>
him, but his mind is more set on <lb/>
the world, or fleshly pleasures, <lb/>
then on God. In a word, whoever <lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>Love*h</sic>

                  </choice> earth above heaven, <lb/>
and fleshly prosperity more then <lb/>
God, is a wicked unconverted <lb/>
man. <lb/>
                  <pb n="38"/>
                  <lb/>
On the other side, a Converted <lb/>
man, is illuminated to discern <lb/>
the Loveliness of God: and <lb/>
so far <normalised orig="believeth" auto="true">believes</normalised> the Glory that <lb/>
is to be had with God, that <lb/>
his heart is taken up to it, and <lb/>
set more upon it, then on any <lb/>
thing in this world. He had rather <lb/>
see the face of God and <lb/>
live in his everlasting love and <lb/>
praises, then have all the wealth <lb/>
or pleasure of this world. He <normalised orig="seeth" auto="true">sees</normalised> <lb/>
that all things else are vanity; and <lb/>
nothing but God can fill the soul; <lb/>
and therefore let the world go <lb/>
which way it will, he <normalised orig="layeth" auto="true">lays</normalised> up <lb/>
his treasure and hopes in heaven, <lb/>
and for that he is resolved to let <lb/>
go all. As the fire <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> mount upward, <lb/>
and the Needle that is <lb/>
touched with the load stone still <lb/>
<normalised orig="turneth" auto="true">turns</normalised> to the North: so the <lb/>
Converted soul is <normalised orig="enclined" auto="true">inclined</normalised> unto <lb/>
God. Nothing else can <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised> <lb/>
him; nor can he find any Content <lb/>

                  <pb n="39"/>
                  <lb/>
and Rest but in his Love. In a <lb/>

Esteem and Love God <choice ana="print-error">

                     <corr>better</corr>
                  </choice> then <lb/>
all the world, and the Heavenly <lb/>
felicity is dearer to them then their <lb/>
fleshly prosperity. The proof of <lb/>
what I have said you may find in <lb/>
these places of Scripture, Phil. 3. <lb/>
18, 21. Mat. 6. 19, 20, 21. Col. 3. <lb/>
1, 2, 3, 4. <normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>. 8. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 18, 23. <lb/>
<normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 73. 25, 26. <lb/>
Secondly, a wicked man is one <lb/>
that <normalised orig="maketh" auto="true">makes</normalised> it the principal business <lb/>
of his life to prosper in the <lb/>
world, and attain his fleshly ends. <lb/>
And though he may read, and <lb/>
hear, and do much in the outward <lb/>
duties of Religion, and forbear <lb/>
disgraceful sins, yet this is all but <lb/>
upon the by, and he never makes <lb/>
it the trade and principal business <lb/>
of his life to Please God and attain <lb/>
everlasting glory, but puts off <lb/>
God with the leavings of the <lb/>
world, and gives him no more <lb/>
                  <pb n="40"/>
                  <lb/>
service then the flesh can spare: <lb/>
for he will not part with all for heaven. <lb/>
On the contrary, a Converted <lb/>
man is one that makes it the principal <lb/>
care and business of his life to <lb/>
Please God, and to be saved, and <lb/>

Thirdly, the soul of a wicked <lb/>
man did never truly discern and <lb/>
relish the mystery of Redemption, <lb/>
nor thankfully entertain an offered <lb/>
Saviour, nor is he taken up with <lb/>
the love of the Redeemer, nor <lb/>
willing to be ruled by him as the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Physitian" auto="true">Physician</normalised> of his soul, that he may <lb/>
be saved from the guilt and power <lb/>
of his sins, and recovered unto <lb/>
God: but his heart is insensible of <lb/>
this unspeakable benefit, and is quite <lb/>
against the healing means by which <lb/>
he should be recovered. Though <lb/>
he may be willing to be carnally <lb/>
Religious, yet he never <normalised orig="resigneth" auto="false">resigned</normalised> up <lb/>
his soul to Christ, and to the motions <lb/>
and conduct of his Word and <lb/>
Spirit. <lb/>
On the contrary, the Converted <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="43">42</fw>
                  <pb n="42"/>
                  <lb/>
soul having felt himself undone by <lb/>
sin, and perceiving that he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
lost his peace with God, and hopes <lb/>

everlasting misery, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> thankfully <lb/>
entertain the tidings of Redemption, <lb/>
and believing in the <lb/>
Lord Jesus as his only Saviour, <lb/>
<normalised orig="resigneth" auto="false">resigned</normalised> up himself to him for <lb/>
wisdom, righteousness, sanctification <lb/>
and redemption. He <normalised orig="taketh" auto="true">takes</normalised> <lb/>
Christ as the Life of his soul, <lb/>
and <normalised orig="liveth" auto="true">lives</normalised> by him, and <normalised orig="useth" auto="true">uses</normalised> him <lb/>
as his salve for every <choice ana="illegible">

                     <corr>sore</corr>
                  </choice>, admiring <lb/>
the wisdom and Love of God in <lb/>
this wonderful work of mans Redemption. <lb/>
In a word, Christ <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <lb/>
even dwell in his heart by faith, <lb/>
and the life that he now <normalised orig="liveth" auto="true">lives</normalised> is <lb/>
by the Faith of the Son of God, <lb/>

he that <normalised orig="liveth" auto="true">lives</normalised>, as Christ in him. <lb/>
For these, see John 1. 11, 12. &amp;<lb/>
3. 19, 20. <normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>. 8. 9. Phil. 3. 7. <lb/>

1 Cor. 1. 20. &amp;2. 2. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
YOU see now in plain terms <lb/>
from the Word of God, who <lb/>
are the wicked, and who are the <lb/>
Converted. Ignorant people think <lb/>
that if a man be no swearer, nor <lb/>
curser, nor rayler, nor drunkard, <lb/>
nor fornicator, nor extortioner, <lb/>
nor wrong any body in their dealings, <lb/>
and if they come to Church, <lb/>
and say their prayers, these cannot <lb/>
be wicked men. Or if a man that <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been guilty of drunkenness, <lb/>
or swearing, or <normalised orig="gameing" auto="true">gaming</normalised> or the <lb/>
like vices, do but forbear them for <lb/>
the time to come, they think that <lb/>
this is a Converted man. Others <lb/>
think, if a man that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been an <lb/>
enemy and scorner at godliness, do <lb/>
but approve it, and <normalised orig="joyn" auto="true">join</normalised> himself <lb/>
with those that are godly, and be <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="45">44</fw>
                  <pb n="44"/>
                  <lb/>
hated for it by the wicked as the <lb/>
godly are, that this must needs be <lb/>
a Converted man. And some are <lb/>
so foolish as to think they are <lb/>
Converted, by taking up some <lb/>
new and false opinion, and falling <lb/>
into some dividing party, as Anabaptists, <lb/>
Quakers, Papists, or such <lb/>
like. And some think, if they <lb/>
have but been affrighted by the <lb/>
fears of Hell, and had Convictions <lb/>
and Gripes of Conscience, and <lb/>
thereupon have purposed and promised <lb/>
amendment, and taken up a <lb/>
life of Civil <normalised orig="behavour" auto="false">behaviour</normalised>, and outward <lb/>
Religion, that this must <lb/>
needs be true Conversion. And <lb/>
these are the poor deluded souls <lb/>
that are like to lose the benefit of <lb/>
all our <normalised orig="perswasions" auto="true">persuasions</normalised>; and when <lb/>
they hear that the wicked must <lb/>
Turn or Die, they think that this <lb/>
is not spoken to them, for they are <lb/>
not wicked, but are Turned already. <lb/>
And therefore it is that Christ <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="46">45</fw>
                  <pb n="45"/>
                  <lb/>
told some of the Rulers of the <lb/>
Jews, who were graver and civiler <lb/>
then the common people, that <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 21.31">Publicans <lb/>
and Harlots do go into the <lb/>
Kingdom of God before them</quote>, Mat. <lb/>
21. 31. Not that an harlot or gross <lb/>
sinner can be saved without Conversion; <lb/>
but because it was easier <lb/>
to make these gross sinners perceive <lb/>
their sin and misery, and the <lb/>
necessity of a change, when the <lb/>
civiler sort do delude themselves <lb/>
by thinking that they are Converted <lb/>
already, when they be <lb/>
not. <lb/>
O Sirs, Conversion is another <lb/>
kind of work then most are ware <lb/>
of: Its not a small matter to bring <lb/>
an Earthly mind to Heaven, and <lb/>
to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> man the amiable excellencies <lb/>
of God, till he be taken up in <lb/>

<normalised orig="placeth" auto="true">places</normalised> his felicity where he never <lb/>

is in Christ, is a <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Cor 5.17">new creature; old <lb/>
things are past away, behold all <lb/>
things are become new</quote>, 2 Cor. 5. 17. <lb/>
He <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a new understanding, a <lb/>
new will and resolution, new sorrows, <lb/>
and desires, and love, and <lb/>
delight, new thoughts, new speeches, <lb/>
new company (if possible) <lb/>
and a new conversation. Sin that <lb/>
before was a jesting matter with <lb/>
him, is now so odious and terrible <lb/>
to him, that he flies from it as from <lb/>
death. The world that was so <lb/>
lovely in his eyes, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> now appear <lb/>
but as vanity and vexation: God <lb/>
                  <pb n="47"/>
                  <lb/>
that was before neglected, is now <lb/>
the only Happiness of his soul; before <lb/>
he was forgotten, and every <lb/>
lust preferred before him; but now <lb/>
he is set next the heart, and all <lb/>
things must give place to him: <lb/>
and the heart is taken up in the attendance <lb/>
and observance of him: <lb/>
and is grieved when he hides his <lb/>
face, and never thinks it self well <lb/>
without him. Christ himself that <lb/>
was wont to be slightly thought <lb/>
of, is now his only hope and refuge, <lb/>
and he <normalised orig="liveth" auto="true">lives</normalised> upon him as on <lb/>
his daily bread; he cannot pray <lb/>
without him, nor <normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised> without <lb/>
him, nor think, nor speak, nor live <lb/>
without him. Heaven it self that <lb/>
before was <normalised orig="lookt" auto="true">looked</normalised> upon but as a <lb/>
tolerable reserve, which he hoped <lb/>
might serve turn as better then <lb/>
hell, when he could not stay any <lb/>
longer in the world, is now taken <lb/>
for his home, the place of his only <lb/>
Hope and Rest, where he shall <lb/>

                  <pb n="48"/>
                  <lb/>
See, and Love, and Praise that God <lb/>
that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> his heart already. Hell <lb/>
that before did seem but as a bugbear <lb/>
to frighten men from sin, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <lb/>
now appear to be a real misery, <lb/>
that is not to be ventured on, nor <lb/>
jested with. The works of holiness <lb/>
which before he was weary <lb/>
of, and seemed to be more ado <lb/>
then needs, are now both his recreation <lb/>
and his business, and the <lb/>
trade that he lives upon. The Bible <lb/>
which was before to him but almost <lb/>
as a common book, is now as <lb/>
the Law of God, as a Letter written <lb/>
to him from heaven, and subscribed <lb/>
with the name of the Eternal <lb/>
Majesty; it is the Rule of his <lb/>
thoughts, and words, and deeds; <lb/>
the commands are binding, the <lb/>
threats are dreadful, and the promises <lb/>
of it speak life to his soul. <lb/>
The godly that seemed to him but <lb/>
like other men, are now the excellentest <lb/>
and <normalised orig="happyest" auto="true">happiest</normalised> on earth. And <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="50">F</fw>
                  <pb n="49"/>
                  <lb/>
the wicked that were his play-fellows <lb/>
are now his grief: and he <lb/>
that could laugh at their sin, is <lb/>
readyer now to weep for their sin <lb/>
and misery, Psalm 16. 3. &amp;15. 4. <lb/>
Phil. 3. 18. In short, he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> a New <lb/>
End in his thoughts, and a New <lb/>
Way in his endeavours, and therefore <lb/>
his Heart and life is New. <lb/>
Before his Carnal Self was his <lb/>
End; and his pleasure, and worldly <lb/>
Profits, and Credit were his <lb/>
Way: and now God and everlasting <lb/>
Glory is his End: and Christ, <lb/>
and the Spirit, and Word, and Ordinances, <lb/>
Holiness to God, and <lb/>
Righteousness and Mercy to men, <lb/>
these are his Way. Before Self was <lb/>
the chief Ruler, to which the matters <lb/>
of God and Conscience must <lb/>
stoop and give place: and now <lb/>
God in Christ, by the Spirit, Word, <lb/>
and Ministry is the chief Ruler, <lb/>
to whom both Self, and all the <lb/>
matters of Self must give place. <lb/>

So that this is not a change in one <lb/>
or two, or twenty points; but in <lb/>
the whole soul: and the very end <lb/>
and Bent of the Conversation. A <lb/>
man may step out of one path into <lb/>
another, and yet have his face <lb/>
the same way, and be still going towards <lb/>
the same place: but <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> another <lb/>
matter to turn quite back <lb/>
again, and take his journey the <lb/>
clean contrary way to a contrary <lb/>
place. So it is here. A man may <lb/>
turn from drunkenness to thriftiness, <lb/>
and forsake his good fellowship, <lb/>
and other gross disgraceful <lb/>
sins, and set upon some duties of <lb/>
Religion, and yet be going still to <lb/>
the <choice ana="illegible">

                  </choice> End as before, intending <lb/>
his carnal Self above all, and giving <lb/>
it still the Government of his <lb/>
soul. But when he is Converted, <lb/>
this Self is <normalised orig="denyed" auto="true">denied</normalised> and taken <lb/>
down, and God is set up, and his <lb/>
face is turned the contrary way: <lb/>
and he that before was addicted to <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="52">F 2</fw>
                  <pb n="51"/>
                  <lb/>
himself, and lived to himself, is <lb/>
now by Sanctification devoted to <lb/>
God, and <normalised orig="liveth" auto="true">lives</normalised> unto God: before <lb/>
he <normalised orig="asketh" auto="true">asks</normalised> himself, what he <lb/>
should do with his time, his parts, <lb/>
and his estate; and for himself he <lb/>
used them: but now he <normalised orig="asketh" auto="true">asks</normalised> <lb/>
God what he shall do with them, <lb/>
and he <normalised orig="useth" auto="true">uses</normalised> them for him. Before <lb/>
he would Please God so far as <lb/>
might stand with the Pleasure of <lb/>
his flesh, and Carnal Self, but not <lb/>
to any great displeasure of them. <lb/>
But now he will please God, let <lb/>
Flesh and Self be never so much <lb/>
<normalised orig="displeasd" auto="true">displeased</normalised>. This is the great change <lb/>
that God will make upon all that <lb/>
shall be saved. <lb/>
You can say, that the Holy-Ghost <lb/>
is your Sanctifier, but do <lb/>
you know what Sanctification is? <lb/>
Why this is it that I have now <lb/>
opened to you: and every man <lb/>
and woman in the world must <lb/>
have this, or be condemned to everlasting <lb/>

misery. They must Turn or <lb/>
<normalised orig="Dye" auto="true">Die</normalised>. <lb/>
Do you believe all this Sirs, or <lb/>
do you not? Surely you dare not <lb/>
say you do not: For <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> past <lb/>
doubt or <normalised orig="denyal" auto="true">denial</normalised>: These are not <lb/>

that: Papists, and <choice ana="print-error">

But if you do believe this, how <lb/>

and lay to heart these things my <lb/>
self, I should have remained in the <lb/>
dark and selfish state, and have perished <lb/>
for ever: but if he have <lb/>
truly made me sensible of them, <lb/>
it will constrain me to compassionate <lb/>
you, as well as my self: If your <lb/>
eyes were so far opened as to see <lb/>
Hell, and you saw your neighbours <lb/>
that were Unconverted <lb/>
<normalised orig="dragg'd" auto="true">dragged</normalised> thither with hideous cries, <lb/>
though they were such as you accounted <lb/>
honest people on earth, <lb/>
and feared no such matter by <lb/>
themselves; such a sight would <lb/>
make you go home and think of it, <lb/>
and think again; and make you <lb/>
warn all about you as the damned <lb/>
worldling in Luke. 16. 28. would <lb/>
have had his <normalised orig="Brethen" auto="true">Brethren</normalised> warned, lest <lb/>
they come to that place of torment <lb/>

                  <lb/>
Why, faith is a kind of <lb/>
sight; it is the eye of the soul; <lb/>
the Evidence of things <choice ana="print-error">

If I believe God, it is next to seeing: <lb/>
And therefore I beseech you <lb/>
excuse me, if I be half as earnest <lb/>
with you about these matters, as <lb/>
if I had seen them. If I must die <lb/>
to morrow, and it were in my <lb/>
power to come again from another <lb/>
world and tell you what I had <lb/>
seen, would you not be willing <lb/>
to hear me, and would you not believe, <lb/>
and regard what I should tell <lb/>
you? If I might preach one Sermon <lb/>
to you after I am dead, and <lb/>
have seen what is done in the <lb/>
world to come, would you not <lb/>
have me plainly speak the truth, <lb/>
and would you not crowd to hear <lb/>
me? and would you not lay it to <lb/>
heart? but this must not be; <lb/>
God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> his appointed way of <lb/>
teaching you by Scripture and Ministers: <lb/>
and he will not humour <lb/>
                  <pb n="58"/>
                  <lb/>
Unbelievers so far as to send men <lb/>
from the dead to them, and to alter <lb/>
his <normalised orig="establisht" auto="true">established</normalised> way: if any man <lb/>
quarrel with the Sun, God will <lb/>
not humour him so far as to set him <lb/>
up a clearer light. Friends, I beseech <lb/>
you regard me now, as you <lb/>
would do if I should come from <lb/>
the dead to you: for I can give <lb/>
you as full assurance of the truth <lb/>
of what I say to you, as if I had <lb/>
been there and seen it with my <lb/>
eyes: For its possible for one from <lb/>
the dead to deceive you: but Jesus <lb/>
Christ can never deceive you: the <lb/>
Word of God delivered in Scripture, <lb/>
and sealed up by the Miracles <lb/>
and holy workings of the <lb/>
Spirit, can never deceive you. <lb/>
Believe this, or believe nothing. <lb/>
Believe and obey this, or you are <lb/>
undone. Now as ever you believe <lb/>
the Word of God, and as ever <lb/>
you care for the salvation of your <lb/>
souls, let me beg of you this reasonable <lb/>

without any more delay, when <lb/>
your are gone from hence, remember <lb/>
what you heard, and enter into <lb/>
an earnest search of your hearts, <lb/>
and say to your selves, [Is it so <lb/>

humbled within me for my former <lb/>
life? Have I thankfully entertained <lb/>
my Saviour and Lord, that offered <lb/>
himself with pardon and life to my <lb/>
soul? Do I hate my former sinful <lb/>

                  <lb/>
world could spare, and which were <lb/>
the leavings of the flesh. Is my heart <lb/>

And is it now the scope, and design, <lb/>

well to heaven, and see the glorious <lb/>
face of God, and live in his everlasting <lb/>
Love and Praise? And <lb/>
when I sin, is it against the very habitual <lb/>
bent and design of my heart? <lb/>
And do I conquer all gross sins, and <lb/>
am I weary, and willing to be rid of <lb/>
mine infirmities? This is the state <lb/>
of a Converted soul. And thus <lb/>

Is it thus indeed with me, or is it <lb/>
not? Its time to get this doubt resolved, <lb/>
before the dreadful Judge resolve <lb/>
it. I am not such a stranger <lb/>
to my own heart and life, but I may <lb/>
somewhat perceive whether I am <lb/>
thus Converted or not: if I be not, <lb/>
                  <pb n="62"/>
                  <lb/>
it will do me no good to flatter my <lb/>
soul with false conceits and hopes. <lb/>
I am resolved no more to deceive my <lb/>
self; but to endeavour to know <lb/>
truly off or on, whether I be Converted, <lb/>
yea or no; that If I be, I <lb/>
may <normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised> in it, and <normalised orig="glorifie" auto="true">glorify</normalised> my <lb/>
gracious Lord, and comfortably go <lb/>
on till I reach the Crown: and if I <lb/>
am not, I may set my self to beg and <lb/>
seek after the Grace that should convert <lb/>
me, and may turn without any <lb/>
more delay: For if I find in time <lb/>
that I am out of the way, by the <lb/>
help of Christ, I may turn and be <lb/>
recovered; but if I stay till either <lb/>
my heart be forsaken of God in <lb/>
blindness and hardness, or till I be <lb/>
<normalised orig="catcht" auto="true">caught</normalised> away by death, its then too <lb/>
late. There is no place for Repentance <lb/>
and Conversion then; I know <lb/>
it must be now or never.] <lb/>
Sirs, this is my request to you, <lb/>
that you will but take your hearts <lb/>
to task, and thus examine them, <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="64">63</fw>
                  <pb n="63"/>
                  <lb/>
till you see if it may be, whether <lb/>
you are Converted or not? and if <lb/>
you cannot find it out by your <lb/>
own endeavours, go to your Ministers, <lb/>
if they be faithful and experienced <lb/>
men, and desire their assistance. <lb/>
The matter is great; <lb/>
let not bashfulness nor <normalised orig="carelesness" auto="true">carelessness</normalised> <lb/>
hinder you. They are set over <lb/>
you to advise you, for the saving <lb/>
of your souls, as <normalised orig="Physitians" auto="true">Physicians</normalised> advise <lb/>
you for the curing of your bodies. <lb/>
It undoes many thousands that <lb/>
they think they are in the way to <lb/>
salvation, when they are not; and <lb/>
think that they are Converted <lb/>
when it is no such thing. And <lb/>
then when we call to them daily to <lb/>
Turn, they go away as they <lb/>
came, and think, that this concerns <lb/>
not them; for they are turned <lb/>
already, and hope they shall do <lb/>
well enough in the way that they <lb/>
are in, at least if they do pick the <lb/>
fairest path, and avoid some of <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="65">64</fw>
                  <pb n="64"/>
                  <lb/>
the foulest steps, when alas, all <lb/>
this while they live but to the <lb/>
world, and flesh, and are strangers <lb/>
to God and Eternal life, and are <lb/>
quite out of the way to Heaven. <lb/>
And all this is much, because we <lb/>
cannot <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> them to a few serious <lb/>
thoughts of their Condition, <lb/>
and to spend a few hours in the <lb/>
examining of their states. Is there <lb/>
not many a self-deceiving wretch <lb/>
that <normalised orig="heareth" auto="true">hears</normalised> me this day, that never <lb/>
bestowed one hour or quarter <lb/>
of an hour in all their lives, to examine <lb/>
their souls, and try whether <lb/>
they are truly Converted or <lb/>
not? O merciful God, that will <lb/>
care for such wretches that care no <lb/>
more for themselves! and that <lb/>
will do so much to save them from <lb/>
Hell, and help them to Heaven, <lb/>
who will do so little for it themselves. <lb/>
If all that are in the way <lb/>
to Hell, and in a state of damnation, <lb/>
did but know it, they durst not <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="66">65</fw>
                  <pb n="65"/>
                  <lb/>
continue in it. The greatest hope <lb/>
that the Devil <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> of bringing <lb/>
you to damnation without a rescue, <lb/>
is by keeping you blindfold, <lb/>
and ignorant of your state, and <lb/>
making you believe that you may <lb/>
do well enough in the way that <lb/>
you are in. If you knew that <lb/>
you are out of the way to heaven, <lb/>
and were lost for ever if you <lb/>
should die as you are, durst you <lb/>
sleep another night in the state <lb/>
that you are in? durst you live <lb/>
another day in it? Could you <lb/>
heartily laugh or be merry in <lb/>
such a state? What! And not <lb/>
know but you may be <normalised orig="snatcht" auto="true">snatched</normalised> <lb/>
away to hell in an hour! Sure it <lb/>
would constrain you to forsake <lb/>
your former company and courses, <lb/>
and to betake your selves to <lb/>
the <normalised orig="waies" auto="true">ways</normalised> of Holiness, and the <lb/>
Communion of the Saints. Sure <lb/>
it would drive you to cry to God <lb/>
for a new heart, and to seek <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="67">66</fw>
                  <pb n="66"/>
                  <lb/>
help of those that are fit to counsel <lb/>
you. Theres none of you sure <lb/>
that cares not for being damned. <lb/>
Well then, I beseech you presently <lb/>
make enquiry into your hearts, <lb/>
and give them no rest, till you find <lb/>
out your condition, that if it be <lb/>
good, you may <normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised> in it, and <lb/>
go on: and if it be <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised>, you may <lb/>
presently look about you for recovery, <lb/>
as men that believe they <lb/>
must Turn or Die. What say you, <lb/>
Sirs? Will you resolve <choice ana="typeset-error">

                     <corr>and</corr>
                  </choice> promise <lb/>
to be at this much labour for <lb/>
your own souls? Will you fall <lb/>
upon this self examination when <lb/>
you come home? Is my request <lb/>
unreasonable? Your consciences <lb/>
know it is not. Resolve on it <lb/>
then before you stir: Knowing <lb/>
how much it <normalised orig="concerneth" auto="true">concerns</normalised> your <lb/>
souls, I beseech you for the sake of <lb/>
that God that <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> command <lb/>
you, at whose Bar you <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>wiil</sic>
                     <corr>will</corr>
                  </choice> shortly <lb/>
all appear, that you will not deny <lb/>
                  <pb n="67"/>
                  <lb/>
me this reasonable request. <lb/>
For the sake of those souls that <lb/>
must turn or <normalised orig="dye" auto="true">die</normalised>, I beseech you deny <lb/>
me not; even but to make it <lb/>
your business to understand your <lb/>
own Conditions, and build upon <lb/>
sure ground, and know off or on <lb/>
whether you are Converted or no, <lb/>
and venture not your souls on <lb/>
negligent security. <lb/>
But perhaps <normalised orig="you'l" auto="true">you'll</normalised> say, What if <lb/>
we should find our selves yet unconverted; <lb/>
what shall we do then? <lb/>
This question <normalised orig="leadeth" auto="true">leads</normalised> me to my second <lb/>
Doctrine, which will do much <lb/>
to the answering of it, to which I <lb/>
shall now proceed. <lb/>
