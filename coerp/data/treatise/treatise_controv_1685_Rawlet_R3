               <head>Of the fourth Mark of the true Church,<lb/>
that it is <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised>.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
            L. BY your last discourse I am fully satisfied how little<lb/>
reason Papists have to assume and engross to themselves<lb/>
the title of <normalised orig="Catholicks" auto="true">Catholics</normalised>: and that our Church of England<lb/>
is a true and sound part of the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church.<lb/>
And at the same time I do also perceive that the last mark<lb/>
of a true Church <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> as properly belong to it, viz. that it<lb/>
is <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised>.<lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
            T. This is indeed so very plain from what <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised><lb/>
been said under the former head, that I reckon there<lb/>
is little need to spend much time in speaking particularly<lb/>
to it. For, as I have often inculcated, our Church<lb/>
receives all those Doctrines which we are certain were<lb/>
taught by the Apostles, that faith which was delivered<lb/>
by them to the Churches which they planted, as it<lb/>
is to be found at large in their writings; and which is<lb/>
<normalised orig="summ'd" auto="true">summed</normalised> up in that which we call the Apostles Creed,<lb/>
as being the Summary of their Doctrine. All the Articles<lb/>
of this Creed we do <normalised orig="stedfastly" auto="true">steadfastly</normalised> embrace and profess;<lb/>
and that in the plain sense of the words, according<lb/>
to the commonly received interpretation of the<lb/>
Church of Christ, in the first and purest ages. And<lb/>
thus our Doctrine is Apostolical, so also is our Government,<lb/>
our Worship and Administration of the<lb/>
holy Sacraments, and therefore our Church <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> most<lb/>
justly deserve the title of an Apostolical Church.<lb/>
For according to the precepts and example of the<lb/>
Apostles, we worship the true God in the name of<lb/>
his Son Jesus our only Mediator, and that in a language<lb/>
understood by the people. We <normalised orig="baptize" auto="true">baptise</normalised> with<lb/>
water, In the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.<lb/>
And in the Lords-Supper do give both Bread and<lb/>
Wine to the people, according to our Saviours own<lb/>
institution. In a word we preach the very same Faith,<lb/>
the same holiness and righteousness of life which the<lb/>
Apostles did. But on the other hand it's most certain,<lb/>
that as to the chief points wherein the Church of<lb/>
Rome and we differ, the Apostles never delivered<lb/>
those Doctrines, nor <normalised orig="enjoyn'd" auto="true">enjoined</normalised> those practices, which<lb/>
are obtruded upon us by that corrupt Church. They<lb/>
never taught that the Bishop of Rome is the supreme<lb/>
and infallible Head of the Church. They never taught<lb/>
us to pray to Angels or Saints, no not to the Blessed<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
Virgin her self; nor to make Prayers for the Dead,<lb/>
that they might be delivered out of Purgatory; nor<lb/>
to take away the Cup from the Laity, nor to worship<lb/>
the consecrated Host, to adore Images, or to make<lb/>
any use of them in Religious service. These things<lb/>
with many others now used in the Church of Rome<lb/>
were never taught or practised by the Holy Apostles,<lb/>
and therefore so far that Church is not Apostolical.<lb/>
            L. I do verily believe it deserves not that name with<lb/>
respect to those Doctrines and practices wherein it differs<lb/>
from us. But I hear them often making great boasts, that<lb/>
theirs must certainly be an Apostolical Church, because an<lb/>
Apostle himself was once their Bishop, even St. Peter, and<lb/>
he ordained another Bishop to succeed him, and so <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> the<lb/>
succession continued to this day, and therefore sure they must<lb/>
needs be an Apostolical Church.<lb/>
            T. In answer to this, I shall wave the dispute whether<lb/>
indeed St. Peter was ever Bishop of Rome or no;<lb/>
and shall pass by all that may be said of the frequent<lb/>
Schisms which have <normalised orig="happen'd" auto="true">happened</normalised> amongst them, by their<lb/>
having sometimes two or three Popes at once, and<lb/>
that for many years together; nor shall I tell of the<lb/>
fine tricks and <normalised orig="politick" auto="true">politic</normalised> intrigues of the Cardinals at<lb/>
the Election of a Pope; nor of those vile arts which<lb/>
are frequently used by such as aspire to that dignity,<lb/>
all which tends very much to abate their honour, and<lb/>
<normalised orig="shews" auto="true">shows</normalised> how unlike they are to the Apostles, whose<lb/>
Successors they boast themselves to be. But waving<lb/>
these things, let me only desire you to consider how<lb/>
little force there is in this argument to prove their<lb/>
Church to be now Apostolical, that once there was<lb/>
an Apostle Bishop of it, except there still continue<lb/>
with them the same truth of Doctrine and purity of<lb/>
worship which the Apostles did at first teach and establish.<lb/>
For let us grant that St. Peter and St. Paul<lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
with other holy men planted a Church at Rome, yet is<lb/>
it not possible that there as well as at Ephesus, might<lb/>
<normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterwards</normalised> arise men who should teach perverse things (as<lb/>
we find it <normalised orig="exprest" auto="true">expressed</normalised>, Act. 20. 30.)and thereby corrupt<lb/>
the Doctrine of the Gospel? Was it not thus in many<lb/>
other Churches? And may it not be so at Rome too?<lb/>
yea most certainly we know it is so. For though we<lb/>
grant that Church to have <normalised orig="remain'd" auto="true">remained</normalised> for a considerable<lb/>
time pure and uncorrupted, yet for many ages <normalised orig="bypast" auto="false">bypassed</normalised><lb/>
to this very day, there have been such Doctrines<lb/>
and practices currently received and established in that<lb/>
Church as the Apostle never taught to them nor to<lb/>
any others. And with respect to these I say they deserve<lb/>
not the title of an Apostolical Church, <normalised orig="meerly" auto="true">merely</normalised><lb/>
because an Apostle at first planted it, and presided<lb/>
over it. The Papists themselves will not now allow<lb/>
this title to any of the Greek <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>C*urches</sic>
                     <corr>Churches</corr>
                  </choice>, which were<lb/>
planted by the Apostles, because they look upon<lb/>
them as erroneous and schismatical; and certainly<lb/>
they themselves have as little reason to challenge it<lb/>
as any of their neighbours, being at least as <normalised orig="grosly" auto="true">grossly</normalised><lb/>
degenerated as any, though they may have more prosperity<lb/>
and greater numbers of people adhering to<lb/>
them. It is not then so much the sitting in the same<lb/>
Chair, as teaching the same Doctrines with the Apostles,<lb/>
that makes a Bishop to be a true Successor of<lb/>
them. Wherefore those Churches which were planted<lb/>
by holy men after the Apostles were dead and gone,<lb/>
if they receive the same Doctrine, and retain the same<lb/>
worship and Sacraments which the Apostles did, these<lb/>
may most justly be accounted Apostolical Churches,<lb/>
sound members of the One, Holy, <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>, <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised><lb/>
Church of Christ.<lb/>
            L. I think there is great reason so to account them:<lb/>
but it seems very unreasonable that any one Church should<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
stile it self the <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised> Church, so as to exclude all<lb/>
others from that title; especially so unsound a Church as<lb/>
that of Rome, which is at this day so very unlike to what<lb/>
it was in the times of the Apostles.<lb/>
            T. It is indeed every whit as unreasonable as to<lb/>
arrogate to themselves alone the name of <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>,<lb/>
which we discoursed of before. Nay let us suppose<lb/>
that the Bishops of Rome to this very day followed the<lb/>
example of the Apostles, preached the same Doctrine,<lb/>
led the same good lives, and used the same<lb/>
holy worship and discipline, so that their Church indeed<lb/>
deserved to be <normalised orig="own'd" auto="true">owned</normalised> as Apostolical, yet what<lb/>
in reason could be <normalised orig="infer'd" auto="true">inferred</normalised> from hence more than this,<lb/>
viz. that the people in their own <normalised orig="Diocess" auto="true">Diocese</normalised> should be<lb/>
subject to them, and that all other sister Churches<lb/>
ought to give them due respect, and maintain such<lb/>
communion with them as those at a distance are capable<lb/>
of. But it does not in the least follow that the<lb/>
Bishop of Rome is Christs Vicar upon Earth, and their<lb/>
Church the only <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> and <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised> Church, so<lb/>
that none must have this title but those who <normalised orig="inslave" auto="true">enslave</normalised><lb/>
themselves to the Pope.<lb/>
            L. You have said enough to convince me how very<lb/>
absurd it is for the Church of Rome to stile her self the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised> Church, as if there were no other<lb/>
Christians in the world but Papists; yet pray tell me, may<lb/>
not the Church of Rome be reckoned a part of the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised><lb/>
Church?<lb/>
            T. At the best it is but a small part, as I have before<lb/>
told you, and also a very unsound part. Yea I<lb/>
will not doubt to add, that take the Church of Rome<lb/>
even in the largest sense, as comprehending all those<lb/>
that submit to the Pope as Head of the whole Church<lb/>
under Christ, they may justly be reckoned a Schismatical<lb/>
party, dividing themselves from the rest of the<lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> Church, setting up a false Head and <normalised orig="Governour" auto="true">Governor</normalised>,<lb/>
and appointing unlawful terms of communion.<lb/>
And though in this respect the Masters and<lb/>
leaders of the faction are in the greatest guilt, yet<lb/>
the people who are seduced are also more or less<lb/>
guilty, according to the capacity they are in of <normalised orig="geting" auto="true">getting</normalised><lb/>
better information. But yet notwithstanding this<lb/>
schism they are in, and notwithstanding the many errors<lb/>
and abuses that are amongst them, whilst they<lb/>
profess the Christian Religion, and own their Baptism,<lb/>
they may be <normalised orig="allow'd" auto="true">allowed</normalised> the name of Christians,<lb/>
such as belong to the visible Church of Christ. And<lb/>
(how uncharitable <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised> they are to us) I hope there<lb/>
are many good Christians amongst them, who do<lb/>
heartily believe the Gospel, and live in obedience to<lb/>
it, according to their <normalised orig="knowledg" auto="true">knowledge</normalised>, and who on that<lb/>
account may be stiled true members of the <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised><lb/>
Church, as all honest, true hearted Christians are,<lb/>
notwithstandig those errors and faults they may be<lb/>
guilty of, which do not utterly violate their Baptismal<lb/>
Covenant, nor destroy that faith and holiness by<lb/>
which we are united to Christ the Head, and so are<lb/>
living members of his body the Church. But still, I<lb/>
say, this title belongs not to them as they are Papists<lb/>
embracing the peculiar <normalised orig="tenents" auto="true">tenants</normalised> of their own Church,<lb/>
but as they are Christians holding the essential Articles<lb/>
of the Christian Faith, together with our own<lb/>
and all other churches. For as to Popery, it is really<lb/>
a disease, a corruption of the Christian Religion. Yet<lb/>
as a diseased man may have his vitals so sound, that<lb/>
even the Plague or <normalised orig="Leprosie" auto="true">Leprosy</normalised> may not kill him, so may<lb/>
there be some amongst the Papists in whom the great<lb/>
and common truths of Religion may be so deeply implanted,<lb/>
and so faithfully retained and improved, that<lb/>
the disease of Popery may not prove mortal. Whilst<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="47">46</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
they hold the foundation, Jesus Christ and his Gospel,<lb/>
though the hay and stubble which they build upon it<lb/>
shall be burnt, yet may they through the mercy of<lb/>
God in Christ, be saved, so as by fire, that is, with<lb/>
great difficulty, 1 Cor. 3. 11, 12, &amp;c. And their case<lb/>
seems most pitiable, who through the disadvantage of<lb/>
their education, want due means of instruction; and<lb/>
what allowances our gracious God will make on that<lb/>
and the like accounts is fittest for us to leave to his<lb/>
own infinite wisdom: Only let us be careful to regulate<lb/>
our own practices by the plain rule of Gods holy<lb/>
Word, which through his favour we so plentifully<lb/>
enjoy.<lb/>
            L. What you say shall teach me more charity to those<lb/>
of them that are sincere, than they will allow to us. But<lb/>
I do still more and more perceive how little reason there<lb/>
is for my <normalised orig="entring" auto="true">entering</normalised> into communion with that Church, in<lb/>
which there is so great hazard of Salvation, even no<lb/>
more than for my venturing into a Pest-house full of infected<lb/>
persons, because it's possible some of them may have<lb/>
so much strength of nature as to overcome that dangerous<lb/>
distemper.<lb/>
            T. The case is much the same.<lb/>

            L. HE next goes about to vindicate their use of the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised> Tongue in the Mass, and the rest of their<lb/>
Service.<lb/>
            T. And pray what can he <normalised orig="alledge" auto="true">allege</normalised> in vindication of<lb/>
their using this Language, when the people understand<lb/>
it not?<lb/>
            L. Why first he says that the Priestly Garments, and<lb/>
the ceremonies they use may serve to instruct it: for he<lb/>
had before said how useful their ceremonies are for the exciting<lb/>
of devotion; and then for further instruction they<lb/>
must go to Catechisms and Sermons.<lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
            T. They had need to be very ingenious people<lb/>
who can learn from Priests garments and dumb ceremonies<lb/>
what's the meaning of Latin Prayers. Nay<lb/>
their multitude of ceremonies are so far from instructing<lb/>
the ignorant people, that rather they need much<lb/>
instruction to know the meaning of them. And instead<lb/>
of exciting devotion, they rather extinguish<lb/>
and suppress it, by amusing their minds, and pleasing<lb/>
their senses with a great deal of pomp an pageantry.<lb/>
Whatever instructions their Priests may give at Catechisms<lb/>
and Sermons, they are not like to make them<lb/>
understand prayers uttered in a strange language.<lb/>
            L. He further adds that simple ignorant people may<lb/>
easily be mistaken, if these high mysteries were done in the<lb/>
vulgar tongue.<lb/>
            T. A wise method truly, to keep people in ignorance<lb/>
for fear they should run into mistakes: as if a man<lb/>
should blindfold a Travailer to prevent his missing the<lb/>
way. But one would think they should here rather<lb/>
employ themselves in the Catechisms and Sermons<lb/>
they talk of, to give the people due instruction for<lb/>
the preventing those mistakes they seem so much<lb/>
afraid of. Though by the course they take with them,<lb/>
in this and other instances, it's plain enough they are<lb/>
more afraid of the peoples getting too much <normalised orig="knowledg" auto="true">knowledge</normalised>.<lb/>
And no wonder, whilst its a common saying amongst<lb/>
them, that Ignorance is the mother of Devotion;<lb/>
and so truly it is of the devotion, or rather the<lb/>
superstition of the <normalised orig="Romish" auto="true">Roman</normalised> Church, whereas the most<lb/>
clear and solid <normalised orig="knowledg" auto="true">knowledge</normalised> of the will and word of God<lb/>
is the mother of true Christian piety and devotion. But<lb/>
has your Author no better reasons than these for this<lb/>
absurd practice?<lb/>
            L. Other reasons he has, whether better or not, do you<lb/>
<normalised orig="judg" auto="true">judge</normalised>. He says it makes for the union of the Latin Church,<lb/>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
that Priests travailing into other Countries may say Mass<lb/>
where ever they come.<lb/>
            T. Very follicitous they appear for the union of<lb/>
the Latin Church, that is of their own party, and in<lb/>
the mean time care little what divisions they make in<lb/>
the Christian Church for their own carnal ends. But<lb/>
of mighty consequence is this project for union which<lb/>
your Author mentions. For what need is there I beseech<lb/>
you that a Priest in a foreign <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised> should<lb/>
officiate there where they may have Priests of their<lb/>
own to do it? And can there not be union enough betwixt<lb/>
foreign Churches, and the Priests that belong<lb/>
to them, in their profession of the same faith, and<lb/>
owning the same worship, except they speak the same<lb/>
language, and use the very same words. One would<lb/>
think they should rather consult for an union betwixt<lb/>
Priest and people, that they might <normalised orig="joyn" auto="true">join</normalised> together at<lb/>
the same time in the same prayers, but this they regard<lb/>
not. It's enough it seems with them for the people<lb/>
to be spectators only even at <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> prayers as<lb/>
well as at the Communion, though they neither understand<lb/>
the one nor partake of the other. For very<lb/>
usual it is with them for the Priests alone to take the<lb/>
Sacrament, whilst the people stand by and look on: a<lb/>
most corrupt custom and <normalised orig="meer" auto="true">mere</normalised> innovation, contrary<lb/>
to the first institution and design of this holy Ordinance,<lb/>
and to the practice of all antiquity. And as<lb/>
that cannot properly be called a Communion where<lb/>
Priests and people do not communicate together, so<lb/>
neither are those to be stiled common prayers in<lb/>
which they do not <normalised orig="joyn" auto="true">join</normalised> in common. Nor has your<lb/>
Author hitherto produced any thing like a reason for<lb/>
this custom of theirs.<lb/>
            L. And I doubt, <normalised orig="you'l" auto="true">you'll</normalised> think his last argument as weak<lb/>
as any, viz. that the holy Scriptures have been written in<lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
Latin, Greek and Hebrew, these three languages being<lb/>
written upon Christs Cross, they are therefore called Sacred,<lb/>
and its permitted to these three Nations to use them<lb/>
at Mass.<lb/>
            T. I confess I am utterly to seek for the force of<lb/>
this argument, if it be fit to call it so, whilst it argues<lb/>
just nothing to the purpose. The holy Scriptures were<lb/>
written originally in Hebrew and Greek, and have been<lb/>
translated not only into Latin but several other Languages,<lb/>
for the benefit of those of several Nations,<lb/>
who were converted to Christianity, (of which more<lb/>
hereafter) and accordingly they had their worship<lb/>
also celebrated in the same languages which the people<lb/>
understood, as our ancestors in this Kingdom had.<lb/>
And this surely every mans own reason may tell him<lb/>
is most profitable and necessary in order to true devotion,<lb/>
that they may understandingly and affectionately<lb/>
<normalised orig="joyn" auto="true">join</normalised> with the Priest in the <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> worship and service.<lb/>
This you will find <normalised orig="expresly" auto="true">expressly</normalised> delivered by the Apostle<lb/>
Paul himself in 1 Cor. 14. 16, &amp;c.where he disapproves<lb/>
the use of strange Tongues in the Church, as not tending<lb/>
to edification, for that he who understood them<lb/>
not could not say Amen to the Prayers or Praises<lb/>
uttered in those unknown Tongues. As to those three<lb/>
Languages he mentions being written upon the Cross,<lb/>
and therefore <normalised orig="allow'd" auto="true">allowed</normalised> to be used in <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> worship, it<lb/>
is such an idle and insignificant fancy, that I am ashamed<lb/>
to take notice of it. If he had <normalised orig="infer'd" auto="true">inferred</normalised> the quite contrary,<lb/>
that therefore they must not be used, the reason<lb/>
had been every whit as good, that is stark <normalised orig="naught" auto="true">nought</normalised>.<lb/>
But what will not men devise, when they are put to<lb/>
their shifts?<lb/>
            L. I wonder what makes them so stiff in a practice so<lb/>
contrary to Reason, Scripture, and the usage of the Primitive<lb/>
Church.<lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
            T. It is not very <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> to give the reason, since<lb/>
some amongst themselves seem ashamed of it; and<lb/>
many of their Bishops in the Council of Trent desired<lb/>
to have <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Prayers in a known Tongue, but it<lb/>
would not be granted. The reason of which (as of<lb/>
many other corruptions being still continued) seems<lb/>
to be partly from their fear, that if they should make<lb/>
one alteration a great many more would follow: (for<lb/>
if they own themselves to have erred in one thing, why<lb/>
not in more?) and partly to <normalised orig="encrease" auto="true">increase</normalised> the peoples admiration<lb/>
of the Priest and his Prayers: (for the less<lb/>
they understand the more prone they are to admire.)<lb/>
And lastly, perhaps there may be this peculiar reason<lb/>
for it, that hereby the people may more easily be <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised><lb/>
of the efficacy of the Priests words for the<lb/>
working that prodigious miracle of Transubstantiation.<lb/>
For if they should hear him speak only plain<lb/>
words in their own mother-tongue, they could hardly<lb/>
think them of force enough to work such a mighty<lb/>
change, whereas in hard words there may be some<lb/>
hidden virtue which they are not aware of. But let<lb/>
us go on to what follows.<lb/>

               <p>
                  <lb/>
            L. THE next thing my Author attempts to vindicate,<lb/>
is their praying by Beads, which serve to number<lb/>
their Pater Nosters and Ave-Maries; of which as I perceive<lb/>
by him, Sixty three Ave-Maries and Seven Paternosters,<lb/>
and one Creed, make a Bead-roll.<lb/>
            T. Very like, and this number, as I take it, they<lb/>
call our Ladies Crown; and an Hundred and Fifty<lb/>
Ave <normalised orig="Maries" auto="true">Mary's</normalised>, and Fifteen Pater-nosters makes a Rosary,<lb/>
of which there is a kind of Order in their Church,<lb/>
called the Confraternity of the Rosary. Into this Society<lb/>
all manner of people may be admitted, and these<lb/>
(as I find in one of their Authors who gives an account<lb/>
of it) are obliged to say over the whole Rosary<lb/>
once in a week at least. And these Prayers are to be<lb/>
offered up in a certain manner to Almighty God in<lb/>
honour of the Blessed Virgin. Now, lest this should<lb/>
be two burdensome, there is provision made, that if<lb/>
they have any lawful impediment, they may get another<lb/>
to say their Prayers for them, and it shall be accepted.<lb/>
They who enter into this Society, must solemnly<lb/>
devote themselves to the Honour, Love and<lb/>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
Service of the Blessed Virgin: Even as solemnly as a<lb/>
Man can consecrate himself to the Service of Almighty<lb/>
God our Heavenly Father, do they give up themselves<lb/>
to her as the Mother of all Christians: For so<lb/>
they say she is to be esteemed, because our Saviour said<lb/>
of her to St. John, Behold, thy Mother. To each of<lb/>
these Votaries is given by the Father who admits him<lb/>
a set of Beads, which are <normalised orig="Blest" auto="true">Blessed</normalised>, and <normalised orig="Crost" auto="true">Crossed</normalised>, and<lb/>
Sprinkled with Holy-Water. And most wonderful<lb/>
<normalised orig="Priviledges" auto="true">Privileges</normalised> are bestowed by sundry Popes upon those<lb/>
who devoutly recite this Rosary. They may gain a<lb/>
Plenary Indulgence for themselves, and may every day<lb/>
release a Soul out of Purgatory, which surely they are<lb/>
very uncharitable if they will not do. Nay, which<lb/>
seems strangest of all, even those in Purgatory may be<lb/>
admitted into this fraternity, if any particular Friend<lb/>
of theirs on Earth shall desire it; and will perform on<lb/>
their behalf what is required, and so may they share<lb/>
in the merits of the whole Society. Though by the<lb/>
way, I wonder that any body should leave a particular<lb/>
Friend in Purgatory, when he may so easily deliver<lb/>
him thence, as you heard before. But I'le entertain<lb/>
you no longer with this <normalised orig="fulsom" auto="true">fulsome</normalised> ridiculous stuff. Let<lb/>
us return to your Author, and see what he says for<lb/>
this manner of Praying, which a Parrot may go near<lb/>
to learn, and use it with as much devotion as multitudes<lb/>
of them.<lb/>
            L. He says that the Ave-Mary is used Sixty three<lb/>
times, because the Blessed Virgin Mary lived just so many<lb/>
years.<lb/>
            T. A wise Reason truly! But I wonder where he<lb/>
had so good intelligence. Some of her Worshippers<lb/>
it's like have heard it from her own mouth: For heretofore<lb/>
nothing more common than for her to appear<lb/>
to them, and talk familiarly with them, if we may<lb/>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
believe their own Legends, which I confess is somewhat<lb/>
hard to do. Yet I grant there is as much certainty in<lb/>
the story of her Age, as strength in the Argument<lb/>
taken from it, that is just none at all. Why do they not<lb/>
by this Reason say the Lords-Prayer Thirty three times<lb/>
because our Saviour lived so many years? And it<lb/>
might also be asked, why but one Lords-prayer for<lb/>
nine Ave-Maries? But waving these things, let us hear<lb/>
his pretence for this odd way of Praying, by running<lb/>
over the same words so many times together, as if<lb/>
they would make up with the number what they want<lb/>
in weight and devotion; and then telling them by their<lb/>
Beads, as if they were afraid of being someway<lb/>
cheated if they did not keep so exact a reckoning.<lb/>
Certainly we have neither precept nor example in<lb/>
Scripture to recommend such a way of worship.<lb/>
            L. All that he says is, that David said his Prayers<lb/>
Seven times a day, and our Saviour in the Garden repeated<lb/>
three times the same prayer. He demands therefore, whether<lb/>
it be ill to say ones Prayers by number when he has<lb/>
reason so to do?<lb/>
            T. No surely: But when a Man has no reason so to<lb/>
do, it's very vain and absurd. And by all that he <normalised orig="alledges" auto="true">alleges</normalised>,<lb/>
it seems they have no reason, else sure he<lb/>
would have given some. For, I beseech you, where's<lb/>
the consequence, that because David prayed Seven<lb/>
times in a day (that is very often) therefore it's a good<lb/>
thing to repeat one and the same Prayer Seventy times<lb/>
seven in a day, or at least as often as we well can? Or<lb/>
when our Saviour in his Agony <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> with great fervour<lb/>
and affection offer up his Petition to his Father thrice<lb/>
in the same words, which were suitable to his present<lb/>
state, is this any thing like the Papists way of running<lb/>
over an Ave-Mary, Ten, Twenty, Thirty times together,<lb/>
with a Pater-noster now and then intermixed<lb/>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
for variety sake, and this very oft in the midst of<lb/>
company, without the least <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> of devotion, and as<lb/>
I take it, in the <normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised> Tongue, which few of them<lb/>
understand? And which is prettiest of all, when they<lb/>
are <normalised orig="busie" auto="true">busy</normalised> themselves, though it be but at sports and<lb/>
pastimes, they may then get some idle body patter over<lb/>
these their Prayers for them. And I have heard it<lb/>
often reported by those who have conversed much<lb/>
with them, that sometimes two of these devout people<lb/>
will play a game at Cards which shall say Prayers<lb/>
for the other at such a time. So that it seems they<lb/>
take them for a kind of penance, being glad when<lb/>
they are over, as a School-boy when he has done his<lb/>
Task. And is this like the Devotion of the Holy<lb/>
Psalmist, who prayed to God, and praised him with<lb/>
all his Heart and Soul, and sang praises with understanding,<lb/>
and with great affection and delight? Or<lb/>
much less is this like to that of our Blessed Saviour,<lb/>
who <quote type="biblical" ana="Heb 5.7">in the days of his flesh offered up Prayers and Supplications<lb/>
with strong cries and tears</quote>, as we have it, Heb. 5.7.<lb/>
He continued, indeed, sometimes whole nights in<lb/>
Prayer; and his holy Apostles were very constant and<lb/>
frequent in this duty, and have <normalised orig="enjoyned" auto="true">enjoined</normalised> us to <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Thess 5.17">pray<lb/>
continually</quote>, and <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Thess 5.18">in every thing to give thanks.</quote> But do<lb/>
you find them any where directing us to say over the<lb/>
same words so often in an hour or a day? And to make<lb/>
use of a <normalised orig="sett" auto="true">set</normalised> of Beads to keep true reckoning? Is this<lb/>
a Worshipping of God in Spirit and in Truth? Is this<lb/>
like the fervend Prayer of the Righteous, which St.<lb/>
James tells us is so effectual? Is this like the Intercession<lb/>
of Abraham or Moses, the Wrestlings of Jacob, the<lb/>
earnest Prayer of Elias and other holy men recorded<lb/>
in Scripture? Nay, so far is it from being agreeable<lb/>
to such examples, that it seems plainly contrary to<lb/>
our Saviours command, Not to use vain repetitions in<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="146">L</fw>
                  <pb n="16"/>
                  <lb/>
praying, as if we thought to be heard for our much speaking,<lb/>
Matt. 6. 7.<lb/>
            L. So it seems truly, and nothing can be more weak<lb/>
and impertinent than what my Author talks of, saying Five<lb/>
Pater-nosters in honour of our Saviours Five wounds, he<lb/>
means, I suppose, those in his hands and feet, and that on<lb/>
his side: But what he means by our saying the Lords-Prayer<lb/>
in honour to those wounds I cannot well tell.<lb/>
            T. Nor can I resolve you: He might as well talk of<lb/>
saying it Twelve times in honour of the Twelve Apostles;<lb/>
and then Seventy times for the Seventy Disciples:<lb/>
and after that, as oft as you please in honour<lb/>
of what you have a mind to. For they forsooth have<lb/>
a certain peculiar manner of offering up their Prayers<lb/>
to God in honour to other persons and things, which<lb/>
I confess I am utterly ignorant of; nor do I think<lb/>
they themselves can give a rational account of it. Of<lb/>
such blind devotions as these well may Ignorance be accounted<lb/>
the Mother.<lb/>
            L. But my Author is by no means pleased that this way<lb/>
of praying by Beads should be thought fit only for <normalised orig="ideots" auto="true">idiots</normalised><lb/>
that cannot read: For he says that Kings and their Courts,<lb/>
the Pope and his Cardinals make use of Beads, who can<lb/>
read better than Sectaries.<lb/>
            T. There may be some question of that for all <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>h*s</sic>
                     <corr>his</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
confidence, since it's commonly said that the present<lb/>
Pope (though much commended for some other good<lb/>
qualities) can scarce read their <normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised> Service. But<lb/>
let them be able to read never so well, that will hardly<lb/>
prove all good which they do. And if we speak<lb/>
of examples, I must confess I had much rather follow<lb/>
our Saviour and his Apostles than the Pope and his<lb/>
Cardinals.<lb/>
            L. And so had I too: But he says they have Books of<lb/>
Devotion as well as Beads; that both are good, and variety<lb/>
<normalised orig="delighteth" auto="true">delights</normalised>.<lb/>
                  <pb n="17"/>
                  <lb/>
            T. They had need truly to have some variety to<lb/>
refresh them: For sure they can neither have much delight,<lb/>
nor much profit from a tedious repetition of<lb/>
the same words over at the same time, especially<lb/>
whilst some of them understand not what they<lb/>
say, and do also say some such things as would not<lb/>
much help their Devotion though they were understood.<lb/>
            L. He says there can be no better Prayers than the Pater-noster,<lb/>
the Ave, and the Creed.<lb/>
            T. As to the Ave and the Creed, they are no<lb/>
Prayers at all: the former being the Angels Salutation<lb/>
to the Blessed Virgin, Luke 1.28. and it is an absurd<lb/>
piece of superstition to turn it into a Prayer, such as<lb/>
never any Christian was guilty of for many hundred<lb/>
years after that Salutation was first uttered. The<lb/>
Creed contains a confession of our Faith, and though<lb/>
the frequent repetition of it, with serious reflections<lb/>
upon it, may be of great use, viz for the engaging<lb/>
of us to live according to our profession; yet is it by<lb/>
no means a Prayer, nor any thing like one. The Pater-noster,<lb/>
or the Lords-Prayer, is indeed a most admirable<lb/>
form of Prayer, which may not only serve as<lb/>
a pattern to direct us how to pray, but is also most<lb/>
proper and fit to be frequently used as a Prayer, and<lb/>
may very well be <normalised orig="joyn'd" auto="true">joined</normalised> with any other Prayers which<lb/>
we make to Almighty God. But yet we must not<lb/>
think there is any devotion <normalised orig="exprest" auto="true">expressed</normalised>, or any advantage<lb/>
got, by repeating it over so many times in an hour, or<lb/>
a day, as if there were some secret virtue and force<lb/>
in the bare rehearsal of the words, whilst we little<lb/>
or nothing attend to the sense of them; which<lb/>
is fitter for Mag-pies and Parrots than for reasonable<lb/>
creature, from whom God expects a reasonable<lb/>
Service, wherein their Hearts and Souls are<lb/>

                  <fw type="pageNum" n="148">L2</fw>
                  <pb n="18"/>
                  <lb/>
to be employed as well as their Tongues. But let<lb/>
us proceed.<lb/>
