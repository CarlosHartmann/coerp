               <head>1 John 2. 24. former part. <lb/>
                Let that therefore abide in you which <lb/>
                <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> have heard from the beginning.</head>

AMongst all those various broods of<lb/>
Sects that ignorance and <normalised orig="wilfulness" auto="false">willfulness</normalised><lb/>
have spawned in the World, there<lb/>
is none but is covetous that Antiquity<lb/>
should <normalised orig="Patronize" auto="false">Patronise</normalised> it; never decrying its<lb/>
venerable Testimony, nor fearing its oraculous<lb/>
Answers, but when they distrust its<lb/>
votes opposite to their present espousals;<lb/>
Gray hairs being as well the Glory of an<lb/>
Opinion, as the Crown of the Old man.<lb/>
Hence is it that both Nations and Families<lb/>
have had such severe Contests with each<lb/>
other, concerning the time of their first<lb/>
rise, that from thence their <normalised orig="Pedegree" auto="true">Pedigree</normalised> may<lb/>
appear Ancient, and they might gain renown<lb/>
from the date of their Original.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="2">B</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
And as in Persons and Opinions, so in<lb/>
things too, quo antiquius eo melius, by<lb/>
how much the more Ancient a thing is,<lb/>
by so much the more is it prized and valued<lb/>
by those that covet a strict inspection<lb/>
into the Periods that did <normalised orig="preceed" auto="false">proceed</normalised> their<lb/>
own, who measure the proportions of an<lb/>
infant World, and thus antedate their own<lb/>
Beings: How precious is a Script of Trismegistus?<lb/>
Or the least Workmanship of<lb/>
an inspired Bezaleel? The smallest Leaf of<lb/>
Solomon's Herbal would be deemed a Present<lb/>
Noble enough for the greatest Monarch;<lb/>
How do we prize an old piece of<lb/>
Roman Coin? Or an antiquated Grecian<lb/>
Monument? Nor is this a Truth receiving<lb/>
a general impress and confirmation,<lb/>
in respect of Artificial and Philosophical<lb/>
Objects; but even Divinity too, having<lb/>
for its Author the Ancient of Days, values<lb/>
that which carries Age furrowed in its<lb/>
Face, and has Gravity and Years visible on<lb/>
its Brow: And nothing seems more to asperse<lb/>
and disparage whatever wears the<lb/>
Title of Religion than to accuse it of Novity,<lb/>
and to bear the date of a late Invention: <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
Hence Haman endeavoured from<lb/>
this <normalised orig="Topick" auto="true">Topic</normalised> to brand the Jews, in that they<lb/>
used other Customs different from the ancient<lb/>
Laws of the Persians, that their Novelty<lb/>
might render them odious to the<lb/>
King, being a crime it seems sufficient to<lb/>
ruin them, when Mordecai could not bow<lb/>
to so insulting a <normalised orig="Favorite" auto="true">Favourite</normalised>: St. Paul when<lb/>
he Preached the Gospel at Athens, had prejudice<lb/>
raised against the Truth of his Doctrine,<lb/>
by affirming him only to be a setter<lb/>
forth of strange Gods, and introducing<lb/>
new propositions into the World;<lb/>
Celsus when he professedly wrote against<lb/>
the Truth and Divinity of the Christian<lb/>
Institutions, thought he had cast sufficient<lb/>
blemish and contempt upon its Authority,<lb/>
when he had satisfied the World that it<lb/>
was new and unheard of: And Eusebius<lb/>
assures us that it was a common stratagem,<lb/>
and usual contrivance for the Christian Religion<lb/>
from its first entrance, to be reproached<lb/>
with its strangeness and novelty; all<lb/>
mankind (as it seems) measuring the truth<lb/>
of things by their Antiquity, and general<lb/>
reception; and if we approach nearer to<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="4">B 2</fw>

                  <lb/>
our own Confines we shall find the two<lb/>
great <normalised orig="struglers" auto="false">strugglers</normalised> for the Western Empire of<lb/>
Conscience and Religion, still endeavour<lb/>
to Crown their Opinions with old Age, and<lb/>
to gain both Strength and Honour to<lb/>
their Establishment from time and duration.<lb/>
The Romans would have the World<lb/>
to understand that the Pillars of their<lb/>
Church were founded with Christianity, and<lb/>
that our Saviour himself once held those<lb/>
Keys which he afterwards delivered to the<lb/>
Papal Succession. But though they had<lb/>
a firm Foundation, they have built upon<lb/>
it a tottering Superstructure. The Protestant<lb/>
would willingly obliterate the odium<lb/>
of a late Reformation, and will antedate<lb/>
Luther and the German heats, searching<lb/>
in the midst of a bloody Inquisition;<lb/>
some being willing to Travel to<lb/>
Bohemia to derive their Principles from<lb/>
John Hus, and <normalised orig="Jerom" auto="true">Jerome</normalised> of Prague, not only<lb/>
sending us to our own Wiccliffe, but<lb/>
eating through the Mountains to find out<lb/>
the more Ancient (though obscure) Waldenses:<lb/>
others (and that more justly too)<lb/>
as if all this will not yet evince their Principles<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="5">4</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
Aged, will Travel farther to the<lb/>
Churches Cradle, and find out the Manger<lb/>
in which our Saviour himself was laid,<lb/>
and from his Mouth receive their Doctrine,<lb/>
reviving what might seem dead,<lb/>
having for some time been <normalised orig="buryed" auto="true">buried</normalised> in the<lb/>
dust and rubbish of <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> Inventions; and<lb/>
freeing it from those Burdens and Corruptions<lb/>
which a gainful Interest, and<lb/>
bold Presumption had loaded it withal,<lb/>
thus cause that to abide in them which<lb/>
Christians heard from the beginning. <lb/>
Antiquity then being so powerful a motive<lb/>
to persuade to Religion, that all<lb/>
strive to catch and grasp it; I shall easily<lb/>
prevail for a diligent attention since what<lb/>
I deliver shall be that which has been<lb/>
heard from the beginning.<lb/>
In which Text we have an Exhortation<lb/>
both Grave and Seasonable; Grave it is,<lb/>
avoiding those levities and varnish which<lb/>
Novices use to wrap their late and uncouth<lb/>
Opinions in, that they may be snatched<lb/>
at with the more greedy Appetite: As Physicians<lb/>
put their bitter Pills in sweet Conserves<lb/>
that the Patient may swallow them<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="6">5</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
with the greater delight: and seasonable<lb/>
was this advice too; since Simon, and the<lb/>
Gnosticks, did now attempt the murdering<lb/>
Christianity when it was just born; as Herods<lb/>
cruelty, drinking in, with an insatiable<lb/>
thirst, the blood of Infants, would<lb/>
have Crucified our Saviour in his Cradle,<lb/>
before Age had given him Strength and<lb/>
Stature, not only to publish his Fathers<lb/>
Message, but even to bear his own Cross.<lb/>
Nay least this accursed, and Antichristian<lb/>
Sect, provoking their desires to unlawful<lb/>
Lusts, detracting from Christianity by an<lb/>
impious and incoherent intermixture of<lb/>
Jewish and Heathen Rites and Practices,<lb/>
with what was now Solemn in its proposal,<lb/>
and Sacred by its establishment,<lb/>
should not be able to impede, or retard,<lb/>
the most glorious flourish of Gospel<lb/>
Truth, and forbid the spreading of the<lb/>
Christian Church, that Noble Vine but<lb/>
newly Planted; Cerinthus also now advanced,<lb/>
with all the wild Boars of the <normalised orig="Forrest" auto="true">Forest</normalised>,<lb/>
if possibly, to undermine and<lb/>
root her up, denying the Divinity of its<lb/>
first Author: An <normalised orig="Heretick" auto="true">Heretic</normalised> so foul and polluted,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="7">6</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
that the blessed Pen-man of my<lb/>
present Text would not come into the<lb/>
same Bath in which the wicked Cerinthus<lb/>
washed, least he should be defiled with that<lb/>
water which had touched so filthy and<lb/>
loathsome a Carcass; and the Bath it self,<lb/>
sensible of its own pollution, should immediately<lb/>
fall to make a Grave for its self<lb/>
and <normalised orig="possessours" auto="true">possessors</normalised>.<lb/>
In the Exhortation then there are three<lb/>
Parts presented to our view (1.) A Duty,<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Jn 2.24">Let that therefore abide in you,</quote> (2.) Its Object,<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Jn 2.24">Which <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> have heard</quote>;(Lastly) The<lb/>
Motive and Inducement to the Duty, Because<lb/>
it was <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Jn 2.24">from the beginning</quote>.<lb/>
I must crave leave to invert the Parts, <lb/>
though it shall make no alteration in the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Sence" auto="true">Sense</normalised>; that first the Object being explained,<lb/>
and the Motive proposed, the Duty<lb/>
may be with the greater facility pressed<lb/>
and embraced. (1.) Then, Let the Object<lb/>
in the Text <normalised orig="exhibite" auto="true">exhibit</normalised> it self; and this is nothing<lb/>
but what <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> have already heard.<lb/>
As Faith it self is generated by the Ear, so<lb/>
what you have heard is nothing else but the<lb/>
Object of your Faith; for thus does the<lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
Apostle conclude the inference; <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 10.17">Faith<lb/>
<normalised orig="cometh" auto="true">comes</normalised> by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word<lb/>
of God</quote>, (Rom. 10. 17.) But as Hearing is<lb/>
the Conduit to convey Faith, so sometimes<lb/>
is it the decoy to infidelity; because<lb/>
there are many false Prophets gone forth<lb/>
into the World; and a seeming truth<lb/>
may make the same impression with truth<lb/>
it self. Nay, our blessed Saviour, that he<lb/>
might not leave us without due Caution,<lb/>
has informed all Ages and Generations,<lb/>
that there shall arise false Christs, and false<lb/>
Prophets; yea! and shall superadd Wonders<lb/>
to their Oratory, not only to amuse<lb/>
the World, but to gain credit and reputation<lb/>
to their Doctrine; <normalised orig="insomuch" auto="true">inasmuch</normalised> that<lb/>
(if it were possible) they shall prevail to<lb/>
the dismal shaking of the strongest <normalised orig="Oakes" auto="true">Oaks</normalised>,<lb/>
and the rooting up the tallest Cedars of<lb/>
Libanus; even to the putting a falacy upon<lb/>
the very Elect, (Matth. 24.24.) The Ear<lb/>
of Man, being the recepticle of all Sounds,<lb/>
no wonder that it admits the founding<lb/>
Brass and <normalised orig="tinckling" auto="true">tinkling</normalised> Cymbal, as well as<lb/>
the Trumpets of the Sanctuary. Simon<lb/>
Magus may be as welcome to the Samaritans,<lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
as Paul and Barnabas to the Disciples<lb/>
at Antioch. If a vain-glorious Herod<lb/>
has but Confidence enough to make an Oration,<lb/>
though repugnant to the first Principles<lb/>
of Religion, nor wonder that it<lb/>
makes such an impress upon the Multitude,<lb/>
that they give shouts, with the loudest<lb/>
Acclamations, and attribute to him<lb/>
the Wisdom of a Deity, who is scarce endowed<lb/>
with the Prudence of a Man; <lb/>
(Acts 12.22.) If a <normalised orig="mechanick" auto="true">mechanic</normalised> Silversmith,<lb/>
prompted with no other motive than what<lb/>
Avarice and Interest can dictate, shall confidently<lb/>
plead for the Shrines of Diana;<lb/>
the clamorous Multitude shall soon cry<lb/>
out, <quote type="biblical" ana="Acts 19.28">Great is Diana of the Ephesians</quote>, (Act.<lb/>
19.28.) So easily captivated are vulgar<lb/>
Affections, and of so slender a value is popular<lb/>
Applause. The mutable <normalised orig="Croud" auto="true">Crowd</normalised> will<lb/>
change their Religion with their Garments,<lb/>
and is of that still which is of the newest<lb/>
fashion. As if novitas essendi were the Being<lb/>
of Devotion, and Age were not the<lb/>
Measure of Divinity. As if the newest<lb/>
Stamp were to be deemed <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> the truest<lb/>
Metal; and the last dictate of a fallacious<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="10">C</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
Understanding were the best object<lb/>
for the Wills <normalised orig="embracement" auto="true">embrace</normalised>: Then indeed<lb/>
our Saviours Argument would be nothing<lb/>
but a Sophism against <normalised orig="Pharisaical" auto="false">Pharizeeical</normalised> Devorces;<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 19.8">From the beginning <normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> not so</quote>, (Matth.<lb/>
19.8.) nor would the Advice in the Text<lb/>
be solid; <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Jn 2.24">Let that therefore abide in you<lb/>
which <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> have heard from the beginning.</quote>
                  <lb/>
But it is not every thing that pleases the<lb/>
Ear that must be closeted and lodged in<lb/>
the Heart, lest Tares being sowed amongst<lb/>
the Corn, they spread, and flourish, and<lb/>
o'er-shadow the Grain: Our Saviour therefore<lb/>
knowing our promptitude to imbibe<lb/>
what might seem pleasant, and to swallow<lb/>
<normalised orig="Poyson" auto="true">Poison</normalised> if <normalised orig="wrap'd" auto="true">wrapped</normalised> up in gilded Pills; leaves<lb/>
a grave and severe Caveat, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mk 4.24">Take heed what<lb/>
<normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> hear</quote>, (Mark. 4.24.) and lest our strict<lb/>
observation of the matter should make us<lb/>
regardless of the manner of performance;<lb/>
St. Luke delivers it, <quote type="biblical" ana="Lk 8.18">Take heed how you hear</quote>;<lb/>
(Luke 8.18.) As well knowing that too<lb/>
few look to their Feet when they approach<lb/>
the Sanctuary of the Lord, but are<lb/>
more ready to offer the Sacrifice of Fools,<lb/>
then to hear their Vices <normalised orig="redargued" auto="true">regarded</normalised> as they<lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
ought; not allowing themselves so much<lb/>
either of time, or seriousness, as to consider<lb/>
that they do evil. These are such Auditors<lb/>
as St. Austin reprehends, Audientes<lb/>
corporis sensu qui non audiunt cordis assensu;<lb/>
who use the Word and Doctrine of the<lb/>
Gospel only as an Ornament to deck the<lb/>
Head, not as a foundation to establish the<lb/>
Heart; that hang it only as a Jewel in the<lb/>
Ear, but reserve it not as a choice treasure<lb/>
to enrich the Soul; whose practice is just<lb/>
opposite to St. James's advice, they will<lb/>
not lay apart all filthiness and superfluity<lb/>
of naughtiness, that they may receive with<lb/>
meekness the engrafted Word which is able<lb/>
to save their Souls; (James 1.21.) <choice ana="print-error">

many sooner bow their Ears to what<lb/>

the frothy discourses of deceitful Tongues;<lb/>
to bold Rants, and jovial Catches; to<lb/>
those lewd Sonnets that are the loose composures<lb/>
of looser brains, which being heated<lb/>
with vice, boil over in scum and filth:<lb/>
men are more attentive to new Oaths, and<lb/>

hardy as to Lampoon Heaven, and make<lb/>
Satyrs against the Quire above; that<lb/>
would, if either method might prevail,<lb/>
Flout, or Hector, God Almighty from his<lb/>

than <normalised orig="rayling" auto="true">railing</normalised> Rabshekeh's. These, that are<lb/>
spots in our Feasts of Charity, become<lb/>
the only Persons worthy of Entertainment;<lb/>
their black Language is viewed, and<lb/>
gazed on, as the brightest Oracles; every<lb/>
shrug raises admiration, and a little smile<lb/>
is enough to authorize a great jest: as if<lb/>
these wandering Comets were of more solidity<lb/>
than the fixed Stars; and the Language<lb/>
of Hell to be more diligently attended<lb/>
than the Voice of Heaven. God<lb/>
at once pardon and remedy it. The <normalised orig="Ambassadours" auto="true">Ambassadors</normalised><lb/>
of the Most High may take up<lb/>
the Lamentation of him that first gave<lb/>
them their Commission. <quote type="biblical" ana="Jer 6.10">To whom shall<lb/>
we speak and give warning that they<lb/>
may hear? Behold their Ear is Uncircumcised,<lb/>
and they cannot hearken; Behold<lb/>

                     <lb/>
reproach; they have no delight in it.</quote>
                  <lb/>
(Jer. 6.10.)<lb/>
Some indeed are much for the Ear; attending<lb/>
to those scandals and reproaches<lb/>
that the envious man will cast upon him<lb/>
whom his malice ruins, or his ambition<lb/>
undermines: others, even in Sacred things,<lb/>
reduce devotion all to the Ear; and when<lb/>
God, principally requires the Heart in<lb/>
Prayer, these will give little else but the<lb/>
Ear in Hearing; being as partial in their<lb/>
Sacrifices towards God, as they are in their<lb/>
Censures towards their Neighbours, as if<lb/>
the Decalogue were now abolished, and<lb/>
the only Command were, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mk 12.29">Hear O Israel</quote>.<lb/>
<normalised orig="'Twas" auto="true">It was</normalised> the error of the Euchites to be always<lb/>

to be always Hearing: as if the School of<lb/>
our Saviour should not only be <normalised orig="enjoyned" auto="true">enjoined</normalised><lb/>
Biennial silence, but be for ever mute.<lb/>
Porphyry indeed, (that great Blasphemer,<lb/>
big with malice against the Heavens) when<lb/>

out something of the results of his own<lb/>
Reason, <normalised orig="teacheth" auto="true">teaches</normalised> us to Sacrifice our Souls<lb/>
to God in silence with <normalised orig="Chast" auto="true">Chaste</normalised> thoughts;<lb/>

                  <lb/>
How <normalised orig="Chast" auto="true">Chaste</normalised> men are at those seasons that<lb/>
ought to be attended with Solemnity, and<lb/>
Devotion, it would be presumption in<lb/>
any to <normalised orig="judg" auto="true">judge</normalised>: but sure I am that they put<lb/>
in practice this sage advice of their Father<lb/>
Porphyry, who thus pretend to Worship<lb/>
God in silence: As if he that made the<lb/>
Tongue as well as the Ear, did not require<lb/>
the one to make Oblations of Prayer<lb/>
and Praise, as well as the other to Hear<lb/>
his Word; or he that Created the whole<lb/>
man would be contented with a partial<lb/>
Sacrifice. And now if any one has Ears<lb/>
to hear let him hear; and not only so,<lb/>
but retain also what he has heard; so will<lb/>
the Exhortation in my Text be embraced:<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Jn 2.24">Let that therefore abide in you which <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> have<lb/>
heard from the beginning.</quote>
                  <lb/>
Having thus endeavoured to free mankind<lb/>
from such diseases and distempers in<lb/>
Religion; I must now crave leave to attempt<lb/>
the recommendation of our duty;<lb/>
and persuade men to the diligent attention<lb/>
to that Sacred Word, which is able<lb/>
to make us wise unto Salvation, and be<lb/>
greedy to receive it, when not extended<lb/>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
in an adulterated hand: For as we cannot<lb/>
hear without a Preacher, so he cannot Preach<lb/>
that is not sent, (Rom. 10.15.) Some men<lb/>
are like those large tongued women in<lb/>
Tertullians time, who though a person of<lb/>
excellent Language, was yet forced to inveigh<lb/>
against them that being so liberal<lb/>
of their Speech in Private, conjectured they<lb/>
had, if not <normalised orig="Rhetorick" auto="true">Rhetoric</normalised>, and Reason, yet<lb/>
words enough, to <normalised orig="declame" auto="true">declaim</normalised> in <normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised>;<lb/>
whom the Father reprehends in this Prohibition:<lb/>
                  Non permittitur mulieri in Ecclesia<lb/>
loqui, sed nec docere, nec tinguere; nec<lb/>
offerre; nec ullius virilis muneris, nedum<lb/>
sacerdotalis officii, fortem tibi vindicare: or<lb/>
like those that St. Austin complains of, in<lb/>
the second Chapter of his first Book of the<lb/>
Trinity, that are garruli ratiocinatores, elatiores<lb/>
quam capaciores; that are <normalised orig="pratling" auto="true">prattling</normalised><lb/>
Disputants, more shrill than rational:<lb/>
How many dismal mourning souls, whose<lb/>
Education never advanced them to any<lb/>
degree above Mechanism, steal away the<lb/>
Priests Office, as Neanthus did Orpheus's<lb/>
Harps, who thinking to effect the same<lb/>
wonders Orpheus did, and make Woods<lb/>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
and Trees dance after his melody, played<lb/>
so ill, that the very Dogs, being affrighted<lb/>
at his strange noise, tore him all in pieces.<lb/>
When we hear therefore, we must not<lb/>
throw away our attention upon usurping<lb/>
<normalised orig="Schismaticks" auto="true">Schismatics</normalised>; whose very Preaching is<lb/>
their Crime, because without a Sacred<lb/>
and Divine Commission; and since giving<lb/>
them Audience is their <normalised orig="encouragment" auto="true">encouragement</normalised>, it<lb/>
can no less involve such <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> Auditors in<lb/>
a snare and guilt.<lb/>
And yet, since the Text exhibits something<lb/>
that always has been heard, it does<lb/>
not only imply our duty of attention, but<lb/>
presents us with what we ought to hear;<lb/>
and <normalised orig="thats" auto="false">that's</normalised> the Gospel; what both the Apostles<lb/>
and Disciples were acquainted with<lb/>
from the beginning: And since, in that<lb/>
Sacred Testimony to our Saviour, there<lb/>
are various Truths which make up its Contexture;<lb/>
those things are first to be heard<lb/>
and received that are in themselves most<lb/>
Fundamental; Primarium dogma de Christi<lb/>
divinitate, (says Justinian) the chief Doctrine<lb/>
of the Divinity of our Saviour, without<lb/>
which the Foundation being sunk, the<lb/>
                  <pb n="16"/>
                  <lb/>
whole <normalised orig="fabrick" auto="true">fabric</normalised> must of necessity be demolished:<lb/>
For since his Divinity gives merit<lb/>
to his Passion, by which his temporal punishment<lb/>
bears proportion to an infinite<lb/>
offence; detract from his Deity and you<lb/>
spot his sufferings; and then if he be a<lb/>
Lamb with blemish, though he be slain, he<lb/>
cannot <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised>; and so the series of our Salvation<lb/>
becomes disordered, and our eternal<lb/>
safety undermined.<lb/>
And now perhaps some wise person<lb/>
might take advantage to <normalised orig="exhibite" auto="true">exhibit</normalised>, or adventure<lb/>
at a Catalogue of Fundamentals;<lb/>
and a clamorous Adversary might with as<lb/>
much confidence and triumph demand<lb/>
them; but when we receive a particular<lb/>
of Explicits, we may then attempt a Catalogue<lb/>
of Fundamentals. In the mean<lb/>
time, since Faith is the general condition<lb/>
of the Gospel; and, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mk 16.16">He that <normalised orig="believeth" auto="true">believes</normalised>, <lb/>
                     <choice ana="print-error">

                     </choice> is baptised, shall be saved</quote> (Mark. 16.<lb/>
16.) Methinks we need disturb our selves<lb/>
no further for Fundamentals, than to define<lb/>
what <normalised orig="compleats" auto="true">completes</normalised> that one thing, Faith.<lb/>
And though Interest and Opinion have<lb/>
rendered it as different from it self as one<lb/>

                  <lb/>
mans fancy from another, and we have<lb/>
created almost as many varieties of Faith,<lb/>
not only as there are Nations in the world,<lb/>
but men too; (multitudes dealing by it as<lb/>
Caligula did by the Image of Jupiter Olympiacus<lb/>
when he took from it its head of<lb/>
Gold, and put upon it an head of Brass;)<lb/>
yet if we will admit the Father of the<lb/>
Faithful: to explain the difficulty, we<lb/>
shall find that the practice of the Patriarch<lb/>
Abraham, (who is exhibited as a pattern<lb/>
for Gospel believers;) will give us a<lb/>
prospect of that Faith which had its being<lb/>
from the beginning. And though there<lb/>
are many acts of this ancient Faith presented<lb/>
to our perusal in New Testament<lb/>
Pages, yet there are two comprehensive<lb/>
of all the rest, to wit Belief and Obedience.<lb/>
For when he to whom all things<lb/>
are possible, had promised a branch should<lb/>
sprout forth from this dry Root; and<lb/>
that he would be his shield, and great reward<lb/>
(Gen. 15.1.) Abraham did not question<lb/>
the word of a Deity, who, he knew,<lb/>
was able to <normalised orig="controul" auto="true">control</normalised> the world, and alter<lb/>
the power of second Causes according to<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="19">18</fw>
                  <pb n="18"/>
                  <lb/>
the pleasure of his own will: but <normalised orig="stedfastly" auto="true">steadfastly</normalised><lb/>
assented to the truth of what God had promised;<lb/>
relying on it with Faith and Expectation.<lb/>
And as this Action includes belief<lb/>
of the Promises, so the second prescribes<lb/>
obedience to the Commands; and<lb/>
it was that work which St. James says justified<lb/>
him, even the offering up his Son<lb/>
Isaac upon the Altar (Jam. 2.21.) So that<lb/>
to <normalised orig="sum" auto="true">some</normalised> up the whole Gospel in one word,<lb/>
that you may here have presented in an<lb/>
Epitome, what I humbly beg may abide<lb/>
in you: He that believes the Promises, so<lb/>
as to obey the Precepts; that accepts his<lb/>
Saviour as a King to rule, and a Prophet<lb/>
to teach, as well as a Priest to make <normalised orig="attonement" auto="true">atonement</normalised>;<lb/>
and, consequently, submits to<lb/>
the authority of his Laws, and to the conduct<lb/>
of his Ministry and Discipline; that<lb/>
relies upon the merits of his Cross, and<lb/>
<normalised orig="persues" auto="true">pursues</normalised> the steps of his <normalised orig="vertuous" auto="true">virtuous</normalised> Life, in<lb/>
order to the securing his eternal Safety:<lb/>
He is the Person who retains what he has<lb/>
already heard; and he need not fear any<lb/>
<normalised orig="deceiptfull" auto="true">deceitful</normalised> Imposition, since he embraces<lb/>
that which was from the beginning. Which<lb/>

                  <fw type="pageNum" n="20">D 2</fw>
                  <pb n="19"/>
                  <lb/>
minds me of the Motive here proposed, to<lb/>
<normalised orig="fortifie" auto="true">fortify</normalised> our resolutions, that what we have<lb/>
heard may abide in us, since it is no more<lb/>
than what was delivered from the beginning.<lb/>
In Philosophical Propositions we usually<lb/>
deem those most certain that later experiments<lb/>
prove, and evince: but, in Divine<lb/>
Truths, those are best that were from the<lb/>
beginning. Time, which is in a continued<lb/>
flux, being in this like the swiftest Torrents,<lb/>
that carry down to us what is light<lb/>
and frothy; but sink that which is grave<lb/>
and ponderous: and indeed Reason, which<lb/>
is the result of our nobler part, if not<lb/>
disturbed by passion or interest, is the<lb/>
surest guide in the midst of perplexities;<lb/>
and this does, upon the first prospect of<lb/>
Religion, lead us to that which was from<lb/>
the beginning. And Christianity being that<lb/>
which pretends to be first begotten in Heaven,<lb/>
though brought forth here on Earth,<lb/>
owning not less than a God for its Author,<lb/>
whose great propositions are made up of<lb/>
Eternal Truths; and since the Apostles<lb/>
were inspired to a <normalised orig="compleat" auto="true">complete</normalised> delivery of<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="21">20</fw>
                  <pb n="20"/>
                  <lb/>
what was at first Preached by our Saviour,<lb/>
the same Doctrine, by a continued<lb/>
succession, having been derived and conveyed<lb/>
to Posterity; it follows, by an inevitable<lb/>
conclusion, that the surest way, for<lb/>
us, to whom these Principles are exhibited,<lb/>
when any Objection, or different Opinion,<lb/>
presents it self, to startle our apprehensions;<lb/>
is to <normalised orig="persue" auto="true">pursue</normalised> the first Rule, and<lb/>
follow that which was delivered from the<lb/>
beginning.<lb/>
But since the various subdivisions of<lb/>
those that <normalised orig="intitle" auto="true">entitle</normalised> themselves to the names<lb/>
of Christians, pretend to those infallible<lb/>
Maxims treasured up in the Sacred Book;<lb/>
there must be left a <normalised orig="Judg" auto="true">Judge</normalised> of Controversies;<lb/>
or else there will remain no way of<lb/>
freedom from present disturbances, or<lb/>
certain method of reducing those who,<lb/>
being too fond of their own fancies, resolutely<lb/>
adhere to their private Opinions,<lb/>
to the detriment of Christianity, and ruin<lb/>
of themselves, and the obstruction of<lb/>
Peace and Unity in the world. The Doctrine<lb/>
of the Gospel, although certain in<lb/>
it self, being conveyed to us in Words<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="22">21</fw>
                  <pb n="21"/>
                  <lb/>
and Language which may admit of different<lb/>
Constructions, suitable either to the<lb/>
use of words, or the apprehensions of men,<lb/>
cannot, (without such a judgment upon it<lb/>
as may oblige the various extravagancies<lb/>
of mankind to silence, and a passive submission,<lb/>
whatever may be their internal<lb/>
belief;) be sufficient Clue to lead us out of<lb/>
these Labyrinths: Though had the multitude<lb/>
of its Followers justly measured and<lb/>
proportioned Understandings, rightly to<lb/>
discern the Fruits wrapped in those Leaves,<lb/>
it must appear to every man, the best, and<lb/>
only Conductor in the world. But, because<lb/>
every person usurps Authority to<lb/>
interpret, and every Illiterate and Enthusiastical<lb/>
head, if he has not reason to confirm<lb/>
his Gloss, has confidence however to pretend<lb/>
an Inspiration; necessity <normalised orig="inforces" auto="true">enforces</normalised> us<lb/>
to seek some method to quiet our minds,<lb/>
and to allay the briskness of our own fancies,<lb/>
and those heats and fury, that our<lb/>
warmer contrivances introduce into the<lb/>
world: that so we may arrive at such certainty<lb/>
as is possible to be obtained, of what<lb/>
was heard from the beginning.<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="23">22</fw>
                  <pb n="22"/>
                  <lb/>
And though I shall not attempt the leading<lb/>
any to St. Peters Chair, nor beg that<lb/>
Rome may be the place of Umpire; because<lb/>
there is no need of fetching water<lb/>
from Tiber when we have clear Fountains<lb/>
at our own doors: yet reason must force<lb/>
this confession, that since it is not the letter,<lb/>
but the <normalised orig="sence" auto="true">sense</normalised>, of Scripture that is the<lb/>
proper Guide of life; there must be allowed<lb/>
some Interpretation, since our demands<lb/>
to one another may be the same<lb/>
with the Eunuch to St. Philip, how shall<lb/>
we Read without some Interpreter? And<lb/>
then the last question will be who are those<lb/>
that are most likely to exhibit to us the<lb/>
exact design of Scripture Phrase, and the<lb/>
infallible Rule that leads to Life? <lb/>
To produce therefore some conclusions<lb/>
touching this controverted, and difficult,<lb/>
Question; Those must certainly best inform<lb/>
one of the meaning of a Sermon, that<lb/>
have had the most familiar acquaintance<lb/>
with the Preacher; Capacities also to apprehend,<lb/>
and Fidelity to deliver what they<lb/>
have received from the mouth of the Orator:<lb/>
upon which proposition those persons,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="24">23</fw>
                  <pb n="23"/>
                  <lb/>
that seem most rational, attempt the<lb/>
proof of the Apostles Writings that are but<lb/>
the first Commentaries upon that Gospel<lb/>
which our Saviour Preached and Ushered<lb/>
into the World. From hence (secondly)<lb/>
it follows that the persons who were the<lb/>
immediate Disciples to those Holy Penmen<lb/>
of Sacred Writ, having the advantages of<lb/>
Converse, and the benefit of Audience,<lb/>
must of necessity be the fittest Judges of<lb/>
what is Controverted in matter of our Religion,<lb/>
which we pretend to derive from<lb/>
their Books and Writings: and there seems<lb/>
to remain nothing to be doubted, but either<lb/>
their Capacities to receive, or their<lb/>
Faithfulness to deliver, what they heard<lb/>
from the beginning. Their Capacities and<lb/>
Parts their Writings publish; their Integrity<lb/>
and Honesty their Lives declared; neither<lb/>
had they either reason, or advantage<lb/>
thus to cheat, or impose upon, the world.<lb/>
And therefore those Writers, who lived in<lb/>
the first Ages of Christianity, are first to<lb/>
be believed; that in difficulties and straits<lb/>
we are to have recourse unto; and consequently<lb/>
the later to be less confided in,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="25">24</fw>
                  <pb n="24"/>
                  <lb/>
as having met with greater and more <normalised orig="subtile" auto="true">subtle</normalised><lb/>
opposition, and therefore subject to<lb/>
more intermixtures of heat and passion; and<lb/>
like Rivers, the further off the Fountain,<lb/>
the less do they retain of their first purity,<lb/>
and the greater mingling of different waters.<lb/>
As the nearer we are to the Fountain<lb/>
therefore, the clearer will the Stream be;<lb/>
so the nearer we Travel to that which was<lb/>
heard from the beginning, the more certain<lb/>
and infallible will our Guide and Rule<lb/>
be. But because the reports and sayings<lb/>
of Fathers are like melted Wax that receives<lb/>
the Image suitable to the Seal which<lb/>
makes the impression; and persons of divers<lb/>
Churches, and Persuasions, deal with<lb/>
their Sentences, as young Sophisters with<lb/>
a Text of Aristotle, by a distinction, or a<lb/>
figure, force them to countenance the various<lb/>
Sentiments of their disturbed minds:<lb/>
If we rest here, we shall still be as far from<lb/>
the end of <normalised orig="Controversie" auto="true">Controversy</normalised>, as the <normalised orig="Controversie" auto="true">Controversy</normalised><lb/>
from the beginning of Truth. To<lb/>
proceed further then, by the assistance of<lb/>
those means our Reason dictates, together<lb/>
with prayers and humility of mind, to<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="26">E</fw>
                  <pb n="25"/>
                  <lb/>
the investigation of what we are to rest in,<lb/>
as that which was from the beginning.<lb/>
A General Council would quickly determine<lb/>
it, did not an Empire now Cantonized;<lb/>
the opposite Interest of Princes<lb/>
among themselves; diversity of Factions<lb/>
sprung up among their Subjects;<lb/>
the great Prejudices that are in the world;<lb/>
and above all, over grown Popery, clearly<lb/>
obstruct its Justice and Freedom; and<lb/>
I might say, its Possibility too. As every<lb/>
Episcopal Church, therefore, was Planted,<lb/>
at the first, Independent of another; yet,<lb/>
to preserve a Church Catholic upon Earth,<lb/>
admitting an Universal Union, Correspondence,<lb/>
Advice; and, by consent, an Obligation<lb/>
upon particulars, by Authority<lb/>
from the whole. Every particular Episcopal<lb/>
Church had a power of Discipline as<lb/>
well as Doctrine, committed to her trust<lb/>
and managery; the first Planters conveying<lb/>
downward, through a Sacred and <normalised orig="uninterupted" auto="false">uninterrupted</normalised><lb/>
Succession, their Authority<lb/>
and Jurisdiction to this Age, and this<lb/>
Church, to which we now pretend a Relation.<lb/>
In <normalised orig="Controversie" auto="true">Controversy</normalised> and difference (as<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="27">26</fw>
                  <pb n="26"/>
                  <lb/>
the Case now stands with us) there can be<lb/>
no Example, or Rule, or more Rational Pattern,<lb/>
or Guide of Action, than that of the<lb/>
Primitive Planters of the Gospel; which<lb/>
is, that the Inferior be regulated by the<lb/>
Advice and Authority of the Superior, and<lb/>
all submit to the reasonable resolution of<lb/>
a National Council. Thus when the great<lb/>
dispute about Circumcision was raised at<lb/>
Antioch, the Metropolis of Syria, they Appealed<lb/>
to Jerusalem, to which Antioch was<lb/>
subjected, being a place of Superior Jurisdiction;<lb/>
and the determination of the Bishops<lb/>
of Judea, with Paul and Barnabas,<lb/>
Representatives of Antioch, fully silenced<lb/>
any farther Dispute, and was the infallible<lb/>
sentence in which they acquiesced.<lb/>
Acts 15.<lb/>
But now, let not any men wonder that<lb/>
I call the Sentences of such Councils Infallible;<lb/>
since <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> only using a Popish word,<lb/>
to express Protestant <normalised orig="sence" auto="true">sense</normalised>, to our selves,<lb/>
which overthrows the Roman claims over<lb/>
us. For this being applied to our Councils<lb/>
here; our Church neither erring in<lb/>
Fundamentals, nor pretending to usurp<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="28">E 2</fw>

                  <lb/>
upon the Natural <normalised orig="Priviledg" auto="true">Privilege</normalised> of mankind<lb/>
to judge for themselves as far as they are<lb/>
capable; but only assists and helps their<lb/>
Understanding in what they are deficient<lb/>
for want of Education; creating no New<lb/>
Articles of Faith: nay imposing nothing<lb/>
on the belief of any, but what the Scriptures<lb/>
have Authorized before; and Ordaining<lb/>
nothing by its own power, but a<lb/>
limitation of the outward actions of<lb/>
men: its decrees in things that are thus the<lb/>
subject of human Laws, are either to be<lb/>
actually obeyed, or not <normalised orig="publickly" auto="true">publicly</normalised> or tumultuosly<lb/>
contradicted. And this is what<lb/>
I intend to be the <normalised orig="sence" auto="true">sense</normalised> of the Infallible<lb/>
Sentence of a National Council, without<lb/>
which, <normalised orig="Controversie" auto="true">Controversy</normalised> can never be ended,<lb/>
no Legislative Authority maintained, nor<lb/>
Peace and Order remain among us. For<lb/>
want of this moderate and sober apprehension<lb/>
of things, men make themselves <normalised orig="lyable" auto="true">liable</normalised><lb/>
to those Penalties of Laws which<lb/>
good natured Magistrates so unwillingly<lb/>
inflict, and well meaning Christians pity,<lb/>
and at the same time admire the Confidence<lb/>

                  <lb/>
willing to deserve them; especially when<lb/>
they consider, also, that the same persons<lb/>
can be tamely silent, in Forain Countries<lb/>
where Principles of Religion more<lb/>
severely contradict the Sentiments of their<lb/>
minds.<lb/>
<normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> true, indeed, a Council may err,<lb/>
unless they could put off their manhood,<lb/>
or to every decree have a fresh Inspiration,<lb/>
or receive a Divine Testimony from Heaven;<lb/>
and yet it is to us Infallible; (i.e.)<lb/>
to silence our open Disputes against it, and<lb/>
to be the Rule for our External Obedience.<lb/>
For frail men cannot possibly proceed farther<lb/>
in the searching out Divine Truths,<lb/>
than in the means, and way to find out the<lb/>
Revelation; and to understand it when it<lb/>
is found; leaving other indifferent things to<lb/>
the determination of those who have Authority<lb/>
over us: and those means that I have<lb/>
mentioned seeming to be all that Reason<lb/>
and Discourse, when not <normalised orig="disturb'd" auto="true">disturbed</normalised> by Lunacy<lb/>
or Enthusiasm, are able to propose;<lb/>
and since the only Evidence we have to<lb/>
prove the objects of sense against the bold<lb/>
denial of a confident <normalised orig="Sceptick" auto="true">Sceptic</normalised>, is to call<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="30">29</fw>

                  <lb/>
in many, against the obstinacy of one, to<lb/>
give Testimony to what we see, or hear;<lb/>
and so to decide the difference betwixt us:<lb/>
If I err with submission to that Authority<lb/>
which I find the ultimate mean to determine,<lb/>
my Crime, certainly, will not be so<lb/>
great, but a pardon will as necessarily attend<lb/>
it; since the most gracious God does<lb/>
not require my action to be beyond the<lb/>
Sphere of my capacity; nor my apprehensions<lb/>
to exceed the Powers of my being.<lb/>
But the Authority of Councils, as<lb/>
hitherto stated, may seem too naked to be<lb/>
submitted to; and yet we observed in the<lb/>
first times, a ready obedience to their decrees,<lb/>
when backed by no Secular Power:<lb/>
If therefore they were obliging then, they<lb/>
engage us by another addition, and are<lb/>
strengthened by a Civil Sanction. For as,<lb/>
when the Emperors became Christians;<lb/>
what was before Established by our Saviour<lb/>
and his Apostles, and asserted by Pious<lb/>
Bishops, and Divines Congregated for<lb/>
that purpose, and drawn into Sacred Canons,<lb/>

                  <lb/>
and were so <normalised orig="embodyed" auto="false">embodied</normalised> with Imperial Laws,<lb/>
that the Magistrate was Custos utriusque<lb/>
Tabulæ: so the Protestant Church, among<lb/>
our selves, has its Foundations, in the<lb/>
Word of God, (derived downward from<lb/>
prime Antiquity) so inlaid with the Temporal<lb/>
Laws of our own Kingdom, that the<lb/>
one cannot be invaded with Triumph, but<lb/>
the other nods; nay totters, till it falls into<lb/>
inevitable <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised>; and we need not a new<lb/>
Experiment to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> it. This every one,<lb/>
at length, believes, that is not, by being<lb/>
engaged in past mischiefs, an enemy to<lb/>
both, and like Cataline, resolved on future<lb/>
evils to <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised>, or secure, those that<lb/>
are past. But they, more distinctly, are<lb/>
acquainted with this, who are Learned in<lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*he</sic>
                     <corr>the</corr>
                  </choice> Laws, than we, who being Divines,<lb/>
are willingly supposed ignorant of them.<lb/>
Yet this seems to be the great Reason why<lb/>
such as design to invade the Crown, make<lb/>
a pass at the <normalised orig="Miter" auto="true">Mitre</normalised> first, because the<lb/>
Church is a Guard to the Palace, as<lb/>
well as the Palace a defence to the<lb/>
Church. Till this therefore be wounded,<lb/>
or removed, the disturbers of the Peace<lb/>
                  <pb n="31"/>
                  <lb/>
of both, cannot, in probability, ascend<lb/>
the Throne, nor place a Duke of Venice<lb/>
there.<lb/>
But, to return from this digression; a<lb/>
National Council ought more especially to<lb/>
determine the Controversies among us, so<lb/>
as to oblige us to Peace, because their Decrees<lb/>
are our own Acts, having chosen the<lb/>
persons who represent us in it. Yet to silence<lb/>
doubts, and scruples, about this<lb/>
matter: whatever regard we may all have<lb/>
to tender Consciences, that are not raw;<lb/>
the different thoughts of Worship among<lb/>
us, being such as produce squabble and<lb/>
contentions, these, for our necessary ease<lb/>
and pleasure, dividing us into separated<lb/>
Clans; and these making us fit for Conspiracy,<lb/>
which, without any more Devils<lb/>
than our selves, may advance it self<lb/>
into an actual Rebellion: And when various,<lb/>
and severe Contests about Religion<lb/>
have openly distinguished men from each<lb/>
other, till they are hardly able to know<lb/>
themselves; when private Dispensations,<lb/>
shall, in some cases, vacat <normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised> Oaths<lb/>
by single Interpretations, and in Equivocations,<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="33">32</fw>
                  <pb n="32"/>
                  <lb/>
and Mental Reservations men are<lb/>
able to out-strip the Jesuit himself; this is<lb/>
a way to remove the Pope, only by bringing<lb/>
him into our own Bellies, and instead<lb/>
of a Union of Protestants among<lb/>
our selves, is the direct way to introduce<lb/>
Popery in Masquerade (that I may use<lb/>
some Rhetorical words) and to <normalised orig="imbrace" auto="true">embrace</normalised><lb/>
what we <normalised orig="declame" auto="true">declaim</normalised> against, and every Protestant<lb/>
is bound in his own capacity, to<lb/>
withstand. But when Trade and Occupations<lb/>
determine our Option, and past Acts<lb/>
(though evil in themselves) must regulate<lb/>
our present, and future, deportment:<lb/>
when persons <normalised orig="chuse" auto="true">choose</normalised> their Articles of Creed,<lb/>
as well as various ways of Worship, suitable<lb/>
to what they gain from those with<lb/>
whom they seem Religiously to associate:<lb/>
Conscience and Christianity do no<lb/>
longer guide them, but they give away<lb/>
their choice to Clients, Trade, and (amongst<lb/>
Divines) to the preferments of<lb/>
this World; and, all this while, <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> Earth<lb/>
becomes their Supreme God, and Secular<lb/>
Interest governs their Religion. When<lb/>
Affairs therefore, through our own indiscretion,<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="34">F</fw>
                  <pb n="33"/>
                  <lb/>
or the wickedness of others, are<lb/>
brought to this pass, that men will violate<lb/>
their Oaths to preserve Religion, or<lb/>
neglect Prayers to serve God; or attend<lb/>
Prayers to serve the Devil, and when, by<lb/>
such methods as these, the Prologue is<lb/>
made to the dismal Tragedy of a general<lb/>
Confusion, <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> time to call for a solemn<lb/>
Consultation and for a Christian Magistrate<lb/>
to interpose by Law, least the Disorders<lb/>
in what we call by the Ancient and Venerable<lb/>
name of Religion, may have too severe<lb/>
an influence on the State, and both<lb/>
be ruined by the same hands; since these<lb/>
are like Hypocrates Twins, that weep and<lb/>
laugh both together. <normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> time therefore<lb/>
(at such a Season) to call upon our sleeping<lb/>
Laws to awake, whose Penalties have<lb/>
an equal Sanction with themselves: and<lb/>
more especially, because punishment of<lb/>
Extravagant <normalised orig="Offendors" auto="true">Offenders</normalised> can be no Persecution,<lb/>
when the Christian Religion is<lb/>
not concerned, but the various Interests<lb/>
of this World; and Penalties (in this<lb/>
Case) will only restrain the inordinate<lb/>
Affection of some men to their private<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="35">34</fw>
                  <pb n="34"/>
                  <lb/>
Concerns in relation to their abode here;<lb/>
and teach them how to be Crucified<lb/>
to this World, that they may more<lb/>
easily ascend into Glory in the next.<lb/>
<normalised orig="'Twill" auto="true">It will</normalised> keep them steady whilst they walk<lb/>
upon the Earth, when the Wings of their<lb/>
Ambition are <normalised orig="clyp'd" auto="false">clipped</normalised> and <normalised orig="pois'd" auto="true">poised</normalised>; and cause<lb/>
them to grow better, by Religion,<lb/>
and Loyalty; that by a peaceable departure<lb/>
out of this Life they may enter<lb/>
into the Joy of our Lord. This (though,<lb/>
to some, it may seem severe) can be no<lb/>
violence offered to Conscience, where we<lb/>
plainly see there is none at all. <normalised orig="'Twill" auto="true">It will</normalised> be<lb/>
at most, no more than a limitation of<lb/>
Trade and Covetousness, by restraining<lb/>
the Contentions and Ambition of mankind.<lb/>
And now, if upon all this Discourse,<lb/>
a carping Protestant, or angry Romanist,<lb/>
should blunder upon this Objection;<lb/>
that if the Church be infallible, quoad nos;<lb/>
so it was at the time of our withdrawing<lb/>
from the Roman Communion, and therefore<lb/>
we then breaking the Principal Bond<lb/>
of Truth and Union, must remain guilty of<lb/>
the greatest Shism, unless we return to that<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="36">F 2</fw>
                  <pb n="35"/>
                  <lb/>
Church from whence we have departed. It<lb/>
is, without any difficulty, replied, that he<lb/>
supposes that granted which we will not<lb/>
yield; for we were never lawfully subject<lb/>
to the Roman Church, in respect of Spirituals,<lb/>
any more than we were to the late<lb/>
Monster of <normalised orig="Traytors" auto="true">Traitors</normalised>, in respect of Temporals:<lb/>
a prosperous Usurpation giving<lb/>
them no better Title over our Church,<lb/>
which was distinct at its first reception of<lb/>
Christianity, than the others possession<lb/>
gave him right to his Sovereigns Throne;<lb/>
both being effected, by <normalised orig="Subtilty" auto="true">Subtlety</normalised>, Force, and<lb/>
Usurpation.<lb/>
Thus having, through this Discourse, exhibited<lb/>
a great Character of Truth, which<lb/>
is prime Antiquity; and given some slender<lb/>
account of what has been heard from<lb/>
the beginning: All that remains is to <normalised orig="inforce" auto="true">enforce</normalised><lb/>
the Apostles Exhortation to the duty,<lb/>
and beg that ancient Truths may abide<lb/>
in you. We have now had the <normalised orig="Tryal" auto="true">Trial</normalised><lb/>
of all things, let us therefore hold fast that<lb/>
which is good: we have been too long<lb/>
tossed in a storm, but having at last, arrived<lb/>
at a safe Harbour, let us no more sail<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="37">36</fw>
                  <pb n="36"/>
                  <lb/>
out among the Rocks, nor put to Sea whilst<lb/>
the Winds rage, and the Waves roar. The<lb/>
True, Ancient, and <normalised orig="Apostolick" auto="true">Apostolic</normalised> Faith was,<lb/>
for some time, like the lost sheep; it <normalised orig="wandred" auto="true">wandered</normalised><lb/>
about in a Wilderness of Error, and the<lb/>
by Paths of <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised> and Schism, being torn<lb/>
and scratched with Briars and Thorns, not<lb/>
only till it was <normalised orig="smeered" auto="true">smeared</normalised> with blood, but at<lb/>
last it became Naked Truth: Naked, indeed;<lb/>
for being void of <normalised orig="Hypocrisie" auto="true">Hypocrisy</normalised>, it became<lb/>
Naked of Friends too: But now, since we<lb/>
have found the lost sheep no wonder that I<lb/>
Exhort you, as he did his Friends in the<lb/>
Gospel; <quote type="biblical" ana="Lk 15.9"><normalised orig="Rejoyce" auto="true">Rejoice</normalised> with me for I have found the<lb/>
sheep that was lost</quote>. And since the search<lb/>
has been no less tedious, than in these times,<lb/>
full of hazard; let us no longer shift the<lb/>
Principles of our Religion, nor permit the<lb/>
wry Face of a man to draw our Souls and<lb/>
Bodies <normalised orig="asside" auto="false">aside</normalised>; but let those Truths abide in<lb/>
us which we have heard from the <normalised orig="begining" auto="true">beginning</normalised>.<lb/>
Why should I use any <normalised orig="Rhetorick" auto="true">Rhetoric</normalised> to persuade,<lb/>
when there is the Authority of God<lb/>
to command? Tacitus informs us of Cæsar's<lb/>
Soldiers; Imperium potius quam concilium<lb/>
sequebantur; A word of Command was<lb/>
                  <pb n="37"/>
                  <lb/>
more to them than persuasion or advice in<lb/>
a formal Speech. And shall we that march<lb/>
under our Saviours Banner be more disobedient<lb/>
than a Heathen Militia? Why<lb/>
should we not for Edification submit to<lb/>
true Decency and Order, that we may no<lb/>
longer be like Samaritans and Jews, refuse<lb/>
kinder Correspondences with each<lb/>
other? As the Apostle therefore Exhorts<lb/>
those Jews, who, though dispersed, were united<lb/>
in Christian Faith and Discipline: so<lb/>
let me, with all Charity and Affection beg,<lb/>
that you would hold fast your Profession<lb/>
(Heb. 4.14.) Can we reasonably part with<lb/>
the Glorious Gospel which promises<lb/>
Crowns and everlasting Rewards; that<lb/>
takes care of us after we are Dead, and<lb/>
leaves us neither in Purgatory or the<lb/>
Grave; nay, that free us from the Torments<lb/>
of Hell, and advances us to the Joys<lb/>
of Heaven: We cannot once depart from<lb/>
our Religion, but at the same time we abandon<lb/>
our selves, exchange our Reason<lb/>
for Folly and Madness, and barter our<lb/>
precious Souls for trifles; and what proportion<lb/>
in this exchange? <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 16.26">What is a man<lb/>
                     <pb n="38"/>
                     <lb/>
profited</quote> (says our Saviour) nay, how is a man<lb/>
utterly <normalised orig="undon" auto="true">undone</normalised> if, to gain the whole world, he<lb/>
loses his own soul? (Matth. 16.26.) Understand<lb/>
what you are capable of apprehending,<lb/>
and when you have found a Doctrine<lb/>
to be sound, take St. <normalised orig="Pauls" auto="true">Paul's</normalised> advice to<lb/>
Timothy; <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Tim 1.13">Hold fast the form of sound words</quote>, <lb/>
(<choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>1</sic>
                     <corr>2</corr>
                  </choice> Tim. 1.13.) Many of our fierce and<lb/>
staring Seperatists, like their Ancestors of<lb/>
another denomination (the Papists I mean)<lb/>
embrace Principles and Ways of Worship,<lb/>
though they understand them not.<lb/>
As Quintilian speaking of the Toscan Rights<lb/>
and the Soothsayings of the Salian Priests,<lb/>
                  Vix Sacerdotibus suis intellecta, sed quæ mutari<lb/>
vetat Religio. Scarce apprehended by<lb/>
their Priests themselves, but yet their Principles<lb/>
and Religion forbid a change. But<lb/>
that Gospel which has been heard from the<lb/>
beginning, is no Airy Doctrine to be condensed<lb/>
into a Cloud; nor so hot, as to be<lb/>
raised into a Pillar of Fire: we are not to<lb/>
be conducted as the Israelites were of old;<lb/>
nor, thanks be to God, and a Christian<lb/>
Government, is the Church yet in a Wilderness<lb/>
condition; our Principles are as<lb/>
                  <pb n="39"/>
                  <lb/>
Plain as Honest; and our Religion as Intelligible,<lb/>
as it is Rational; and the Doctrine<lb/>
and Discipline, if our Practice Corresponds,<lb/>
which the Church of England<lb/>
pretends a reverence for; by Gods blessing,<lb/>
being submitted to with meekness,<lb/>
will be sufficient to save our Souls, through<lb/>
him who first published it to the World,<lb/>
and died to make satisfaction for our sins.<lb/>
Let this therefore abide in you; that you<lb/>
may not be, like Waves of the Sea, always<lb/>
rolling, and driven which way a<lb/>
Storm pleases; but <normalised orig="setled" auto="true">settled</normalised>, and immovable,<lb/>
always abounding in the Work of the<lb/>
Lord; which let God Cooperate and<lb/>
strengthen you in, for Christ Jesus's sake;<lb/>
To whom with the Father and his Eternal Spirit,<lb/>
be all Glory, and Honour, now, and<lb/>
for ever. Amen.<lb/>
