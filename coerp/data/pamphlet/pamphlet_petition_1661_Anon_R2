KINGS <lb/>
Most Excellent <lb/>
MAJESTY.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
May it please Your Majesty, <lb/>
WHen the distempered Nation wearied with <lb/>
its own Contentions and Divisions, did groan <lb/>
for Unity and Peace, and wounderful Providence <lb/>
of the most Righteous God appearing <lb/>
for the removal of Impediments; their eyes <lb/>
were upon your Majesty, as the person born to be under God <lb/>
the Center of their Concord, and taught by Afflictions to break <lb/>
the bonds of the Afflicted, and by experience of the sad effects <lb/>
of <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>men*</sic>
                     <corr><normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised></corr>

                     <corr>uncharitableness</corr>
                  </choice>, and passions, to restrain all from violence <lb/>
and extremity, and kept up moderation and mediocrity, <lb/>
the Oil of Charity and Peace, and when your subjects desires <lb/>
were accomplished in your Majesties peaceable possession of <lb/>
the Throne, it was the joy and encouragement of the Sober and <lb/>
Religious, that you began the exercise of your Government, <lb/>
with a Proclamation full of Christian Zeal against Debauchery <lb/>
and <normalised orig="Prophaneness" auto="true">Profaneness</normalised>, declaring also your dislike of [those <lb/>
who under pretence of Affection to your Majesty, and your <lb/>
Service, assume to themselves the liberty of reviling, <normalised orig="threatning" auto="true">threatening</normalised>, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(2)">A2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
and reproaching others, to prevent the Reconciliation <lb/>
and Union of hearts and affections, which can only (with <lb/>
Gods blessing) make us <normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised> in each other] Our comforts <lb/>
also were carried on by your Majesties early, and ready entertainment <lb/>
of Motions for accommodation in those points of <lb/>
Discipline and Worship, in which wee disagreed, and your <lb/>
professed Resolutions to draw us together by mutual approaches, <lb/>
and publishing your healing Declaration, which <lb/>
was received with thanks of your House of Commons, and <lb/>
the applause of the people, and the special joy of those that <lb/>
longed for Concord and Tranquillity in the Church; in which <lb/>
your Majesty declared so much satisfaction in the foundations <lb/>
of Agreement already laid for that you [should think your self <lb/>
very unfortunate, and suspect / that you are defective in <lb/>
the Administration of Government; If any superstructures <lb/>
should slack those foundations, and contract or lessen the blessed <lb/>
gift of Charity, which is a vital part of Christian Religion. <lb/>
And as in the said gracious Declaration your Majesty resolved <lb/>
to [appoint an equal number of Learned Divines of both <lb/>
<normalised orig="Perswasions" auto="true">Persuasions</normalised>, to review the Liturgy, and make such Alterations <lb/>
as shall be thought most necessary, and some Additional <lb/>
Forms of Scripture phrase, as <normalised orig="neer" auto="true">near</normalised> as may be, suited unto the <lb/>
nature of several parts of Worship, and that it be left to the <lb/>
Ministers choice to use one, or other, at his discretion, so in <lb/>
accomplishment thereof your Majesty among others, directed <lb/>
your Commission to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> for the review of [the several Directions, <lb/>
Rules, and Forms of Prayer, and things in the said <lb/>
Book of Common-Prayer contained] And if occasion be to <lb/>
make such seasonable and necessary Alterations, Corrections, <lb/>
and Amendments thereof, as by and between us shall <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> agreed <lb/>
upon to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> needful, or expedient for the giving a satisfaction <lb/>
to tender consciences, and restoring and continuance <lb/>
of Peace and Unity in the Church under your Protection and <lb/>
Government; and what wee agree upon as needful or expedient <lb/>
to be done for the Altering, Diminishing, or Enlarging <lb/>
the said Book of Common-Prayer, forthwith to <normalised orig="certifie" auto="true">certify</normalised> and <lb/>
present it in writing to your Majesty. <lb/>
In obedience to this your Majesties Commission, wee did <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(3)">(2)</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
with the Right Reverend Bishops, who required of us that <lb/>
before any personal debate, wee should bring in writing all <lb/>
our Exceptions against the Book of Common-Prayer, and all <lb/>
the Additional Forms which wee desired; Both which wee <lb/>
performed, and received from them an Answer to the first, <lb/>
and returned them our full Reply; The last week of our time <lb/>
being designed to personal conference, was at the will of the <lb/>
Right Reverend Bishops spent in a particular dispute with <lb/>
three of each part, about the sinfulness of one of the Injunctions, <lb/>
from which wee desired to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> free, and in some other <lb/>
Conference on the <normalised orig="Bye" auto="true">Be</normalised>. And though the Account which wee<lb/>
are forced to give to your Majesty of the issue of our Consultations, <lb/>
is, that no Agreements are subscribed by us to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> offered <lb/>
to your Majesty according to your expectation; and <lb/>
though it <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> none of our intent to cast the least unmeet reflection <lb/>
upon the Right Reverend Bishops, and Learned Brethren,<lb/>
who think not meet to <normalised orig="yeeld" auto="true">yield</normalised> to any considerable Alterations, <lb/>
to the ends expressed in your Majesties Commission, yet <lb/>
wee must say, that it is some quiet to our minds, that we have <lb/>
not been guilty of your Majesties, and your Subjects disappointments, <lb/>
and that wee account not your Majesties Gracious <lb/>
Commission, and our labour lost, having peace of conscience<lb/>
in the discharge of our duty to God and you, that we have <lb/>
been the seekers and followers of Peace, and have earnestly <lb/>
Pleaded, and humbly Petitioned for it. And wee humbly <lb/>
beseech your Majesty, to <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> that wee own no Principles <lb/>
of Faction or Disobedience, nor Patronize the <normalised orig="Errours" auto="true">Errors</normalised> or <lb/>
Obstinacy, if any. <lb/>
It’s granted us by all, that nothing should <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> commanded <lb/>
us by man, which is contrary to the Word of God; that <lb/>
if it <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised>, and wee know it, wee are bound not to perform it, <lb/>
God being the absolute universal <normalised orig="Soveraign" auto="true">Sovereign</normalised>; That wee must <lb/>
use all just means to discern the will of God, and whether <lb/>
the commands of men be contrary to it; that if the command <lb/>
<normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> <normalised orig="sinfull" auto="true">sinful</normalised>, and any through the neglect of sufficient search, <lb/>
shall judge it lawful; his culpable <normalised orig="errour" auto="true">error</normalised> <normalised orig="excuseth" auto="true">excuses</normalised> not his doing <lb/>
it, from being sin; and therefore as a reasonable creature <lb/>
must needs have a judgement of discerning, that he may <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(4)">A3</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
rationally obey it; so is <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> with the greatest care and diligence <lb/>
to exercise it in the greatest things, even in the obeying <lb/>
of God, and saving of his Soul; and that where a strong probability <lb/>
of great sin and danger <normalised orig="lyeth" auto="true">lies</normalised> before us, wee must not <lb/>
rashly run on without search, and that to go on against Conscience, <lb/>
even where it is mistaken, is sin and danger to him <lb/>
that <normalised orig="erreth" auto="false">errs</normalised>. And on the other side, wee are <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised>, that <lb/>
in things no way against the Laws of God; the Commands <lb/>
of our <normalised orig="Governours" auto="true">Governors</normalised> must <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> obeyed; but if they command <lb/>
what God forbids, wee must patiently submit to suffering, <lb/>
and every soul must <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> subject to the higher Powers, for conscience <lb/>
sake, and not resist: The <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Judgement, civil, <lb/>
or ecclesiastical, <normalised orig="belongeth" auto="true">belongs</normalised> only to <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> persons, and not <lb/>
to any private man; that no man must <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> <normalised orig="causelesly" auto="true">causelessly</normalised>, and <lb/>
pragmatically inquisitive into the Reasons of his <normalised orig="Superiours" auto="true">Superiors</normalised> <lb/>
commands; nor by pride and self-conceitedness, exalt his <lb/>
own understanding above it’s worth and office, but all to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> <lb/>
modestly, and humbly self-suspitious; that none must erroniously <lb/>
pretend to Gods law, against the just command of his <lb/>
<normalised orig="Superiours" auto="true">Superiors</normalised>, nor pretend the doing of his duty to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> sin; that <lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> who <normalised orig="suspecteth" auto="true">suspects</normalised> his <normalised orig="Superiours" auto="true">Superiors</normalised> commands to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> against <lb/>
Gods Laws, must use all means for full Information, before <lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> settle <choice ana="typeset-error">
                     <sic><normalised orig="iu" auto="true">in</normalised></sic>
                     <corr>in</corr>
                  </choice> a course of disobeying them; and that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> who <lb/>
indeed <normalised orig="discovereth" auto="true">discovers</normalised> any thing commanded to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> sin, though <lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> must not do it, must manage his opinion with very great <lb/>
tenderness and care, of the <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Peace, and the honours <lb/>
of his <normalised orig="Governours" auto="true">Governors</normalised>, these are our Principles: If wee are otherwise <lb/>
represented to your Majesty, wee are mis-represented; <lb/>
If wee are accused of contradicting them, wee humbly crave <lb/>
that wee may not <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> condemned, till wee <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> heard. <lb/>
It is the desire of our Souls to contribute our parts and interests <lb/>
to the utmost, for the promoting of holiness, charity, <lb/>
unity, and obedience to Rulers in all lawful things: But if <lb/>
wee should sin against God, because wee are commanded, <lb/>
who shall answer for us, or save us from his Justice? And <lb/>
wee humbly crave, that it may <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> no just Gravamen of our <lb/>
dissent, that thereby wee suppose <normalised orig="Superiours" auto="true">Superiors</normalised> may <normalised orig="erre" auto="true">err</normalised>, seeing <lb/>
it is but supposing them to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> men not yet in Heaven; and <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
this may <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> reputed to every one that <normalised orig="differeth" auto="true">differs</normalised> in opinion <lb/>
from another. And wee beseech your Majesty to <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised>, <lb/>
that as wee seek no greater matters in the World than daily <lb/>
Bread, with liberty to Preach the Gospel, and Worship God <lb/>
according to his Word, and the practise of the Primitive <lb/>
Churches; so wee hope it is not through Pusillanimity, and <lb/>
over much <normalised orig="tendernesse" auto="true">tenderness</normalised> of suffering, that wee have pleased so <lb/>
much for the avoiding of suffering, to our selves or others. <lb/>
May none of our sufferings hinder the prosperity of the Church, <lb/>
and the good of Souls, and wee have enough. And wee suppose <lb/>
those that think the persons inconsiderable in Number <lb/>
and Quality for whom wee plead, will not themselves <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> <lb/>
that wee have done this for popular applause: this were <lb/>
not so much to seek the reward of Hypocrites, as to play the <lb/>
game of Fools; seeing the applause of inconsiderable men <lb/>
can <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> but inconsiderable, and wee know our selves that <lb/>
we are like thus to offend those that are not inconsiderable; the <lb/>
Lord that <normalised orig="searcheth" auto="true">searches</normalised> hearts, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> know that it is not so much the <lb/>
avoiding of suffering to our selves, or any particular person, <lb/>
that is the end of our endeavours (though this were no Ambitious <lb/>
end) for the peace and welfare of the Church and <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised>, <lb/>
under your Majesties Government. Wee know <lb/>
that supposing them who are for the Ceremonies, to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> as Pious <lb/>
and Charitable as the rest, it cannot so much offend them that <lb/>
another may forbear them, as it must offend another to be forced <lb/>
to use them; and wee know that conscientious men will <lb/>
not consent to the practising of things in their judgement <choice ana="typeset-error">
                     <sic>uulawful</sic>
                     <corr>unlawful</corr>
                  </choice>,<lb/>
when those may <normalised orig="yeild" auto="true">yield</normalised> that count the matter indifferent. <lb/>
And for the management of this Treaty, it being agreed <lb/>
at our first meeting that nothing be reported as the words or <lb/>
sense of either part, but what is delivered by them in writing; <lb/>
Wee humbly crave that your Majesty receive no more as ours, <lb/>
and that what is charged on any particular person, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> may be <lb/>
answerable for himself; and though the Reverend Bishops have <lb/>
not had time to consider our Additions to the Liturgy, and of <lb/>
our Reply, that yet it may be considered before a Determination <lb/>
be made. And though we seem to have laboured in vain, <lb/>
we shall yet lay this work of Reconciliation and Peace at your <lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
Majesties feet, beseeching you to prosper such a blessed Resolution, <lb/>
till it attain success: We must needs <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> that when <lb/>
your Majesty took our Consent to a Liturgy to be a foundation <lb/>
that would infer our Concord, you meant no that wee should <lb/>
have no Concord, but by consenting to this Liturgy, without <lb/>
any considerable Alterations. <lb/>
And when you comforted us with your Resolutions to draw <lb/>
us together, by <normalised orig="yeelding" auto="true">yielding</normalised> on both sides in what wee could, you <lb/>
meant not that wee should <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> the boat to lay the banks that <lb/>
should not stir, and when your Majesty commanded us by <lb/>
Letters Pattents to meet about such Alterations as are needful <lb/>
or expedient for giving satisfaction to render Consciences, <lb/>
and the restoring and continuing of Peace and Unity, wee <lb/>
rest assured, that it was not your sense that those tender consciences <lb/>
were to be forced to practise all which they judged <lb/>
unlawful, and not so much as a Ceremony abated them, or <lb/>
that our Treaty was only to convert either party to the Opinion <lb/>
of another, and that all our hopes of Concord and Liberty <lb/>
consisted only in disputing the Bishops into Non-conformity, <lb/>
or coming in every Ceremony to their minds. <lb/>
Finally, for your Majesty, under God is the protection whereto <lb/>
your people <normalised orig="flye" auto="true">fly</normalised>, and as the same necessity still remains <lb/>
which drew forth your Gracious Declaration, wee most <lb/>
Humbly and Earnestly beseech your Majesty, that the benefit <lb/>
of the said Declaration may <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> continued to the people, and <lb/>
in particular, that none be punished or troubled for not using <lb/>
the Common-Prayer, till it <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> effectually reformed, and the <lb/>
Addition made, as there <normalised orig="exprest" auto="true">expressed</normalised>. Wee crave your Majesties <lb/>
Pardon, for the tediousness of this Address, and shall wait in <lb/>
hope, that so great a Calamity of your people as will follow <lb/>
the loss of so many able, faithful Ministers, as the rigorous Imposition <lb/>
would cast out, shall never be recorded in the History <lb/>
of your Reign, but that these impediments of Concord being <lb/>
forborn, your <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> may flourish in Piety and Peace, that <lb/>
this may be the signal honour of your happy Reign, and your <lb/>
joy in the day of your account, which is the prayer of <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Your Majesties Faithful and Obedient Subjects. <lb/>
FINIS. <lb/>
