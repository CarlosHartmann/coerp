THough I am <normalised orig="senseable" auto="false">sensible</normalised> of the ill <normalised orig="entertainement" auto="true">entertainment</normalised> <lb/>
which the <normalised orig="trueth" auto="true">truth</normalised> in this particular <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> found with those who are <lb/>
wont to flight the grounds which they <lb/>

and dangers, whereunto they are <lb/>

<normalised orig="pretious" auto="true">precious</normalised> and more worth then my name, liberty or life, <lb/>
which I have good reason to despise for his sake, who <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> emptied <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> of all his Glory, and humbled <lb/>
<normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> to the death, even the death of the <normalised orig="Crosse" auto="true">Cross</normalised>, <lb/>

Love of the <normalised orig="Trueth" auto="true">Truth</normalised>, &amp; of <normalised orig="Mee" auto="true">Me</normalised> for the <normalised orig="Trueths" auto="true">Truss</normalised> sake: <lb/>
to <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised> your earnest desire, I put Pen to Paper for <lb/>
your help in that Question, concerning the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> <lb/>
imposed upon the Churches, and used by them for <lb/>
<normalised orig="solemne" auto="true">solemn</normalised> <normalised orig="worshippe" auto="true">worship</normalised> in Assemblies: Examine what I <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/> 
                  <lb/>
write by the Scripture, as in the sight and <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised> of our <lb/>
GOD, whose <normalised orig="yealousie" auto="false">jealousy</normalised> is made <normalised orig="knowen" auto="true">known</normalised> from Heaven <lb/>
against those who presume to <normalised orig="worshippe" auto="true">worship</normalised> him by <lb/>
<normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> inventions and <normalised orig="appoyntments" auto="false">appointments</normalised>, and if it agree <lb/>
with the Scripture, <normalised orig="receave" auto="false">receive</normalised> it for the <normalised orig="Trueths" auto="true">Truss</normalised> sake, <lb/>
if not, reject it. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
AGainst this Prayer <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> divers men have pleaded <lb/>
after a different <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised>. First, some Arguments <lb/>
are proper to the Separatists (qua talis) viz. That <lb/>
it is offered up in a false Church. Secondly, With a <lb/>
false Minister. 3. In the <normalised orig="behalfe" auto="true">behalf</normalised> of the Subjects of the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> of Antichrist: these are properly theirs, <lb/>
being the grounds whereupon they make a <normalised orig="totall" auto="true">total</normalised> Separation <lb/>
from all the Churches in this Land, as no <lb/>
Churches of CHRIST; these I approve not, yet <lb/>
note them, that you may see upon how different <lb/>
grounds the same Position is maintained by <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> <lb/>
persons, and that you may be delivered from the prejudice <lb/>
which hinders many from <normalised orig="receaving" auto="true">receiving</normalised> those <lb/>
<normalised orig="trueths" auto="true">truss</normalised>, because they <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised> the reproach of <normalised orig="Brownisme" auto="false">Brownism</normalised>. <lb/>
Secondly, there are other grounds which are common <lb/>
to all that plead for the purity of Christs <normalised orig="Ordinaunces" auto="true">Ordinances</normalised>, <lb/>
and which <normalised orig="doeth" auto="true">doth</normalised> not necessarily <normalised orig="inferre" auto="true">infer</normalised> such <lb/>
Separation, but <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> serve to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> the <normalised orig="unlawfulnesse" auto="false">unlawfulness</normalised> <lb/>
of that practise, and of our communicating therein, <lb/>
to which purpose I am to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> two things: First, <lb/>
What our exceptions are against the Service <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised>: <lb/>
Secondly, how just they are. <lb/>
First, the exceptions against it, are; First, That <lb/>
it is devised by men; (viz.) other men whom God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/> 
                  <lb/>
not <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic><normalised orig="cal" auto="true">call</normalised>*ed</sic>
                     <corr>called</corr>
                  </choice> to such a work as to invent <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> of Prayers, <lb/>
which should <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> used by all the Churches in a <lb/>
Land, for their Prayers: Secondly, That it is imposed <lb/>
upon the Minister and people of <normalised orig="necessitie" auto="true">necessity</normalised>: Thirdly, <lb/>
That it is stinted both in matter &amp; words, to be used <lb/>
without variation: Fourthly, That it is read out of <lb/>
a <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> that is many <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> faulty and corrupt. <lb/>
Secondly, the <normalised orig="justnesse" auto="true">justness</normalised> of these exceptions against <lb/>
it, may be declared by Reasons. The first Reason, because <lb/>
God did never <normalised orig="commaund" auto="true">command</normalised> to use nor promise to <lb/>
except such a Worship. In which respect it is a manifest <lb/>
breach of the second <normalised orig="Commandement" auto="true">Commandment</normalised>, Exod. 20.<lb/>
<normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>. 4. 5. 6. For if the <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> of Prayers were means <lb/>
of Gods worship, <normalised orig="ordayned" auto="true">ordained</normalised> by God, surely he would <lb/>
have given some light and ground for them in his <lb/>
Word in the <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised> Testament, if ever it had been <normalised orig="needfull" auto="true">needful</normalised> <lb/>
to have helped them with a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of <normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised>, <lb/>
God would have devised one for them, or <lb/>
have given power to the <normalised orig="Priestes" auto="true">Priests</normalised> and Levites to have <lb/>
prescribed one to them, during the <normalised orig="minoritie" auto="true">minority</normalised> and <normalised orig="Pedagogie" auto="false">Pedagogy</normalised> <lb/>
of that Church. But wee <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> no syllable of <lb/>
any such matter in all the Law &amp; the Prophets: what <lb/>
<normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> are there mentioned, are but for some <normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised> <lb/>
occasions, and commanded to the Church (which I <lb/>
pray observe) not from every ordinary Church Officer, <lb/>
Priests and Levites, but <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> from the Prophets, <lb/>
who had an <normalised orig="extraordinarie" auto="true">extraordinary</normalised> and immediate calling <lb/>
from God, &amp; who might as well deliver for Scripture <lb/>
Oracles, the <normalised orig="trueth" auto="true">truth</normalised> of God taught by them, as <lb/>
any <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> of Prayers or <normalised orig="Prayses" auto="true">Praises</normalised>. <lb/>
But we see a <normalised orig="Forme" auto="true">Form</normalised> of blessing is appointed to be <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A 3</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/> 
                  <lb/>
used by Aaron and his <normalised orig="Sonnes" auto="true">Sons</normalised>, Num 6. 24. 25. 26. <lb/>
Therefore a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of prayers may be appointed to <lb/>
the Minister. <lb/>
There is an <normalised orig="apparant" auto="true">apparent</normalised> difference <normalised orig="betweene" auto="true">between</normalised> Prayer &amp; <lb/>
Blessing, in the <normalised orig="sence" auto="true">sense</normalised> of that place; for Prayer is expressed <lb/>
from men to God, but blessing in the <normalised orig="sence" auto="true">sense</normalised> <lb/>
of that place is pronounced from God to man, and <lb/>
therefore the Lord saith, Thus <quote type="biblical" ana="Num 6.23">shalt thou <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> the Children <lb/>
of <normalised orig="Israell" auto="true">Israel</normalised>, and say unto them</quote>, <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>ver*</sic>
                     <corr><normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>.</corr>
                  </choice>2.3. not unto God. <lb/>
And Solomon used a different gesture in praying, and <lb/>
in blessing the people, to note the difference <normalised orig="betweene" auto="true">between</normalised> <lb/>
them, for in praying for them he <normalised orig="kneeled" auto="true">knelled</normalised>, 1. Kings 8.4.5. <lb/>
but <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> stood up when he blessed the Congregation, <lb/>
<normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>.55. according to the rule Deutronomie 10.8. <lb/>
Secondly, if that blessing were a Prayer, yet it <lb/>
will not thence <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> that set <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> are <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised>;<lb/>
for there are who give divers reasons to prove that <lb/>
Moses in that place did not prescribe unto the Priests <lb/>
a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> whereunto they must <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> <normalised orig="tyed" auto="true">tied</normalised> in <lb/>
blessing of the people, but only gave them a rule or <lb/>
direction according to which they should <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> them; <lb/>
nor can the contrary be proved from the Scripture. <lb/>
Thirdly, If it were a stinted <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised>, yet it was <lb/>
not devised by men, but by God <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, who commanded <lb/>
Moses to appoint Aaron thus to <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> the people. <lb/>
From Gods appointing a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of words of his <lb/>
<normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> devising, to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> used in blessing of the people <lb/>
in his Name; it will not therefore follow, that man <lb/>
may appoint a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of words devised by other men, <lb/>
to be used by the Minister praying in the name of the <lb/>
Congregation to God. <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/> 
                  <lb/>
A set of <normalised orig="Forme" auto="true">Form</normalised> is used in singing of <normalised orig="Psalmes" auto="true">Psalms</normalised>; Ergo, <lb/>
it may be used also in Prayer. <lb/>
Singing of <normalised orig="Psalmes" auto="true">Psalms</normalised>, and Praying, differ many <lb/>
<normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised>: <lb/>
First, many <normalised orig="Psalmes" auto="true">Psalms</normalised> are for Instruction <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, <lb/>
wherein is not a word of petition, and those <normalised orig="Psalmes" auto="true">Psalms</normalised> <lb/>
which <normalised orig="co~taine" auto="false">contain</normalised> Prayers, are written for our instruction, <lb/>
&amp; serve to teach us in what <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> we should pray on <lb/>
like occasions, Col.3.16. as all Scriptures were written <lb/>
for our learning, Rom.I5.4. and are profitable to <lb/>
teach, 2. Timoth. 3. 16. But as the reading of them <lb/>
is not the praying of the Church, so neither is the singing <lb/>
of them, which is but loud speaking as it were in <lb/>
a <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> <normalised orig="harmonie" auto="true">harmony</normalised> or tune, the Church praying; <lb/>
for instance the 102. <normalised orig="Psalme" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>, is <normalised orig="intitled" auto="true">entitled</normalised> A Prayer of <lb/>
the afflicted, yet it was not imposed or devised to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> <lb/>
said by every man for his prayer in affliction, but it <lb/>
serves to teach us in what <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> we should <normalised orig="powre" auto="true">power</normalised> out<lb/>
our complaints before the Lord in such cases, and we <lb/>
may, if wee will, take such expressions thence, as may <lb/>
best suite with our occasions, not stinting our selves <lb/>
to those words alone. <lb/>
Secondly, in Prayer, the Minister alone <normalised orig="uttereth" auto="true">utters</normalised> <lb/>
the <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised>, the people adding their Amen in the end, <lb/>
1 Cor.14.6. but in singing, every person in the Church <lb/>
                  <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>pronouceth</sic>
                     <corr><normalised orig="pronounceth" auto="true">pronounces</normalised></corr>
                  </choice> every word and <normalised orig="sillable" auto="true">syllable</normalised> aloud, and in a <lb/>
tune, Ergo, there is a <normalised orig="necessitie" auto="true">necessity</normalised> of having <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> of <lb/>
<normalised orig="Psalmes" auto="true">Psalms</normalised> set <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> in words, not so of Prayers. <lb/>
Thirdly, the <normalised orig="Psalmes" auto="true">Psalms</normalised> are parts of Scriptures, wherein <lb/>
God <normalised orig="speaketh" auto="true">speaks</normalised> unto us, teaching and instructing us, <lb/>
&amp; we our selves, &amp; one another mutually, Ephes. 5. 19. <lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/> 
                  <lb/>
Collos.3.16. therefore it is <normalised orig="necessarie" auto="true">necessary</normalised> to be expressed in <lb/>
<normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised>; but in Prayer wee speak to God, according <lb/>
to <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> occasions. <lb/>
Fourthly, the Penmen of the <normalised orig="Psalmes" auto="true">Psalms</normalised> were Prophets, <lb/>
extraordinarily assisted and <normalised orig="immediatly" auto="true">immediately</normalised> by God <lb/>
designed to that <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised>, so are not the <normalised orig="Authours" auto="true">Authors</normalised> of <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised>. <lb/>
A set <normalised orig="Forme" auto="true">Form</normalised> of Prayer was appointed to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> used <lb/>
when the <normalised orig="Arke" auto="true">Arc</normalised> went forward, and when it rested, <lb/>
Numb. 10. 34. 35. 36. <lb/>
It <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> that it was appointed, the Text <lb/>
saith, Moses <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> these words, but not that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> appointed <lb/>
others to say so, whensoever the <normalised orig="Arke" auto="true">Arc</normalised> should <lb/>
<normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> forward or rest. 2. If Moses did appoint it, <lb/>
yet that is no warrant for us; for Moses was a Prophet, <lb/>
and had an <normalised orig="immediat" auto="true">immediate</normalised> commission from God for what <lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> appointed in the house of God, Hebr.3.2. which <lb/>
the <notvariant>Imposers</notvariant> of the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> can not plead. 3. This <lb/>
Prayer of Moses was but on a particular occasion, <lb/>
and (for ought I know) not used by others afterwards: <lb/>
for wee <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> no mention of it in divers removes <lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Arke" auto="true">Arc</normalised> in Iosuas time, Chap.3.4. to Chap.<lb/>
8. and in Samuels time, 1 Sam. 4. 7 and in Davids <lb/>
time, 2 Sam.6. 15. Now, to plead for the <normalised orig="lawfulnesse" auto="true">lawfulness</normalised> <lb/>
of a set <normalised orig="Forme" auto="true">Form</normalised>, devised and imposed by other men, <lb/>
upon the Ministers to be <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> used, from a <normalised orig="voluntarie" auto="true">voluntary</normalised> <lb/>
act of Moses, used on a particular occasion, but <lb/>
not imposed upon <normalised orig="posteritie" auto="true">posterity</normalised>; what <normalised orig="congruetie" auto="false">congruity</normalised> is <lb/>
therein, judge you. <lb/>
Our Saviour Christ <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> given a <normalised orig="Forme" auto="true">Form</normalised> of Prayer <lb/>
to be used by us, Math.6. Luke 11. therefore a <normalised orig="Forme" auto="true">Form</normalised> <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">8</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/> 
                  <lb/>
of Prayer devised, and imposed by other man, upon <lb/>
the Minister, is <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised>. <lb/>
I <normalised orig="denie" auto="true">deny</normalised> the Argument, for will it follow that because <lb/>
Christ may devise and impose a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised>, therefore <lb/>
men may <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> it? to <normalised orig="parralell" auto="false">parallel</normalised> this with other things, <lb/>
Christs ordinance can make the writings of the Apostles <lb/>
a rule of Faith, can men make another Scripture? <lb/>
or can they appoint their <normalised orig="Homelyes" auto="false">Homilies</normalised> to be used &amp; read <lb/>
in the Churches as the Prophets &amp; Apostles did their <lb/>
writings? Indeed, such a pretence is put upon their <lb/>
<normalised orig="Hommelie" auto="false">Homily</normalised> or Exhortation, added to the prayers appointed <lb/>
for the last <normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> Fasts, that as the Apostles <lb/>
wrote <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> Epistles, which they caused to be <lb/>
read in the Churches, so <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> <normalised orig="Apostolicall" auto="true">Apostolical</normalised> men, <lb/>
had written this Exhortation, &amp;c. You may <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> <lb/>
the words in the <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> whereunto I <normalised orig="referre" auto="true">refer</normalised> you, not <lb/>
having it at hand. Now if this Title (viz.) as <normalised orig="Apostolicall" auto="true">Apostolical</normalised> <lb/>
men, they plead their right to prescribe <lb/>
<normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> to the Churches, let them <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> the <normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> of <lb/>
Apostles, viz. that they have heard and <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> Christ <lb/>
as the Apostles did, Acts 1.21.22. and 22.14. 1 John.<lb/>
1.1. 2. that they have an immediate calling, not of <lb/>
man, nor by man, but of Christ, <normalised orig="Gallat" auto="true">Gallant</normalised>. 1.1. <lb/>
Thirdly, that they have a <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> commission to <lb/>
<normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> forth into all the World, to plant Churches, and <lb/>
are qualified with the gifts of tongues, &amp;c. for that <lb/>
purpose, Matth. 28. 19. <lb/>
Fourthly, that they have infallible assistance of <lb/>
the spirit in all things they impose upon the Churches, <lb/>
and Christs <normalised orig="commaund" auto="true">command</normalised> for the things which they <lb/>
teach men to observe and to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>, as the Apostles had, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">B</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/> 
                  <lb/>
Acts 15.28; <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> 16.13; Math. 28. 20. if not, they <lb/>
will be found false Apostles, Revel.2.2. and must renounce <lb/>
that plea, else both their office &amp; impositions <lb/>
are to be rejected as Antichristian. <normalised orig="Againe" auto="true">Again</normalised>, Christ can <lb/>
appoint Sacraments which men cannot <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>, yet these <lb/>
who presume to devise a <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> for all the Churches, <lb/>
are so <normalised orig="bould" auto="true">bold</normalised> also as to obtrude upon them, teaching <lb/>
<normalised orig="signes" auto="true">signs</normalised> viz. significant ceremonies, as if the Sacraments <lb/>
which Christ <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> appointed, were not sufficient <lb/>
for that purpose, in which respect the Churches <lb/>
ought the more resolutely to set themselves against all <lb/>
humane devises &amp; incroachements in the matters of <lb/>
Religion, lest a <normalised orig="newe" auto="true">new</normalised> rule of Faith in time be devised <lb/>
and imposed by men, as it is in the <normalised orig="Papacie" auto="true">Papacy</normalised>. <lb/>
Secondly, what if this <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> be not imposed by <lb/>
our Saviour, to the end that <normalised orig="beleevers" auto="true">believers</normalised> should be <normalised orig="tyed" auto="true">tied</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> to those words in prayer, as indeed it is not, as <lb/>
wee shall <normalised orig="anone" auto="true">anon</normalised> <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised>, in <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> of the first objection, <lb/>
of the second particular, in the third Reason: Will <lb/>
this at all countenance the impositions of the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> <lb/>
upon the Churches? not at all. <lb/>
A second Reason: because it is Gods Ordinance that <lb/>
the Churches should <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> <normalised orig="edefyed" auto="true">edified</normalised> by their gifts who <lb/>
minister unto <normalised orig="the~" auto="true">them</normalised>, &amp; that in Prayer as well as in Preaching, <lb/>
which I prove in this Order; First, that Prayer <lb/>
and Preaching in the Church are two <normalised orig="especiall" auto="true">especial</normalised> duties <lb/>
of the Minister, Acts 6.2.4. where Praying, could <lb/>
not <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> reading Prayers out of a <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised>, as neither <lb/>
could the <normalised orig="Ministery" auto="true">Ministry</normalised> of <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>theWord</sic>
                     <corr>the Word</corr>
                  </choice>, be reading of an <normalised orig="Homilie" auto="true">Homily</normalised>, <lb/>
for to serve Tables, would not hinder them <lb/>
from <normalised orig="eyther" auto="true">either</normalised> of these. <lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/> 
                  <lb/>
Secondly, Christ <normalised orig="fitteth" auto="false">fitted</normalised> all his servants with gifts <lb/>
for the whole <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Ministri" auto="false">Ministry</normalised>, Ephes.4.8.11.12. <lb/>
2 Cor. 3. 5. 6. he that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> made them able Ministers <lb/>
of the new Testament, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> enabled them to pray, as <lb/>
well as to Preach by their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> gifts; For Prayer is <lb/>
an ordinance of the new Testament as well as Preaching, <lb/>
and they are made able thereunto, not by <normalised orig="shewing" auto="true">showing</normalised> <lb/>
the sufficiency of other men, whose Prayer they <lb/>
read, but their sufficiency is of God, enabling themselves; <lb/>
so that, if any be not gifted for those <normalised orig="workes" auto="true">works</normalised>, <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Worde" auto="true">Word</normalised> <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not warrant the having of them for <lb/>
Ministers of Christ, if they be endued with gifts fit <lb/>
for those <normalised orig="workes" auto="true">works</normalised>, the Word <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not warrant the prescribing <lb/>
to them stinted Prayers or <normalised orig="Homelyes" auto="false">Homilies</normalised>, and <lb/>
why may they not as lawfully <normalised orig="commaund" auto="true">command</normalised> them to <lb/>
Preach by reading of <normalised orig="Homelies" auto="false">Homilies</normalised>, as to pray by reading <lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised>? <lb/>
Thirdly, The manifestation of the spirit, every gift <lb/>
in declaring whereof the spirit is manifested, is given <lb/>
not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> to some men that lived in former times, but <lb/>
to every man, much more to the man of God to profit <lb/>
with all, 1 Cor. 12. 7. For what is there <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> of <normalised orig="extraordinarie" auto="true">extraordinary</normalised> <lb/>
gifts, <normalised orig="holdes" auto="true">holds</normalised> by proportion in all gifts, <lb/>
especially <normalised orig="Ministeriall" auto="true">Ministerial</normalised>: but what Ministerial gift is exercised <lb/>
and manifested in reading Prayers, which every <lb/>
<normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> of 12 or 13 <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> <normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised>, is sufficiently able <lb/>
to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>. <lb/>
Reading of Scripture is a <normalised orig="Ministeriall" auto="true">Ministerial</normalised> <normalised orig="dutie" auto="true">duty</normalised>, and <lb/>
therefore why not reading of Prayers also? <lb/>
Between <normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> reading of Scriptures, &amp; <normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> <lb/>
reading of Prayers, there are at least two differences. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">B 2</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/> 
                  <lb/>
First, the <normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> reading of Scripture is Gods Ordinance, <lb/>
(so is not the other:) The reading of the Law <lb/>
and Prophets is mentioned as parts of Gods <normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="worshippe" auto="true">worship</normalised>, Acts 13.15. But there is no mention from <lb/>
Moses to Christ, of any <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> devised by man, which <lb/>
might not have <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="consealed" auto="false">concealed</normalised>, if it had <normalised orig="bene" auto="true">been</normalised> for the <lb/>
edification of the Church, to set up such <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> of <lb/>
Gods <normalised orig="worshippe" auto="true">worship</normalised> as Liturgies read <normalised orig="publikely" auto="true">publicly</normalised> for the <lb/>
Prayers of the Church. Secondly, Reading of Scriptures <lb/>
simply considered in it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, in the <normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> Assembly, <lb/>
is not the proper <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> of the Minister, but <lb/>
may be done by any member, whom the Church <lb/>
shall appoint thereunto, though <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> be no Minister, <lb/>
as the <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> is in the Reformed Churches beyond the <lb/>
Seas, but the reading of the whole <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> is not permitted <lb/>
to every man, but only such as are made Ministers <lb/>
by the Prelates: now seeing they make such account <lb/>
of this <normalised orig="peece" auto="true">piece</normalised> of service, as to appropriate it to <lb/>
the Minister to read the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised>, and to <normalised orig="binde" auto="true">bind</normalised> him <lb/>
so strictly to the use of it, as they <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>, it <normalised orig="concernes" auto="true">concerns</normalised> <lb/>
both Ministers and People, to see that it <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> warranted <lb/>
by the <normalised orig="Worde" auto="true">Word</normalised>, so to be used in the Churches. <lb/>
The reading of the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised>, hinders not the use of <lb/>
their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> gifts afterwards in the Pulpit. <lb/>
If the Word <normalised orig="enjoynes" auto="true">enjoins</normalised> the exercise of his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <lb/>
gift in Prayer as well as in Preaching, &amp; <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not give <lb/>
warrant to the introducing of any other <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised>, by <lb/>
<normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> devise and <normalised orig="appoyntement" auto="false">appointment</normalised>, wee must be <normalised orig="carefull" auto="true">careful</normalised> <lb/>
as not to take from the Word any ordinance of God, <lb/>
so not to <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised> to the Word, as <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> of worshipping <lb/>
God by the devises &amp; appointment of men. 2. If they <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">12</fw>
                  <pb n="10"/> 
                  <lb/>
may limit them in the <normalised orig="Deske" auto="true">Desk</normalised>, why not in the Pulpit <lb/>
also? 3. The Canon also <normalised orig="stintes" auto="false">stints</normalised> them accordingly a <lb/>
<normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> to be used in the Pulpit, see Canon 55. <lb/>
as well as in the <normalised orig="Deske" auto="true">Desk</normalised>, &amp; in <normalised orig="Norwitch" auto="false">Norwich</normalised> <normalised orig="Diocesse" auto="true">Diocese</normalised> that <lb/>
<normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> is pressed upon the Minister in the Pulpit, and <lb/>
<normalised orig="Canonicall" auto="true">Canonical</normalised> obedience binds <normalised orig="the~" auto="true">them</normalised> thereunto, who have <lb/>
<normalised orig="yeelded" auto="true">yielded</normalised> themselves to be governed by these Canons <lb/>
&amp; Constitutions, so that at last the Church will come <lb/>
to be <normalised orig="wholy" auto="true">wholly</normalised> deprived of the profit of their Ministers <lb/>
gifts, and Christ of the honour of them: for who sees <lb/>
not that the imposing of Prayers devised by other men <lb/>
upon <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>theChurches</sic>
                     <corr>the Churches</corr>
                  </choice>, to be used by <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>allMinisters</sic>
                     <corr>all Ministers</corr>
                  </choice> ordinarily <lb/>
for theirs &amp; the Churches Prayer, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> much derogate <lb/>
from the honour, fruit, and <normalised orig="benefite" auto="true">benefit</normalised> of Christs <lb/>
Ascension into Heaven, &amp; from the love, care, &amp; bounty <lb/>
that he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised>, and <normalised orig="shewes" auto="true">shows</normalised> continually to his Church <lb/>
upon Earth, giving gifts to men, for the <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> of the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Ministerie" auto="true">Ministry</normalised>, and the <normalised orig="profite" auto="true">profit</normalised> of the Churches, Ephes. 4.8.<lb/>
and the 13. 1 Cor. 12. 4.5.6. with Mat. 28. 20. <lb/>
The third Reason: Because God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> appointed <lb/>
other <normalised orig="helpes" auto="true">helps</normalised> for Prayer, (which are sufficient without <lb/>
this.) First particular, the holy Ghost is given to <lb/>
teach us to pray as wee ought, Rom. 8.26. the spirit <lb/>
<normalised orig="helpes" auto="true">helps</normalised> our infirmities, who <normalised orig="knowes" auto="true">knows</normalised> not how to pray <lb/>
as wee ought. How <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> it that? not by a <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> in <lb/>
reading, whereof the Minister offers up his own, and <lb/>
the Churches Prayer to God, (for that will rather <lb/>
<normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> them to more infirmities, and <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> <normalised orig="abillities" auto="true">abilities</normalised> in <lb/>
Prayer) but it self makes requests; first, it provokes us <lb/>
to pray, and <normalised orig="tels" auto="true">tells</normalised> us as it were within, what we should <lb/>
pray, or <normalised orig="frameth" auto="true">frames</normalised> such desires within us by which wee <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">B 3</fw>
                  <pb n="11"/> 
                  <lb/>
request God, as Expositers of the best note interpret <lb/>
that place. <lb/>
A Prayer made by others, and read out of a <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised>, <lb/>
may be <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> to be made by the spirit of God: First, <lb/>
because it assisted him that made the Prayer: Secondly, <lb/>
because the spirit <normalised orig="stirreth" auto="true">stirs</normalised> up his affections who <lb/>
<normalised orig="reades" auto="true">reads</normalised> the Prayers. <lb/>
This Objection the Apostle <normalised orig="seemes" auto="true">seems</normalised> to prevent when <lb/>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> saith, The Spirit it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> makes requests for us, viz. <lb/>
the spirit alone, either <normalised orig="immediatelie" auto="true">immediately</normalised> (or by <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> <lb/>
sanctified and ordained by <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>) makes requests <lb/>
for us, viz. who set our selves to pray (though with <lb/>
many infirmities) which also the <normalised orig="worde" auto="true">word</normalised> following intimates, <lb/>
when <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> gives this for the reason, why the <lb/>
spirit helps our infirmities, for faith <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised>, <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 8.26">Wee know <lb/>
not how to pray as wee ought</quote>. But if such read Liturgies <lb/>
were sufficient, it might <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, though wee <lb/>
know not how to pray as wee ought, yet those that <lb/>
made the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> knew how to pray, and wee pray <lb/>
their prayers; whence it will follow, that it is not sufficient <lb/>
to the intent of that place, that others were <lb/>
assisted in making the Prayers which were read, and <lb/>
that our affections be stirred up in reading those Prayers, <lb/>
<normalised orig="unlesse" auto="true">unless</normalised> our understanding be directed, and our <lb/>
affections <normalised orig="quickned" auto="true">quickened</normalised> by the holy Ghost, to <normalised orig="expresse" auto="true">express</normalised> by <lb/>
our <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> gifts, our <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> requests when we pray for <lb/>
others, or for our selves, and that this is the true <lb/>
meaning of praying in the spirit, &amp; in the holy Ghost, <lb/>
will <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> in <normalised orig="Gallat" auto="true">Gallant</normalised>. 4. 6. Epes. 6. 18. Jude <normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>. 20.<lb/>
1 Cor. 14. <lb/>
The Prayer of the Minister is devised by man, viz. <lb/>
                  <pb n="12"/> 
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, and the people are limited by this Prayer, <lb/>
as much as by a <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised>. <lb/>
The Question is not of Prayer devised by a mans <lb/>
<normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, or of <normalised orig="limitting" auto="false">limiting</normalised> the spirit in the people, but of <lb/>
Prayer devised by others, and imposed, and of <normalised orig="limitting" auto="false">limiting</normalised> <lb/>
the spirit of the Minister, the first is <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised>, the <lb/>
second <normalised orig="sinfull" auto="true">sinful</normalised>: for a man to devise his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> Prayer <lb/>
is a <normalised orig="dutie" auto="true">duty</normalised>, 1 Cor. 14. 15. but to take up for his Prayer <lb/>
the devises of other men, &amp; to be bound to a constant <lb/>
use of them <normalised orig="ordinarilie" auto="true">ordinarily</normalised>, is no where warranted. Again, <lb/>
that the spirit of the people should <normalised orig="joyne" auto="true">join</normalised> with the <lb/>
Ministers spirit in Prayer is an ordinance of Christ, <lb/>
who <normalised orig="ordereth" auto="true">orders</normalised> no more to their parts in that case then <lb/>
to <normalised orig="joyne" auto="true">join</normalised> with him, and so <normalised orig="testifie" auto="true">testify</normalised> it by saying Amen, <lb/>
1 Cor. 14. 16. and therefore it cannot be properly said, <lb/>
that the spirit is <normalised orig="limitted" auto="true">limited</normalised> by his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> ordinance, but <lb/>
when the spirit of the Minister is <normalised orig="streightened" auto="true">straightened</normalised> by <lb/>
<normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> prescribed to him by men without Gods ordinance <lb/>
and appointment, then the spirit is <normalised orig="limitted" auto="true">limited</normalised>, <lb/>
and stinted indeed. <lb/>
If the Minister <normalised orig="prayes" auto="true">prays</normalised> by a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> devising, <lb/>
his spirit is thereby stinted, why may it not as <lb/>
well be stinted by <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised> prayer imposed? <lb/>
Although it be not safe for a Minister to limit <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> <lb/>
to one form of prayer <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised>, though devised by <lb/>
<normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, yet the people may more safely <normalised orig="joyne" auto="true">join</normalised> <lb/>
with him in that then in the other: for two Reasons. <lb/>
First, because that Prayer, being devised by <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, <lb/>
is an exercise of his gift in a measure, and his defect in <lb/>
not exercising it so much as <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> should, is his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="personall" auto="true">personal</normalised> <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>. Secondly, because it is not by mans <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">15</fw>
                  <pb n="13"/> 
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="authoritie" auto="true">authority</normalised> imposed upon him to use that <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised>, but <lb/>
<normalised orig="voluntarilie" auto="true">voluntarily</normalised> taken up of <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, in which case, first <lb/>
they subject not themselves to mans <normalised orig="ordina~ce" auto="false">ordinance</normalised> in Gods <lb/>
worship, as they <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> in the other. Secondly, he may <lb/>
the next day alter his <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised>, (for ought the people<lb/>
<normalised orig="knowes" auto="true">knows</normalised>,) seeing he is free to use it or not, but in the <lb/>
other case, they know no other Prayer can be expected <lb/>
by the people, or may be used by the Minister, then <lb/>
their <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised>. <lb/>
If a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> were not imposed, but every Minister <lb/>
were left unto his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> way, great <normalised orig="inconveniencie" auto="true">inconveniency</normalised> <lb/>
would follow. <lb/>
First, you see the Minister exercise their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> gifts <lb/>
in Prayer in the Pulpit, without any <normalised orig="inconveniencie" auto="true">inconveniency</normalised> <lb/>
following upon it: <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> a reason why it is more inconvenient <lb/>
for them to take that <normalised orig="libertie" auto="true">liberty</normalised> when they <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> <lb/>
in the <normalised orig="Deske" auto="true">Desk</normalised>, then when they preach in the Pulpit? <lb/>
Secondly, this objection casts an imputation upon <lb/>
Christ and the Scripture, as not having sufficiently <lb/>
provided against <normalised orig="inconveniencies" auto="true">inconveniences</normalised> in Gods worship. <lb/>
Thirdly, if none <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> admitted to the Ministry, but <lb/>
those whose <normalised orig="fitnesse" auto="true">fitness</normalised> for the <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> of the <normalised orig="Ministrie" auto="true">Ministry</normalised> is <lb/>
sufficiently <normalised orig="knowen" auto="true">known</normalised> according to Christs ordinance, <lb/>
this <normalised orig="inconveniencie" auto="true">inconveniency</normalised> needs not to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> feared. <lb/>
A second particular: the Scripture <normalised orig="holdes" auto="true">holds</normalised> forth the <lb/>
<normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of Prayer, given by Christ our Lord, for a rule <lb/>
and <normalised orig="patterne" auto="true">pattern</normalised> according to which our Prayer should be <lb/>
framed, Matth.6.9. Luke 11. 1. 4. and therefore men <lb/>
cannot <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised> other <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> hereunto by their appointment, <lb/>
without injury and dishonour to Christ our <lb/>
Lord: for will it not lay an <normalised orig="imputatio~" auto="false">imputation</normalised> of imperfection <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">16</fw>
                  <pb n="14"/> 
                  <lb/>
upon the Rule, and upon Christ, as not sufficiently <lb/>
provided for his Church? If a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> devised and appointed <lb/>
by men be good, seeing <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> left no rule for <lb/>
it in the Scripture, which should perfectly furnish the <lb/>
man of God to every good <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised>, and is written to <lb/>
this end among others, that wee may know how wee <lb/>
ought to behave our selves in the house of God, and <lb/>
therefore what is therein taught must <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> kept without <lb/>
spot unrebukeable, to the appearing of Christ, without <lb/>
adding thereto, or <normalised orig="deminishing" auto="false">diminishing</normalised> from it, and that <lb/>
under a <normalised orig="dreadfull" auto="true">dreadful</normalised> penalty denounced against those who <lb/>
shall presume to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> otherwise. <lb/>
First Objection, Christs appointing a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised>, <normalised orig="seemes" auto="true">seems</normalised> to <lb/>
give allowance to <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> devised by other men, for it <lb/>
<normalised orig="shewes" auto="true">shows</normalised>, that a Prayer not devised by a mans <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, may be <lb/>
offered up to God for a mans <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> Prayer, and if that <lb/>
be so, why may not other men devise a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of Prayer, <lb/>
and impose it upon all the Churches to be used in the <lb/>
<normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> Assemblies? <lb/>
If Christ had appointed this <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> to be used when <lb/>
we pray, as the <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> to intimate, Luke 11. 2. <lb/>
It will not thence follow that men may devise and impose <lb/>
their <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised>, but those 2. things will follow upon <lb/>
it: First, that men must see that Christs <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> be used <lb/>
in the Church when they pray. Secondly, that no <lb/>
man presume to impose another <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of other <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> <lb/>
devising upon the Churches; for instance, suppose God <lb/>
had appointed Aaron to <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> the people <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> in that <lb/>
<normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of words spoken of Numbers the 6. Chapter, it <lb/>
would thence have followed, that Moses must see to it <lb/>
that Aaron used that <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised>, and might not suffer him to <lb/>
<normalised orig="impoase" auto="false">impose</normalised> any other <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of words to be used by the <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">C</fw>
                  <pb n="15"/> 
                  <lb/>
Priests, in blessing the people, Prayer was typed by the <lb/>
<normalised orig="insence" auto="true">incense</normalised> or perfume, which every Morning and Evening <lb/>
was burnt before the Lord, Exod. 30. 7. 8. compared <lb/>
with Psalm 241. 2. Now, when the Lord had devised <lb/>
and appointed a perfume, all men are forbidden to make <lb/>
a composition like that perfume, Exod. 30.35.37. so if it <lb/>
could be proved, that Christ had made that <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> for a <lb/>
Prayer to be used by the Churches, and by <normalised orig="beleevers" auto="true">believers</normalised>, <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> <lb/>
when they pray, <normalised orig="the~" auto="true">them</normalised> the offering up of any other <lb/>
Prayers (made by others) or of our own devising, would <lb/>
<normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> to be as <normalised orig="unlawfull" auto="true">unlawful</normalised>, as the offering of strange <normalised orig="insence" auto="true">incense</normalised>, <lb/>
Exod. 30.9. <lb/>
Secondly, though it be true that Christ give us <normalised orig="libertie" auto="true">liberty</normalised> <lb/>
to use that for a Prayer, being uttered with understanding, <lb/>
yet his purpose is thereby to direct us how to <lb/>
frame all our Prayers, and not to <normalised orig="tye" auto="true">tie</normalised> us to say over these <lb/>
words for our Prayers, as may <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> by these reasons: <lb/>
First, because all the circumstances in both the <normalised orig="Euangelists" auto="true">Evangelists</normalised>, <lb/>
<normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> lead us to understand it thus, for in <normalised orig="Mathew" auto="true">Matthew</normalised> <lb/>
it is part of Christs Sermon wherein <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="shewes" auto="true">shows</normalised>, how <lb/>
<normalised orig="Almes" auto="true">Alms</normalised>, and Fastings, &amp; Prayer, are to be used aright without <lb/>
Ambition, <normalised orig="Hypocrisie" auto="true">Hypocrisy</normalised>, Babbling, and in Luke <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="shewes" auto="true">shows</normalised> them how to come to God in Prayer, as Friends <lb/>
to their Friends, as Children to their Parents, asking <lb/>
Bread, Fish, &amp;c. and making their requests <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised> to <lb/>
God, according to particular wants in Faith, Hope, <lb/>
Love, &amp;c. Secondly, because the two Evangelists <lb/>
<normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not <normalised orig="tye" auto="true">tie</normalised> themselves to the same <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised>, or number <lb/>
of <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised>, in recording that <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of Prayer, which may <lb/>
<normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> to be ordered by a <normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised> providence, to prevent <lb/>
this conceit, for if wee be <normalised orig="tyed" auto="true">tied</normalised> to these <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> which <lb/>
Christ uttered, which Evangelist shall wee follow? <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">18</fw>
                  <pb n="16"/> 
                  <lb/>
Thirdly, because the Apostles did not bind themselves <lb/>
to those words, but used others, according to their <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> <lb/>
occasions, and taught the Churches to whom they <lb/>
wrote (not) to say over those <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised>, but according to <lb/>
their necessities and occasions, to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> their requests <lb/>
unto God, in all <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised>, prayer, and supplication in the <lb/>
spirit, &amp;c. But if Christ had <normalised orig="tyed" auto="true">tied</normalised> us to the use of those <lb/>
words, in that number and order, then it would <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> a <lb/>
<normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised> to pray at any time without using those <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised>, <lb/>
for <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> saith, <quote type="biblical" ana="Lk 11">When you pray, say our Father</quote>. <lb/>
To conclude this passage: If Christ, who is the Lord <lb/>
and Lawgiver to the Church, and knowing the <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> <lb/>
of his Father, was able to frame a perfect and absolute <lb/>
Prayer for his Church, yet did not <normalised orig="holde" auto="true">hold</normalised> it meet to <normalised orig="tye" auto="true">tie</normalised> <lb/>
his people to those <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> which <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> devised, <lb/>
but left the Churches free therein; much <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> <lb/>
may any man impose their devised <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> to be used of <lb/>
<normalised orig="necessitie" auto="true">necessity</normalised>, ordained in the Churches. <lb/>
<normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> taught his Disciples to pray, Luke 11. 1. therefore <lb/>
stinted Liturgies are <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised>. <lb/>
It <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised> in the Scripture, how <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> taught <lb/>
his Disciples to pray, whether by giving them some <lb/>
rules and directions, what petitions they should put up, <lb/>
and in what <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised>, or by composing a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> for them; <lb/>
if the former be meant, so may any man teach another <lb/>
to pray, and those that have the education, &amp; instructing <lb/>
of others, ought to teach those under their charge, <lb/>
but that will give no countenance to set <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised>, whereof <lb/>
the question is. <normalised orig="Againe" auto="true">Again</normalised>, suppose that <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> did propound <lb/>
some <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> or <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of Prayer for the private use of his <lb/>
Disciples, yet it <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not serve to <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> <lb/>
in question: For, first, the times are not alike, for Religion <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">C 2</fw>
                  <pb n="17"/> 
                  <lb/>
among the <normalised orig="Iewes" auto="true">Jews</normalised>, was then so decayed, that it is <lb/>
most probable that there were but few which held the <lb/>
right order of Prayer. Secondly, the promised Redemption <lb/>
being then at hand, it was <normalised orig="necessarie" auto="true">necessary</normalised> that the <normalised orig="mindes" auto="true">minds</normalised> <lb/>
of the <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> should be stirred up to hope and desire <lb/>
of the same; now, suppose <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised>, into divers places of <lb/>
Scripture, did fit some Prayer to the time, and to the <normalised orig="spirituall" auto="true">spiritual</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="kingdome" auto="true">kingdom</normalised> of Christ, which <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> now began to <normalised orig="reveale" auto="true">reveal</normalised>, <lb/>
what is this to our times, who have a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of <lb/>
Prayer sufficient for our direction and <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised>, this way <lb/>
taught by Christ <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, which they wanted in Johns <lb/>
time, else I <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> would have spared his <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>in in</sic>
                     <corr>in</corr>
                  </choice> 
                  <lb/>
this, and have referred them thereunto? Secondly, <lb/>
the <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> of propounding them is not alike, for John <lb/>
indeed taught his Disciples how to pray in private, but <lb/>
did not <normalised orig="tye" auto="true">tie</normalised> them to those very words without variation, <lb/>
which may be thus evinced: Christ taught his Disciples <lb/>
to pray as <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> taught his, but Christ did not so <normalised orig="tye" auto="true">tie</normalised> his <lb/>
Disciples, as <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> proved: therefore <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> did not <lb/>
his, and who can prove that <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> prescribed them to use <lb/>
his words at all, for <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> might give them a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of <lb/>
words which they were not to use for their prayers, <lb/>
but to <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> from thence how to order their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <lb/>
prayers: and so the <normalised orig="Psalmes" auto="true">Psalms</normalised>, which are Prayers, serve to <lb/>
teach us how to pray in like cases, Col.3.16. &amp; many <lb/>
Prayers, printed by good men, may be used by those that <lb/>
are ignorant, to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> them how their Prayers should be <lb/>
framed, provided that they <normalised orig="tye" auto="true">tie</normalised> not themselves to use <lb/>
those <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> for their daily prayers; but the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised>, in <lb/>
question, limits all the Churches to one <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> <lb/>
used of <normalised orig="necessitie" auto="true">necessity</normalised> every Lords day for their <normalised orig="publike" auto="true">public</normalised> <lb/>
prayers. Thirdly, the matter of them is not alike for <lb/>
                  <pb n="18"/> 
                  <lb/>
John taught his Disciples to pray for such things as agreed <lb/>
with the <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> of God in the Scripture, else <lb/>
Christ would have witnessed against that <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised>, and not <lb/>
have taught the Disciples to pray as <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> taught his, but <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> in question, <normalised orig="imposeth" auto="true">imposes</normalised> such Prayers upon <lb/>
the Churches, wherewith a <normalised orig="Beleever" auto="false">Believer</normalised> cannot <normalised orig="joyne" auto="true">join</normalised> in <lb/>
faith, as shall be <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> in the sixth Reason. <lb/>
Other Reformed Churches <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>haueformes</sic>
                     <corr><normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised></corr>
                  </choice>: Ergo, they <lb/>
are <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised>. <lb/>
First, wee are not to consider what other Churches <lb/>
<normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>, but what they ought to <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>, and what the Primitive <lb/>
Churches, planted by the Apostles, did, who are <lb/>
<normalised orig="patternes" auto="true">patterns</normalised> to them and us. Secondly, those <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> are <lb/>
not imposed upon all the Congregations of <normalised orig="necessitie" auto="true">necessity</normalised>, <lb/>
to be used as these are, but are left free, as <normalised orig="appeares" auto="true">appears</normalised> in <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Libertie" auto="true">Liberty</normalised> they take in that particular without rebuke <lb/>
in the Low <normalised orig="Countryes" auto="true">Countries</normalised>. <lb/>
<normalised orig="Publike" auto="true">Public</normalised> Prayers offered up by the Minister in<lb/>
Church Assemblies, must be framed according to the <lb/>
present and <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> occasions of the Church and people <lb/>
of God, (as also <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> private Prayers ought to be ordered) <lb/>
which can not be done when men are stinted to <lb/>
those <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised>; for instance, the Church prayed according <lb/>
to the occasion, when one was to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> left in the <lb/>
place of <normalised orig="Iudas" auto="true">Judas</normalised>, Actor. 1.34. and when the Apostles had <lb/>
<normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> threatened by the <normalised orig="Counsell" auto="true">Counsel</normalised>, Acts 4.24. and when <lb/>
Peter was in prison, Acts 12. 5. In like <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> Paul <normalised orig="intreats" auto="true">entreats</normalised> <lb/>
the <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> of their prayers in requests <normalised orig="suteable" auto="true">suitable</normalised> to <lb/>
this occasion, Rom. 15.30.31.32. 2. Thess. 3. 12. and this <lb/>
is <normalised orig="implyed" auto="true">employed</normalised> when all <normalised orig="Beleevers" auto="true">Believers</normalised> are called upon to watch <lb/>
unto prayer, 1. Pet. 4. 7. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">C 3</fw>
                  <pb n="19"/> 
                  <lb/>
In the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> there are prayers for many occasions, <lb/>
as, change of Weather, times of <normalised orig="Warre" auto="true">War</normalised>, Pestilence, <lb/>
Famine, Visitation of the <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised>, Marriage, &amp;c. <lb/>
Yet there are many other occasions of particular use <lb/>
for that Congregation, and for others, which that <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> <lb/>
points not at; as the choosing of Officers, as, Pastors, <lb/>
Teachers, Elders and Deacons, by the Church, and <lb/>
many other cases, wherein the Church should meet together, <lb/>
according to Christs ordinance, beside those <lb/>
mentioned in the Text of Scripture before <normalised orig="alledged" auto="true">alleged</normalised>. <lb/>
For <normalised orig="proofe" auto="true">proof</normalised> of this fourth Reason, none of which occasions <lb/>
are fitted with any Prayer in the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised>. 2. Those <lb/>
occasions whereunto some Prayers are fitted, should be <lb/>
expressed by the Minister in such words as may have reference <lb/>
to the <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> states and conditions of their <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> <lb/>
Congregations respectively, which is <normalised orig="parte" auto="true">part</normalised> of <lb/>
their watching over their <normalised orig="flocke" auto="true">flock</normalised>, but the <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <lb/>
not this, nor can <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> it. <lb/>
Because the worship of God; by that stinted <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> <lb/>
whereof our question is, is the devise of Antichrist, it <lb/>
being <normalised orig="neerer" auto="true">nearer</normalised> prescribed or used in the <normalised orig="primative" auto="false">primitive</normalised> Churches <lb/>
planted by the Apostles, and recorded in Scripture, <lb/>
but as the <normalised orig="mistery" auto="true">mystery</normalised> wrought to a greater height in declining <lb/>
times of the Church, it was <normalised orig="receaved" auto="true">received</normalised> by little and <lb/>
little, till at last it came to be <normalised orig="compleatly" auto="true">completely</normalised> framed, strictly <lb/>
<normalised orig="injoyned" auto="true">enjoined</normalised>, and every where used in the Papacy, as serving <lb/>
to <normalised orig="maintaine" auto="true">maintain</normalised> superstition, and a <normalised orig="dumbe" auto="true">dumb</normalised> <normalised orig="Idoll" auto="true">Idol</normalised>, reading <lb/>

in <normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised>; this <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> is in English; the <normalised orig="Masse" auto="true">Mass</normalised> <lb/>

Therefore King Edward the sixth in his Letter to the <lb/>
Devonshire men, to convince them, that their <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> <lb/>
was none Service, <normalised orig="tels" auto="true">tells</normalised> them, That it is no other but the <lb/>
<normalised orig="olde" auto="true">old</normalised>, &amp; the <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> same words in English which were in <lb/>
<normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised>, save a few things taken out, which were so <normalised orig="fonde" auto="true">fond</normalised> <lb/>
that it was a shame to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> them in English: and King <lb/>
James in a Speech of his in Scotland, <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, That their <lb/>
English <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> was an ill <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> <normalised orig="Masse" auto="true">Mass</normalised>, and this is made <lb/>
the first of the exceptions against the Common Prayer <lb/>
<normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised>, which were briefly added too, in the Abridgement, <lb/>
that it appointed a <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised>, which in the whole <lb/>
matter &amp; <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> thereof, is too like unto the <normalised orig="Masse" auto="true">Mass</normalised> Book. <lb/>
But the <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> and Petitions are good in those Prayers, <lb/>
therefore the <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> may be lawfully used. <lb/>
Not all the words and Petitions are good, as will be <lb/>
<normalised orig="sheweth" auto="true">shows</normalised> in the sixth Reason. Secondly, good words <lb/>
expressing good Petitions, are not sufficient to prove <lb/>
that their Prayers are good, For, first, a Prayer may be <lb/>
good without words, as the <normalised orig="mentall" auto="true">mental</normalised> Prayer of Annah, <lb/>
1 Sam.1.12.15. Secondly, In <normalised orig="vocall" auto="true">vocal</normalised> Prayer more is <lb/>
required to make it good then good words, viz. Among <lb/>
other things, this, that it proceed from the ability which <lb/>
the spirit of God <normalised orig="bestowes" auto="true">bestows</normalised> on him who utters the words <lb/>
to fit his requests, to the present occasion, <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> 4. 24; <lb/>
1 Cor. 14.15.16. 1 Pet. 4 7. <lb/>
Some of those Exiled in <normalised orig="Queene" auto="true">Queen</normalised> <normalised orig="Maryes" auto="false">Mary's</normalised> <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, for <lb/>
witnessing against <normalised orig="Antechrist" auto="true">Antichrist</normalised>, pleaded for this <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> <lb/>
in <normalised orig="Frankeforde" auto="false">Frankfurt</normalised>, and in the beginning of the Reformation, <lb/>
godly men approved it, and <normalised orig="rejoyced" auto="true">rejoiced</normalised> in it, and <lb/>
since holy men have used &amp; defended it, therefore it may <lb/>
lawfully <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> used. <lb/>
First, I deny the Argument, more particular and <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">23</fw>
                  <pb n="21"/> 
                  <lb/>
distinctly I <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised>: First, that the <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> then pleaded <lb/>
for, was made in Edward the sixts time, and against <lb/>
in Mr. Knox and others witnessed in <normalised orig="Franckeford" auto="false">Frankfurt</normalised>; yea, <lb/>
though his life was <normalised orig="indangered" auto="true">endangered</normalised> thereby, and the loosing <lb/>
of his estate followed upon it, yet he would not <normalised orig="receave" auto="false">receive</normalised> <lb/>
it into the Church, though some pleaded for it, who <lb/>
were not so <normalised orig="throughly" auto="true">thoroughly</normalised> purged from all Antichristian leaven, <lb/>
as was to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> wished, though they witnessed a <lb/>
good confession against the <normalised orig="Masse" auto="true">Mass</normalised>, and Transsubstantiation, <lb/>
&amp;c. Secondly, In the beginning of the Reformation,<lb/>
godly men <normalised orig="rejoyced" auto="true">rejoiced</normalised> not so much in the Prayers, as <lb/>
that the worship of God was <normalised orig="selebrated" auto="false">celebrated</normalised> in our <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <lb/>
Language, whereas before it was in <normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised>, which few <lb/>
understood. Thirdly, holy <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> using and defending it <lb/>
in these <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not prove it more <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised> then <normalised orig="Poligamy" auto="true">Polygamy</normalised> <lb/>
and the taking of Concubines was to the Fathers <lb/>
before Christ, which they used and were ready to <lb/>
defend, if any had spoken against it: in those <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> the <lb/>
holy Apostles are not to be followed otherwise then <lb/>
as they follow Christ, 1 Cor. 11. 1. The <normalised orig="Iewes" auto="true">Jews</normalised> at Antioch <lb/>
and Barnabas was misled by following Peters practise, <lb/>
though a Pillar in the Church without a Rule, Gal. <lb/>
2. 13. Fourthly, In the time of ignorance God passed <lb/>
them by, and us also. But now he <normalised orig="admonisheth" auto="true">admonishes</normalised> all men, <lb/>
to whom the <normalised orig="trueth" auto="true">truth</normalised> is revealed, to repent, Acts 17.30. <lb/>
The Prayer <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> in question, is corrupt in many <lb/>
things, First, the matter of some Petitions, is such as <lb/>
wee cannot say Amen to it in faith, as may be instanced <lb/>
in some Collects, as to instances in one or two for a taste: <lb/>
In the Collect on the 12. Sunday after Trinity, is prayed, <lb/>
that God would forgive us those things whereof our <lb/>
consciences are afraid, &amp; to give unto us that our prayers <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">24</fw>
                  <pb n="22"/> 
                  <lb/>
dare not presume to <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised>. In the Collect for Innocents <lb/>
day, it is said, Almighty God, whose <normalised orig="prayse" auto="true">praise</normalised> this day <lb/>
the young Innocents thy witnesses have confessed, and <lb/>
<normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> forth, not in speaking, but in dying: And in one <lb/>
of the Collects to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> used for Morning Prayer every <lb/>
Lords day, you pray for Bishops and Curates, and all <lb/>
Congregations <normalised orig="co~mitted" auto="true">committed</normalised> to their charge: Now, if Congregations <lb/>
be not <normalised orig="co~mitted" auto="true">committed</normalised> to Diocesan Bishops as they <lb/>
say they are, (pure Divines) &amp; if Pastors of Churches be <lb/>
not their Curates in all the Congregations, or if the Curats <lb/>
under the Pastors of the Churches be not Christs ordinance, <lb/>
then you pray, that plants which God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not <lb/>
planted, should prosper in the Churches, which cannot <lb/>
be done in Faith. To omit divers others, the very fitting <lb/>
of Collects to <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, for holy Fasts, and Feasts <lb/>
not sanctified by God, favour of superstition; as, <normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised> <lb/>
Prayers for Lent, serving to countenance the keeping <lb/>
of it as a Religious Fast, &amp; the Collect on good Friday, <lb/>
and on the holy <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>. Secondly, The <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> of Praying <lb/>
<normalised orig="vaine" auto="true">vain</normalised> Repetitions; as, the often repeating the Lords <lb/>
Prayer; and, Glory to the Father; and, Lord have mercy <lb/>
upon us, &amp;c. not out of fervency as Christ, and David, <lb/>
and Daniel did, but out of <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> <normalised orig="meerely" auto="true">merely</normalised>, this is expressly <lb/>
condemned Matth.6.12. Disorderly Responsaries, the <lb/>
Clarke taking a <normalised orig="parte" auto="true">part</normalised> of the Prayer out of the Ministers <lb/>
mouth, contrary to the I Cor. I5.40. which also <normalised orig="introduceth" auto="false">introduces</normalised> <lb/>
an office into the Church, which God never <lb/>
appointed; as also, the reading Curats are contrary to <lb/>
Ezekiel 44. 8. Now, the Prayer which we cannot offer <lb/>
up in Faith, is contrary to Roman. 14. 23. Heb. 11. v.6.<lb/>
and Chap. 12. 28. 29. <lb/>
Secondly, Besides the <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised>, which for these Prayers <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">D</fw>
                  <pb n="23"/> 
                  <lb/>
sakes is brought into the Church, <normalised orig="perverteth" auto="false">perverted</normalised> the right <lb/>
use of the Scripture, <normalised orig="dismembreth" auto="false">dismembered</normalised> and <normalised orig="mishappieth" auto="false">mishapped</normalised> them <lb/>
for making of Gospels, Epistles, Lessons and Collects, <lb/>
appointed for Feasts of <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> devising, and derived from <lb/>
the Papists, and it <normalised orig="retaines" auto="true">retains</normalised> a corrupt translation of the  <lb/>
<normalised orig="Psalmes" auto="true">Psalms</normalised>, &amp; <normalised orig="bringeth" auto="true">brings</normalised> into the Church Apocrypha writings, <lb/>
and the <normalised orig="errours" auto="true">errors</normalised> contained in them. <lb/>
Some things may be found <normalised orig="amisse" auto="true">amiss</normalised> in the Prayers of <lb/>
Ministers, when they exercise their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> gifts, with <lb/>
which a man cannot <normalised orig="joyne" auto="true">join</normalised> in Faith, yet that which is <lb/>
good is not to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> rejected for that which is <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised>, and <lb/>
why not in this case also? <lb/>
When the Minister <normalised orig="exerciseth" auto="true">exercises</normalised> his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> gift, Gods <lb/>
ordinance is observed, wherewith I may communicate <lb/>
in Praying, as well as in Preaching, notwithstanding <lb/>
his infirmities in either, which are but <normalised orig="personall" auto="true">personal</normalised>, and in <lb/>
such cases the Rule <normalised orig="warranteth" auto="true">warrants</normalised> men to try all things, and <lb/>
to hold that which is good, 1 Thess.5.21. But when the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> is read, an ordinance which is not of God, but <lb/>
of man, is introduced into Gods Worship, contrary to <lb/>
the second <normalised orig="Commandement" auto="true">Commandment</normalised>, and therefore I must reject <lb/>
it, and have no communion with it. <lb/>
Suppose these stinted <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> be not <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised>, yet the <lb/>
fault is not ours, but theirs that impose them. <lb/>
<normalised orig="Vnlawfull" auto="true">Unlawful</normalised> commands in matters of Religion especially, <lb/>
cannot be obeyed without <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>, Hosea 5.11. and it <lb/>
is a <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised> to <normalised orig="walke" auto="true">walk</normalised> after them many <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised>: First, against <lb/>
God, from whose <normalised orig="Authoritie" auto="true">Authority</normalised> so much is derogated as is <lb/>
ascribed to mans ordinance in those matters, 2 Coll 2. <lb/>
22.23. Secondly, against our <normalised orig="Superiours" auto="true">Superiors</normalised>, whose consciences <lb/>
are offended, they being <normalised orig="imboldened" auto="true">emboldened</normalised> to <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>, <lb/>
<normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> they <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> that to be lawfully imposed, which is <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">26</fw>
                  <pb n="24"/> 
                  <lb/>
by us <normalised orig="receaved" auto="true">received</normalised> and <normalised orig="obeyd" auto="true">obeyed</normalised>, 1 Cor.8.10.11.12. Thirdly, <lb/>
against the present age &amp; <normalised orig="posteritie" auto="true">posterity</normalised>, <normalised orig="whilest" auto="true">whilst</normalised> by our <normalised orig="yealding" auto="false">yielding</normalised> <lb/>
to unwarrantable impositions, the reformation is <lb/>
hindered. Fourthly, against our selves, by partaking in <lb/>
other <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised>, 1. Cor. 11. <lb/>
This rather <normalised orig="concernes" auto="true">concerns</normalised> the Minister whose action it is, <lb/>
then the people. <lb/>
Whatsoever worship is offered up to God by the Minister, <lb/>
is in their name, &amp; so the action of the Assembly <lb/>
then present, who are to declare their assent by saying <lb/>
Amen, if it be <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised>, if otherwise to call upon their <lb/>
Minister to <normalised orig="fulfill" auto="true">fulfil</normalised> the <normalised orig="Ministrie" auto="true">Ministry</normalised> which <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="receaved" auto="true">received</normalised> <lb/>
of the Lord, Col.4.17. and as occasion shall require to <lb/>
proceed further to declare their dislike in such a <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> as <lb/>
is meet, either by absenting themselves from it, or by <lb/>
other <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> declaring their dislike, so as the whole <lb/>
Church may take notice of it. <lb/>
What if one <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> on a <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised>, or <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> with others, <lb/>
or <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> some thing else in the <normalised orig="bottome" auto="true">bottom</normalised> of the Seat, whiles <lb/>
the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> is reading, is not it sufficient? <lb/>
<normalised orig="Publike" auto="true">Public</normalised> disorders must be <normalised orig="publikely" auto="true">publicly</normalised> witnessed against, <lb/>
1. Timot.5.20. that the Church may be <normalised orig="edefied" auto="false">edified</normalised>, if that <lb/>
cannot be done, or be to no purpose, men ought to absent <lb/>
themselves from that act of worship wherein they <lb/>
cannot <normalised orig="joyne" auto="true">join</normalised> warrantably. <lb/>
But I cannot <normalised orig="joyne" auto="true">join</normalised> with the Church in some ordinances <lb/>
of God without these: as, in the reading of the Scriptures, <lb/>
and in the Sacraments, and if I <normalised orig="joyne" auto="true">join</normalised> not in <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised>, <lb/>
I may loose many good Sermon in Churches that <lb/>
are much frequented and thronged. <lb/>
The <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> which the Ministers of Scotland in the examination <lb/>
of the five Articles enacted at Perth, whereby <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">D 2</fw>
                  <pb n="25"/> 
                  <lb/>
they <normalised orig="justifie" auto="true">justify</normalised> their not communicating at the Lords Table <lb/>
where the gesture is changed, and distributing the Elements <lb/>
by the Communicants is wanting, will serve for <lb/>
this purpose also by a <normalised orig="parrety" auto="false">parity</normalised> of Reason; they say, wee <lb/>
are all bound to <normalised orig="maintaine" auto="true">maintain</normalised> the <normalised orig="puretie" auto="true">purity</normalised> and <normalised orig="integritie" auto="true">integrity</normalised> of <lb/>
Gods ordinances, and therefore cannot communicate <lb/>
in these cases: no man will be so <normalised orig="carelesse" auto="true">careless</normalised> of his <normalised orig="legge" auto="true">leg</normalised> or <lb/>
<normalised orig="arme" auto="true">arm</normalised>, as to suffer them to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> cut off, but will venture <lb/>
<normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> for their preservation, or the preservation of the <lb/>
least <normalised orig="joynt" auto="true">joint</normalised> of his fingers, howbeit they be not such noble <lb/>
parts of the body, as the head and heart, without <lb/>
which the body cannot subsist, <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> ought we to <lb/>
<normalised orig="tollerate" auto="true">tolerate</normalised> such a horrible stumbling <normalised orig="blocke" auto="true">block</normalised>, as, kneeling <lb/>
in the act of <normalised orig="receaving" auto="true">receiving</normalised> the <normalised orig="Sacramentall" auto="true">Sacramental</normalised> elements eating <lb/>
and drinking, whosoever countenances such Communion <lb/>
is <normalised orig="accessarie" auto="true">accessory</normalised> to that deformation and <normalised orig="mutillation" auto="false">mutilation</normalised>; <lb/>
for if none would communicate with the Ringleaders <lb/>
and Introducers, they would be forced to desist, and <lb/>
had desisted long <normalised orig="agoe" auto="true">ago</normalised>, for shame: the kneeler is the <normalised orig="theef" auto="true">thief</normalised>, <lb/>
the communicant is the <normalised orig="receaver" auto="false">receiver</normalised>. Apply this to the <normalised orig="joyning" auto="true">joining</normalised> <lb/>
in the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> upon the same ground. <normalised orig="Againe" auto="true">Again</normalised>, <lb/>
they <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised>, some <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> they may, if they have <normalised orig="libertie" auto="true">liberty</normalised> <lb/>
to sit themselves, and to reach to the nearest, but they <lb/>
should not <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> to their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="personall" auto="true">personal</normalised> <normalised orig="priviledges" auto="true">privileges</normalised>, <lb/>
but to the <normalised orig="libertie" auto="true">liberty</normalised> of the whole Church and Congregation <lb/>
whereof they are members. If some Citizens <lb/>
would give way to the enemies, upon condition of their <lb/>
<normalised orig="injoying" auto="true">enjoying</normalised> their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="libertie" auto="true">liberty</normalised>, would not they be counted <lb/>
Traitors, and betrayers of the <normalised orig="Cittie" auto="true">City</normalised>? But you will <lb/>
say, Shall I separate from a Church? I <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised>, when <lb/>
a Congregation is <normalised orig="devided" auto="true">divided</normalised>, that part which <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not <lb/>
communicate, is a part of that Church as well as that <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">28</fw>
                  <pb n="26"/> 
                  <lb/>
which <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised>, and both make up one Congregation, or <lb/>
Church, howbeit they be <normalised orig="devided" auto="true">divided</normalised> in that particular action: <lb/>
as both <normalised orig="partes" auto="true">parts</normalised> of the house makes but one house, <lb/>
notwithstanding there be a rift in the wall, yet it is hard <lb/>
say you, to want the benefit and comfort of the Sacrament, <lb/>
but what comfort or benefit can you <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> if you <lb/>
be <normalised orig="accessarie" auto="true">accessory</normalised> to the introduction of such alterations, &amp; <lb/>
setting of such stumbling <normalised orig="blockes" auto="true">blocks</normalised>, in the Congregation? <lb/>
When we cannot communicate but by committing a <lb/>
<normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>, our forbearance is no contempt, and the Lord, <lb/>
who <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> promised to be a little <normalised orig="Sanctuarie" auto="true">Sanctuary</normalised> to his people, <lb/>
when they were to be scattered among the heathen, <lb/>
Ezekiel 11.16. will supply our wants. Doctor Feathly <lb/>
saith, That neither the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> nor <normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised> thing to be <lb/>
regarded in the Sacrament, is our benefit, but Gods <lb/>
glory, and testification of our obedience, to his ordinance. <lb/>
Beza saith, Wee cannot <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> to have <normalised orig="contemned" auto="true">condemned</normalised>, <lb/>
who are not permitted to partake of them as <lb/>
they are appointed by the Lord; <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> be it from us to <lb/>
imagine any causes of <normalised orig="necessitie" auto="true">necessity</normalised> by which wee may violate <lb/>
the Lords ordinance. This <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> may serve, if <lb/>
the case were so hard that they could not have the occasion <lb/>
of the right and pure administration of the Sacraments <lb/>
elsewhere. But (<normalised orig="praysed" auto="true">praised</normalised> be God) as yet they may <lb/>
have it not <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> from the <normalised orig="doores" auto="true">doors</normalised>; these be the <normalised orig="wordes" auto="true">words</normalised> <lb/>

The Rule is <normalised orig="cleere" auto="true">clear</normalised>, wee must not <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised> that good <lb/>

gifts in Preaching, accompany the stinting of the Ministers <lb/>
to <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> in praying, for the <notvariant>imposers</notvariant> <lb/>
thereof accounts the Church sufficiently provided for <lb/>
with the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised>, and the <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> of <normalised orig="Homelies" auto="false">Homilies</normalised>, and values <lb/>
the Ministers more for their <normalised orig="conformitie" auto="true">conformity</normalised> in reading, <lb/>
then for their gifts in Preaching. <lb/>
Some <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> by experience that they have <normalised orig="receaved" auto="true">received</normalised> <lb/>
much good and comfort in the <normalised orig="Worde" auto="true">Word</normalised> and Sacraments, <lb/>
even when they have <normalised orig="joyned" auto="true">joined</normalised> in that <normalised orig="Booke" auto="true">Book</normalised> prayer and <lb/>
stinted Service, therefore it is <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised>. <lb/>
I <normalised orig="denie" auto="true">deny</normalised> the Argument: For, first, the <normalised orig="lawfulnesse" auto="true">lawfulness</normalised> of <lb/>
actions must <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> proved not by events, but by Rule, <lb/>
Mich. 6.8. Secondly, by such reasoning a man may <lb/>
prove all Popish vanities <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised>, as, kneeling in the act <lb/>
of <normalised orig="receaving" auto="true">receiving</normalised>, for they have had much comfort in so <lb/>
<normalised orig="receaving" auto="true">receiving</normalised> their Maker; so, for Organs and Instruments <lb/>
of <normalised orig="Musicke" auto="true">Music</normalised>, to be used in singing <normalised orig="Psalmes" auto="true">Psalms</normalised> in the Church, <lb/>
because some have found their hearts much <normalised orig="cheared" auto="true">cheered</normalised> &amp; <lb/>
lifted up to Heaven almost thereby; so, <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>forImages</sic>
                     <corr>for Images</corr>
                  </choice> to be <lb/>
used, for the <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> of <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> devotion in worshipping <lb/>
God, because some have found their spirits much stirred <lb/>
up by them; so, for saying over so many Pater nosters, <lb/>
Ave <normalised orig="Maryes" auto="false">marias</normalised>, and Prayers by number on their Beads, <lb/>
because many have found much comfort therein. Secondly, <lb/>
That good and comfort whereof men <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>, is <lb/>
in some a <normalised orig="meere" auto="true">mere</normalised> fancy, arising from a false peace within, <lb/>
caused by ignorance, or the silence of <normalised orig="co~science" auto="true">conscience</normalised>; in some, <lb/>
a <normalised orig="meere" auto="true">mere</normalised> delusion of <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised>, whereby he <normalised orig="holdeth" auto="true">holds</normalised> superstitious <lb/>
persons in love with their <normalised orig="blinde" auto="true">blind</normalised> devotions; in <lb/>
some others a common <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> of the spirit, which hypocrites <lb/>
may <normalised orig="feele" auto="true">feel</normalised> in the ordinances, without being accepted <lb/>
                  <pb n="29"/> 
                  <lb/>
in what they <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised>. Lastly, It is in some a sanctifying <lb/>
and saving <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> of the spirit, and then it is Gods <lb/>
blessing upon his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> ordinance, whereunto they prepare <lb/>
their whole hearts, not upon <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> warrantable <lb/>
devises, wherewith they are defiled through ignorance, <lb/>
God mercifully pardoning these ignorances, <lb/>
though <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> is displeased at their inventions, <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>.99.8: <lb/>
But this <normalised orig="helpeth" auto="true">helps</normalised> not them who are willingly ignorant <lb/>
of any duty, or flight any <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised> <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>, Prov.19.16. <lb/>
However, it <normalised orig="pleaseth" auto="true">pleases</normalised> our <normalised orig="mercifull" auto="true">merciful</normalised> God to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> by <lb/>
the times of our ignorance, yet now <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> calls upon us <lb/>
to repent, Act. 17. 30. If now wee shall shut our eyes <lb/>
against the light that is offered, or take liberty to <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>, <lb/>
because wee <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> the matter is not great, what comfort <lb/>
or blessing can wee expect hereafter in any ordinance? <lb/>
<normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 50.16. 17. <lb/>
To conclude, If reading the <normalised orig="Liturgie" auto="true">Liturgy</normalised> <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> the praying <lb/>
which Gods Word <normalised orig="allowes" auto="true">allows</normalised>, wee are bound in conscience <lb/>
to apply our selves to it, as Gods ordinance, and <lb/>
not wee <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>, but also all the Churches throughout <lb/>
the World; If not, we are bound to <choice ana="print-error">
