<normalised orig="manie" auto="true">many</normalised> hard <normalised orig="assayes" auto="true">assays</normalised> with <normalised orig="threatnings" auto="true">threatenings</normalised>, <lb/>
and <normalised orig="terrours" auto="true">terrors</normalised> strangely enforced, rankles your tender <lb/>

of wrath, and <normalised orig="temporall" auto="true">temporal</normalised> losses if <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> <lb/>
shall continue to walk, as <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> learned, and <lb/>
are best <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised>; of <normalised orig="scandall" auto="true">scandal</normalised> and defection, if <lb/>
<normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised> your own old profession, which <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <lb/>
judged, and judge to be most agreeable to the <lb/>
truth; and of shame, and of gnawing of conscience, <lb/>
if <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> shall pollute your self with practises <lb/>
different from your faith, and contrary to the <lb/>
best light, and <normalised orig="likeing" auto="true">liking</normalised> of your own mind. In <lb/>
these difficulties, your case is the more lamentable, <lb/>
that <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> are drawn under <normalised orig="gthe" auto="false">the</normalised> displeasure of <lb/>
high <normalised orig="authoritye" auto="true">authority</normalised>, which, next to God <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> would <lb/>

                  <lb/>
of Christ in all the world, where it <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> found <lb/>
credit. And surely your <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> must be the greater, <lb/>
that, in the day of your sorrow the wise men of <lb/>
your own mind are silent and slack for your help, <lb/>
and your great opposites in this distressed cause, <lb/>
your <normalised orig="neerest" auto="true">nearest</normalised> friends, and old acquaintance, but  <lb/>
without <normalised orig="equall" auto="true">equal</normalised> reason on their part, or <normalised orig="iust" auto="true">just</normalised> desert <lb/>
on yours. Who would not be pierced in heart <lb/>
with the <normalised orig="pittifull" auto="true">pitiful</normalised> <normalised orig="lookes" auto="true">looks</normalised> of your wearied countenance, <lb/>
as at the last <normalised orig="gaspe" auto="true">gasp</normalised> of your wonted <normalised orig="sinceritie" auto="true">sincerity</normalised>, <lb/>
and <normalised orig="chearfull" auto="true">cheerful</normalised> <normalised orig="constancie" auto="true">constancy</normalised>. In this <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, <lb/>
if you be left to your <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, affliction is added to <lb/>
the afflicted, and our mother the <normalised orig="Kirke" auto="true">Kirk</normalised>, and her <lb/>
mother the Truth are forsaken. And notwithstanding <lb/>
of this strait, if any friends of a willing <lb/>
<normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> shall <normalised orig="timously" auto="false">timeously</normalised> contribute to your comfort, <lb/>
some Doeg, or some Amazia is <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> ready with <lb/>
their biting censure, and check of high presumption. <lb/>
But praised be the Lord, there is no small <lb/>
number of religious and honest men in the <normalised orig="kirke" auto="true">kirk</normalised> <lb/>
and <normalised orig="common-weale" auto="true">commonwealth</normalised>, and the hearts of all are in <lb/>
the hands of the Lord, who may at his pleasure <lb/>

<normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> a word in season to you that are <normalised orig="wearie" auto="true">weary</normalised>, <lb/>
also dispose your friends and brethren of their old <lb/>

heart, by their holy <normalised orig="wisedom" auto="true">wisdom</normalised> to <normalised orig="remoue" auto="true">remove</normalised> your <lb/>

                  <lb/>
you rather now to hold fast that which you <lb/>
<normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> heard and <normalised orig="receiued" auto="true">received</normalised>, then <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterwards</normalised> with <lb/>
<normalised orig="vntimous" auto="false">untimous</normalised> repentance to change their tune, and <lb/>
stile, as if you were not a brother, but an <normalised orig="aduersarie" auto="true">adversary</normalised>, <lb/>
and Apostate, if it shall happen, as God forbid <lb/>
that you be driven from the bright candle of <lb/>
your <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised> profession to the <normalised orig="deepe" auto="true">deep</normalised> <normalised orig="darknesse" auto="true">darkness</normalised> of <lb/>
an <normalised orig="unknowne" auto="true">unknown</normalised> way, and by that unhappy change <lb/>
so much the more blinded, as your light <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
been greater, and with the purest <normalised orig="Ivorie" auto="true">Ivory</normalised> turned <lb/>
with fire into saddest black, or <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> be mis-shapen <lb/>
in a new face, stained with the contempt of your <lb/>
first <normalised orig="puritie" auto="true">purity</normalised>, and blushing at the disparagement <lb/>
of your new <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised>. A vile confusion that cannot <lb/>
<normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> eschewed if you shall suffer your <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="drawne" auto="true">drawn</normalised> back <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to the deformities, for <normalised orig="iust" auto="true">just</normalised> <lb/>
causes <normalised orig="casten" auto="true">cast</normalised> out of the kirk, and from that beauty <lb/>
of reformation, which you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> before held, <lb/>
and with <normalised orig="ioy" auto="true">joy</normalised> so long professed, and <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> no better <lb/>
warrant then a bare example, and very <normalised orig="authoritie" auto="true">authority</normalised> <lb/>
of <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> names, although for the time fathers <lb/>
and favourers of your profession, but after long <lb/>
standing now suddenly moved, and so taken with <lb/>
the novelties of the time, that for <normalised orig="ioyning" auto="true">joining</normalised> with <lb/>
them, they dare not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> separate from their old <lb/>
masters and fellow brethren, but from <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised>, <lb/>
in respect of that which they were. And yet in <lb/>
this maine current some way to be excused by <lb/>
their embarking like simple men in a <normalised orig="warre" auto="true">war</normalised> ship, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="4">A 3</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
and miserable mistaking of these base additions, <lb/>
to be <normalised orig="layd" auto="true">laid</normalised> <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> when it should please <lb/>
them like good <normalised orig="schollers" auto="true">scholars</normalised> to <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised> to their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <lb/>
masters, the standard-bearers in our faith, with <lb/>
imagined liberty, not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> to <normalised orig="concurre" auto="true">concur</normalised>, but to <lb/>
<normalised orig="confirme" auto="true">confirm</normalised> and encourage their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> brethren afresh <lb/>
for the advancement of the interrupted <lb/>
<normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> of the ministry and edification of the body <lb/>
of Christ, as they are bound in conscience and <lb/>
calling. <lb/>
But howsoever men <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> been inclined to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> <lb/>
place to the <normalised orig="streame" auto="true">stream</normalised> of the time, yet from the day <lb/>
that the kirk <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been crossed, and many of all <lb/>
sorts grievously afflicted with the perturbations <lb/>
daily arising about the violent inbringing of these <lb/>
intrused alterations: <normalised orig="neverthelesse" auto="true">nevertheless</normalised> you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <lb/>
found some sweet refreshment under the shadow <lb/>
of a heavenly dispensation so ruling the <normalised orig="pathes" auto="true">paths</normalised> of <lb/>
these proceedings, that you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> kept the truth, <lb/>
suffered <normalised orig="reproches" auto="true">reproaches</normalised> and discredit with patience <lb/>
in standing against these misliked novelties so <lb/>
long as they remained without the <normalised orig="compasse" auto="true">compass</normalised> of <lb/>
your <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> practise, esteeming your particular <lb/>
losses contented gain, and your <normalised orig="iniuries" auto="true">injuries</normalised> excusable <lb/>
for keeping the liberties of God, service, and the <lb/>
secret <normalised orig="ioy" auto="true">joy</normalised> of your <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> conscience to be brooked <lb/>
by your quiet carriage, and sober conversation. <lb/>
But now if the day of that <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> ease be passed, <lb/>
and patient walking can <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> no further <normalised orig="fauour" auto="true">favour</normalised>, <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="5">4</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
and if you shall be <normalised orig="drawen" auto="true">drawn</normalised> out to a <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> stage <lb/>
before the Lord, who would <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> you to be his <lb/>
<normalised orig="witnesse" auto="true">witness</normalised>, and in the eyes of men, who would gain <lb/>
you to be their disciples, you must needs by your <lb/>
<normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> practise either shamefully recant, or honestly <lb/>
<normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised> the religion wherein you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> stood. <lb/>
Choose you this day whether with humbled Esther <lb/>
you will wisely <normalised orig="resolue" auto="true">resolve</normalised> to <normalised orig="proue" auto="true">prove</normalised> constant, and <lb/>
glad the hearts of many people, by cleaving to <lb/>
that way wherein you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> found the Saviour <lb/>
with his blessings and benefits of all sorts; or if <lb/>
you will against your <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> experience of Gods <lb/>
favour to you, and hard <normalised orig="successe" auto="true">success</normalised> <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> upon these <lb/>
novations, where they <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> most greedily <lb/>
embraced, hazard by your <normalised orig="vnseasonable" auto="true">unseasonable</normalised> example <lb/>
to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> occasion of stumbling to many, and to <lb/>
loose the patience and labours of your former <lb/>
<normalised orig="constancie" auto="true">constancy</normalised>, and now like Peter overwhelmed <lb/>
with <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised>, adventure to seek your comfort, and <lb/>
<normalised orig="quietnesse" auto="true">quietness</normalised> in the sway of time, as though the Lord <lb/>
could be syled, as <normalised orig="Absolom" auto="true">Absalom</normalised> was with Chusayes <lb/>
<normalised orig="policie" auto="true">policy</normalised>. If you dare suffer committing your <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised> <lb/>
to the will of God, as <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> a faithful Creator, it <lb/>
is his place to temper the <normalised orig="cuppe" auto="true">cup</normalised> of all your troubles, <lb/>
and when he shall be pleased to try and determine <lb/>
your matter before the highest <normalised orig="barre" auto="true">bar</normalised>. But <lb/>
if you shall deny before men the Lord, and his <lb/>
truth once received, he will deny you before his <lb/>
heavenly father, and will not deliver you from <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="6">A 4</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
the <normalised orig="houre" auto="true">hour</normalised> of temptation. <lb/>
It may be that you find not such throng in the <lb/>
narrow way of suffering, as in the broad way of <lb/>
common profession, when religion dwelt in the <lb/>
pleasant land of peace in Halcyone <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> like <lb/>
the Spouse of Christ commanding all, and subject <lb/>
to none. For you must <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised>, that many <lb/>
<normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> well in their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> climate, that <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> neither <lb/>
head nor health to <normalised orig="crosse" auto="true">cross</normalised> the line, and many <lb/>
<normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> <normalised orig="brauely" auto="true">bravely</normalised> with <normalised orig="guilded" auto="true">gilded</normalised> swords about their <lb/>
<normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="doores" auto="true">doors</normalised>, who <normalised orig="flye" auto="true">fly</normalised> the <normalised orig="campe" auto="true">camp</normalised>, and dare not <lb/>
face the Cannon. To <normalised orig="beleeue" auto="true">believe</normalised> in Christ is a <lb/>
great gift, not common to all, but to suffer for his <lb/>
sake is a greater, and given to few. Perhaps it <lb/>
may be, that many living by <normalised orig="gesse" auto="true">guess</normalised>, and more <lb/>
ready upon their own respects to <normalised orig="professe" auto="true">profess</normalised>, then <lb/>
<normalised orig="carefull" auto="true">careful</normalised> to be informed in a truth, and no small <lb/>
number of silly spirits by <normalised orig="giuing" auto="true">giving</normalised> credit to others, <lb/>
and misled in the by-paths of <normalised orig="errour" auto="true">error</normalised>, &amp; some unstable <lb/>
Camelion-like hypocrites inclined to be died <lb/>
with the colour of every <normalised orig="occasionall" auto="true">occasional</normalised> profession, <lb/>
when they shall see the world to <normalised orig="frowne" auto="true">frown</normalised>, may <lb/>
take another way. But <normalised orig="pitie" auto="true">pity</normalised> them, &amp; spare them, <lb/>
praise God for his favour to you, and increase of <lb/>
faith, and patience, and let no gall, and <normalised orig="bitternes" auto="true">bitterness</normalised> <lb/>
of speech, scarcely <normalised orig="becomming" auto="true">becoming</normalised> the <normalised orig="witnesse" auto="true">witness</normalised> of a <lb/>
truth, make any of whatsoever sort <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> inclinable <lb/>
to <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised> to you, and your way, who by <normalised orig="memorie" auto="true">memory</normalised><lb/>
of their former proceedings, in a different <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="7">6</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
course, may be recalled to <normalised orig="loue" auto="true">love</normalised> and <normalised orig="honor" auto="true">honour</normalised> both you <lb/>
and your way. The Apostles <normalised orig="traine" auto="true">train</normalised> may suffice <lb/>
you. If Christ be on your side, who can be against <lb/>
you? You are <normalised orig="debter" auto="true">debtor</normalised> to him that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
guided the steps of your <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised>, &amp; all that is within <lb/>
you to praise him, because in these contentions <lb/>
you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> done what you could in <normalised orig="defense" auto="true">defence</normalised> of the <lb/>
truth, and <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> kept it, and never wronged any <lb/>
man in any matter; so that if it be the pleasure <lb/>
of God you shall suffer, it is because you dare not <lb/>
forsake a <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised> truth, whereby you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> received <lb/>
many rich comforts, and <normalised orig="looketh" auto="true">looks</normalised> for to <normalised orig="reape" auto="true">reap</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="endlesse" auto="true">endless</normalised> <normalised orig="ioy" auto="true">joy</normalised>, esteeming it your <normalised orig="dutie" auto="true">duty</normalised> to <normalised orig="cleaue" auto="true">cleave</normalised> to <lb/>
that which is called in question, as well as to the <lb/>

And with no small joy <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> you beheld her <lb/>

Lords Supper, as straight rules to <normalised orig="rectifie" auto="true">rectify</normalised> the uncomely <lb/>
eye-lasts required to be introduced upon <lb/>
the sound work of this Sacrament. <lb/>
1 Christs practise in the first Supper, qualified <lb/>
with his <normalised orig="commandement" auto="true">commandment</normalised>, <quote type="biblical" ana="Lk 22.19"><normalised orig="Doe" auto="true">Do</normalised> this in remembrance <lb/>
of me</quote>, and with Pauls precept, <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 11.1"><normalised orig="Bee" auto="true">Be</normalised> <normalised orig="yee" auto="true">ye</normalised> followers of me, even as I am of  <lb/>
Christ</quote>, together with the common <normalised orig="maxime" auto="true">maxim</normalised> rightly <lb/>
understood, Every action of Christ is our <lb/>
instruction, should be the perfect <normalised orig="patterne" auto="true">pattern</normalised> of our <lb/>
practise. <lb/>
2 The command, <normalised orig="Doe" auto="true">Do</normalised> this, being grounded <lb/>
upon Christs practise, and <normalised orig="hauing" auto="true">having</normalised> respect <normalised orig="therto" auto="true">thereto</normalised>, <lb/>
cannot be understood, but by the understanding of <lb/>
the particulars practised by him. For as practise <lb/>
and <normalised orig="custome" auto="true">custom</normalised> <normalised orig="obserued" auto="true">observed</normalised> in any matter before a law <lb/>
be made, are the best exponers of the law, and <lb/>
not the <normalised orig="customes" auto="true">customs</normalised> and practises that <normalised orig="creepe" auto="true">creep</normalised> in <normalised orig="afterward" auto="true">afterwards</normalised>, <lb/>
so in this Sacrament, the things done by <lb/>
Christ and his Disciples expone the institution <lb/>
better then the practises &amp; <normalised orig="customes" auto="true">customs</normalised> in the <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> <lb/>
of Dionysius Areopagita, of Iustinus Martyr, <lb/>
of Tertullian, and of the practises of kirkes <lb/>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
in these, or other ages. <lb/>
3 The example and institution of Christ are <lb/>
fully set <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> by Matthew, <normalised orig="Marke" auto="true">Mark</normalised> and Luke, <lb/>
<normalised orig="Euangelists" auto="false">Evangelists</normalised>, and by Paul the Apostle <normalised orig="conioyntly" auto="true">conjointly</normalised>. <lb/>
4 In the night that the Lord was betrayed,<lb/>
for the eating of the Lords Supper, Christ and <lb/>
his Disciples came together in one place, prepared <lb/>
for the eating of the <normalised orig="Paschall" auto="true">Paschal</normalised> <normalised orig="Lambe" auto="true">Lamb</normalised>, and <lb/>
that holy <normalised orig="banket" auto="true">banquet</normalised>. <lb/>
5 In that place where Christ and his Disciples <lb/>
met, there was a Table prepared both for <lb/>
the service of the <normalised orig="Lambe" auto="true">Lamb</normalised>, and for this Sacrament. <lb/>
6 For the reverent eating of this Supper, <lb/>
Christ by <normalised orig="choyce" auto="true">choice</normalised> and no otherwise sate at that <lb/>
Table with his Disciples in the most comely and <lb/>
convenient <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of sitting. <lb/>
7 For visible Elements he <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised> both bread <lb/>
and wine such as were at hand for the time, and <lb/>
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> these two without any mixture. <lb/>
8 To the bread by way of preparation Christ <lb/>
did <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> things: he did take it, he blessed it, he <lb/>
brake it, he <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> it: and for the right <normalised orig="vsing" auto="true">using</normalised> of it, <lb/>
he <normalised orig="spake" auto="true">spoke</normalised> three things to the Disciples, a <normalised orig="commandement" auto="true">commandment</normalised>, <lb/>

10 This service is <normalised orig="reco~mended" auto="false">recommended</normalised> to be continued <lb/>
in the <normalised orig="kirke" auto="true">kirk</normalised>, and frequently used. <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 11.26">For as often <lb/>

Christ and his disciples sate at Table, and they <lb/>
obscuring that assertion by <normalised orig="alledging" auto="true">alleging</normalised> of a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of <lb/>
sitting used by Christ different from your <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised>, <lb/>
and by their law of indifferent things rejecting <lb/>
all <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of sitting, and bringing in kneeling as <lb/>
a more humble and convenient gesture for the sacrament, <lb/>
then Christ <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised>. By <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> of the first <lb/>
Article, binding you to Christs <normalised orig="patterne" auto="true">pattern</normalised>, as you <lb/>
are bound by the Prophet to <normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> taught of God, <lb/>
and consequently not to teach God, so by the Apostles <lb/>
precept, you should be a follower of Christ, <lb/>
and not a reformer either of his practise, or institution <lb/>
<normalised orig="conforme" auto="true">conform</normalised> thereto. And, as for the diversity <lb/>
of <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> of sitting, neither kneeling nor standing <lb/>
being opposite gestures to sitting, can <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> the <lb/>
name of sitting, and consequently Christs sitting <lb/>
was no sort of kneeling. As for the <normalised orig="alledged" auto="true">alleged</normalised> <normalised orig="indifferencie" auto="true">indifferency</normalised>, <lb/>
it is taken away by Christs free <lb/>
<normalised orig="choyce" auto="true">choice</normalised> of sitting expressed in his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> practise, <lb/>
when he was neither straited by any occasion, <lb/>
compulsion, or other inclining cause, but at his <normalised orig="libertie" auto="true">liberty</normalised> <lb/>
might <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="kneeled" auto="true">knelled</normalised>, it pleased him in his <lb/>
<normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="wisedome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised> to choose sitting, as the meetest<lb/>
gesture for his communicants. As for the <normalised orig="humilitie" auto="true">humility</normalised> <lb/>
of kneeling <normalised orig="aboue" auto="true">above</normalised> your humility of sitting, <lb/>
we <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> no great warrant in the word: for there, <lb/>
sitting is <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised> in preaching, in praying, &amp; in the <lb/>
                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>
sacrament, but kneeling <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> in prayer. And yet <lb/>
Christ in his <normalised orig="agonie" auto="true">agony</normalised> <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised> for a more humble <lb/>
<normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised>, falling on the ground upon his face. Of <lb/>
the three gestures used by the Christian world in <lb/>
religious worship, sitting, standing, and kneeling, <lb/>
Christ did choose sitting. And if a <normalised orig="choyce" auto="true">choice</normalised> <lb/>
were to be made of any of the three, kneeling for <lb/>
us is most dangerous, being the outward badge <lb/>
of their confession, who contrary to our faith <normalised orig="beleeue" auto="true">believe</normalised> <lb/>
Christ to be bodily present, either by transubstantiation, <lb/>
consubstantiation, or some <normalised orig="vnknowne" auto="true">unknown</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised>, as also is being the <normalised orig="formall" auto="true">formal</normalised> adoration <lb/>
of a person, and not a <normalised orig="signe" auto="true">sign</normalised> of reverence to <lb/>
be <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> to the <normalised orig="sacramentall" auto="true">sacramental</normalised> elements, or any other <lb/>
thing which moved the <normalised orig="Schoolemen" auto="true">Schoolmen</normalised> to <normalised orig="affirme" auto="true">affirm</normalised>, <lb/>
that if there remained the substance of <lb/>
bread after the consecration, the people would <lb/>
therefore take occasion of Idolatry, and in stead of <lb/>
Christs body would <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> godly worship to the <lb/>
bread, and for avoiding of that idolatry, they <lb/>
thought best to <normalised orig="remoue" auto="true">remove</normalised> away the bread, and bring <lb/>
in transubstantiation. <lb/>
Thirdly, <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> differ from them about the distribution <lb/>
of the bread, you holding that Christ <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> <lb/>
it to them that were next him, and the disciples <lb/>
divided it among <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised>; and they holding <lb/>
that it should be given by the minister his hand <lb/>
delivering it <normalised orig="immediatly" auto="true">immediately</normalised> into the hand of every <lb/>

Your practise, as it is <normalised orig="conforme" auto="true">conform</normalised> to the order <lb/>
of the sacrament, observed in this kirk since reformation <lb/>
began, so it is most conform to the necessary <lb/>
order of Christs actions, and <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of words, as <lb/>
they are set down in the eight article. But their <lb/>
assertion &amp; practise anent distribution, can neither <lb/>
agree with the order of Christs actions, the <lb/>
<normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of his words, nor the practise of this reformed <lb/>
kirk. As for the order of Christs actions, for <lb/>
preparation of the bread, he <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> three things, he <lb/>
took it, he blessed it, he brake it, which of necessity <lb/>
must be understood to be a mystical fraction. <lb/>
And being thus prepared, as he took the bread for <lb/>
them, he <normalised orig="exhibiteth" auto="false">exhibited</normalised>, and <normalised orig="giveth" auto="true">gives</normalised> it to them, <normalised orig="wherby" auto="true">whereby</normalised> <lb/>
they may be assured to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> good right to that <lb/>
bread, and being thus prepared, and made theirs, <lb/>
he <normalised orig="giveth" auto="true">gives</normalised> a <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> <normalised orig="commandement" auto="true">commandment</normalised> to them all <lb/>
to take it, and for the particular form of their taking, <lb/>
that they should divide it among <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised>, <lb/>
according to the direction set <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> in Luke for <lb/>
the right <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> of the cup, Divide it among your <lb/>

of brotherly <normalised orig="loue" auto="true">love</normalised>, is as <normalised orig="necessarie" auto="true">necessary</normalised> to be <normalised orig="vsed" auto="true">used</normalised> upon <lb/>
