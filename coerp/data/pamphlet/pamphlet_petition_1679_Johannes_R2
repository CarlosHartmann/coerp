Most Excellent and Dread <normalised orig="Soveraign" auto="true">Sovereign</normalised>, <lb/>
THE meanest Creatures have access and admittance <lb/>
to the Throne of the King of kings, by the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Bloud" auto="true">Blood</normalised> of Jesus; may I, the meanest of your <lb/>
Subjects, have admittance to your Temporal <lb/>
Throne, by the Dreads and horrible Fears of the <lb/>
secret Effusion of your own and our <normalised orig="Bloud" auto="true">Blood</normalised>, by the unprevented <lb/>
Conspiracy of <normalised orig="Bloud-thirsty" auto="false">Blood-thirsty</normalised> Papists. The meanest Star, <lb/>
as it <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="dependance" auto="true">dependence</normalised> on, and influence from the Sun, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
liberty to dart forth its Nocturnal Beams, when great Phœbus, <lb/>
the Titan of  the World, submerses his refulgent Rays on the <lb/>
Neptune-waves; and now your glorious and Princely Rays <lb/>
are feared <normalised orig="dayly" auto="true">daily</normalised> to set continually, in the Horizon and Neptunian-Sea <lb/>
of Popish and Jesuitical Subtilty, and <normalised orig="bloudy" auto="true">bloody</normalised> Cruelty. <lb/>
Shall faithful Subjects be afraid of a Frown, when <lb/>
Church, State, and Crown are, by Papal Violence, Tumbling <lb/>
down? – Inter majora sydera minora lucerent. The poorest <lb/>
Subject in the Primitive <normalised orig="Raigns" auto="true">Reigns</normalised> of the glorious Kings of <lb/>
Israel, have been permitted to cry, in times of extremity, <lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Sam 14.4">Help, O King!</quote> 2 Sam. 14. 4. And though your magnificent <lb/>
Majesty be ambiently attended with so many Stars of the <lb/>
first magnitude, yet a poor Micaiah may prophecy to the <lb/>
King, and have a clearer prospect of the <normalised orig="Cœlestial" auto="true">Celestial</normalised> <normalised orig="Councels" auto="true">Counsels</normalised> <lb/>

                  <lb/>
upon the heavenly Throne, than the Zedekiah’s with their <lb/>
iron horns, 1 Kings 22. 11. 24. though he be fed with Bread <lb/>
and Water till these Euroclydons be blown over. So, most <lb/>
excellent and glorious Prince, I beg Pardon as prostrate at <lb/>
your most <normalised orig="Soveraign" auto="true">Sovereign</normalised> feet, for this act of seeming-presumption, <lb/>
while I acknowledge my self nothing; yet in the hand of <lb/>
God, things that are not, may instruct things that are. Beside, <lb/>
the present Necessity, the horrid and trembling sounds of <lb/>
the Plot and Plotters Alarming my Ears, my obsequious duty <lb/>
to my King, and love to my Native Country, is the Womb <lb/>
that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> conceived and brought forth this Trembling Babe: <lb/>
Which, although in its Infancy, may, to the future admiration <lb/>
of the securest Lethargists in this Nation, be credited as a Child <lb/>
of Truth, by that time bright Phœbus <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> twice mounted the <lb/>
twelve Herculean Pillars. <lb/>
I remember, it was asserted by that Reverend Bishop James <lb/>
Usher, Bishop of Armagh, sometimes in Ireland, That those <lb/>
Predictions that fell from him (most of which are fulfilled already) <lb/>
were imprinted and engraven on his Spirit: even so are <lb/>
these things that now I write to my <normalised orig="Soveraign" auto="true">Sovereign</normalised> Lord the King <lb/>
and Country. And moreover, if it be true, or like to be true, <lb/>
that is reported to us by the Speech of the Dead, in Nocturnal <lb/>
Visions, as is famously reported by <normalised orig="antient" auto="true">ancient</normalised> Philosophers, <lb/>
as Artemidorus, and the famous Remembrances of Julius <normalised orig="Cæsar" auto="true">Caesar</normalised> <lb/>
his Warning before his Death and fatal Stab in the Roman <lb/>
Senate, cum multis aliis; then have I reason to fear the Impression <lb/>
of these things on my Spirit, and these scaring Visions <lb/>
of the Night, which for some years past I have sustained, <lb/>
concerning the Person and Crown of your Sacred Majesty; <lb/>
and also of him and them who have raised the Thunder and <lb/>
Tempest in this our Horizon. As also the just fears we may <lb/>
have of the sudden Fall of your Life and Crown, by the hand <lb/>
or hands of Papists. And that except your Majesty be miraculously<lb/>
defended by <normalised orig="supream" auto="true">supreme</normalised> Providence, and the timely Remissions <lb/>
by his mighty hand; as also your Royal Adherence, <lb/>
and just and methodical Conjunction to your great Council <lb/>
the Parliament, and so <normalised orig="joyntly" auto="true">jointly</normalised> removing the Nations Grievances, <lb/>
and those things offending the King of Kings, and <lb/>
timely and speedily executing Justice upon the <normalised orig="notorous" auto="false">notorious</normalised> Offenders <lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
of your Majesties Crown and State, and of the Church  <lb/>
of Christ; it cannot be, but that before either your Majesty or <lb/>
we are well aware, they you now by your boundless Clemency <lb/>
indulge beyond Necessity, will give the fatal <normalised orig="stroak" auto="true">stroke</normalised> to your <lb/>
sacred Life, and in yours, to all your Subjects, who have the <lb/>
Breast-plate of Christs Righteousness upon them, and the marks <lb/>
of the Whore of Babylon cashiered from you to the Conformists <lb/>
and Nonconformists; and that I trembling fear in the 1680th <lb/>
year. O! would your Majesty please speedily to extirpate <lb/>
out of your Royal Territories, and this City of London, all <lb/>
those Amalekites that trouble Israel, (I mean the French) <lb/>
that devour and eat the bread out of your Subjects mouths; <lb/>
and may you ever remember, that King Saul for neglecting <lb/>
the Word of the Lord, and not totally destroying Amalek, had <lb/>
his life dishonourably taken from him by a Chip of that block, <lb/>
1 Sam. 15. compared with 2 Sam 1. 13. Antiquity tells us, <lb/>
our English nation was never more blessed with Peace and <lb/>
Prosperity, than when the French Nation were conquered by <lb/>
us; as by Henry the fifth of famous memory, and Henry the <lb/>
sixth, who was crowned in Paris, and planted the Flower-de-luce <lb/>
in Englands garden: But now it is to be feared that the <lb/>
French King will be crowned not in the French, but our English <lb/>
Paris (London) except the providence of the King of <lb/>
kings divert present occurrences, and the prudence of your <lb/>
most Excellent Majesty, in happy Conjunction with your <lb/>
prudent Parliament, prevent it; which that you may, the <lb/>
God of Heaven grant. <lb/>
<normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> a Curse in Gods Word, to be governed or counselled <lb/>
by the Spirit of Jezabel, or by a wicked woman, Isai. 3. 12. <lb/>
15, 16. Hence <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> arose monstrous Pride, and intolerable <lb/>
Oppression, the very bane of Church and State. Who knows <lb/>
but by the hands of such, your Majesty may sustain a Stab <lb/>
or fatal <normalised orig="Stroak" auto="true">Stroke</normalised>! And nothing would more draw the hearts <lb/>
of your Subjects up to the height of true joy, than if it may <lb/>
please your Majesty to abandon such morning-clouds from <lb/>
the Mountain of your Throne: O how glorious would the <lb/>
day shine! It is expressly said by God, the King of kings, <lb/>
Deut. 17. 17. The King <quote type="biblical" ana="Deut 17.17">shall not multiply wives to himself, that <lb/>
his heart turn not away</quote>. And though Solomons Throne was <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="6">B</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
established by God himself, yet it was strange women made <lb/>
his Crown to totter, and his Kingdom to rend asunder. <lb/>
<normalised orig="'Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> the greatest interest to Kings and Princes, to treat the <lb/>
Lords people kindly, who are still by the Papists and Popish <lb/>
affected, called, in scorn and derision, <normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised>: for <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 105.14">he reproved <lb/>
Kings for their sakes</quote>, <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 105. 14,15. <normalised orig="'Twas" auto="true">It was</normalised> the <lb/>
Prodromus to the destruction of Ireland formerly (as says <lb/>
Dr. Usher) to adhere to the Principles and Patterns of Papists; <lb/>
nothing being true they hold, as said the Martyr, but the <lb/>
Doctrine of the Trinity: for Free will, and general Redemption, <lb/>
now embraced by too many, is the Foundation of the <lb/>
Popish Kingdom, first brought into Rome in the fifth Century <lb/>
by Pelagius. <normalised orig="'Twas" auto="true">It was</normalised> the hastening the destruction of Ahaz <lb/>
King of Israel, 2 Kings 16. in that he <normalised orig="joyned" auto="true">joined</normalised> himself to the <lb/>
King of Assyria, <normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>. 7. Nothing can more suddenly <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised> <lb/>
King and Kingdom, than <normalised orig="joyning" auto="true">joining</normalised> Affinity with Popish Princes, <lb/>
because God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> determined to cast that Mountain as a Millstone <lb/>
into the depths of the Sea, Rev. 18. Jer. 50, &amp; 51. and <lb/>
they that will not come out of her when her hour comes, shall <lb/>
perish with her without all peradventure. Besides this, Ahaz <lb/>
goes to Damascus, <normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>. 10. and takes a fashion of the Altar <lb/>
and the Worship, and sends to Urijah the Priest for to take <lb/>
a pattern thereof; which, Isai. 8. caused the Lord to hasten <lb/>
his Judgments, under the figure of Maher-shalal-hash-baz, <lb/>
make haste to spoil, and to the prey make speed. So verily will <lb/>
God make haste to <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised> that Kingdom that shall <normalised orig="patternize" auto="false">patronise</normalised> <lb/>
their Worship, from the grand Idolatry of so impudent an <lb/>
Harlot, Rev. 17. as the Church of Rome is. Alas, our Sun is <lb/>
darkened with Popish Principles, our Moon turned into <normalised orig="Bloud" auto="true">Blood</normalised>, <lb/>
our Stars fallen and falling from Heaven, the true Protestant <lb/>
Profession and Principles; both Universities and Pulpits filled <lb/>
with the Roman Trash that the Martyrs and Fathers of our <lb/>
Protestant Religion <normalised orig="truely" auto="true">truly</normalised> abhorred, and Gods word is silent <lb/>
in: while those few Stars that remain in their Primitive Lustre, <lb/>
are scossingly called Calvinists and Solifidians, as if Christ and<lb/>
his Apostles were not the Patrons of the same Doctrine. <lb/>
May your Majesty be directed by the good Angels of God, <lb/>
to do what may preserve your Life, prevent our Fears, establish <lb/>
your Throne, comfort the Protestant Churches of Christ, <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
and glad the hearts of all your Subjects. Your Majesty <lb/>
knows that the <normalised orig="designe" auto="true">design</normalised> of Monarchy is to preserve your Country <lb/>
in it self, not to betray it. For though those things <lb/>
that God will not set up, be attempted in the breast of Majesty <lb/>
it self, yet it may not prosper, but will tumble down as <lb/>
Babel. In medio Consistit Virtus. The way to make your Kingdom <lb/>
everlasting, and your Crown immovable, is to consult <lb/>
Gods Word and Will, and execute his Commands, cherish <lb/>
his Church, his Doctrine and Truths; banish and subdue his <lb/>
Enemies; and make it the policy of the State, to aim at Gods <lb/>
Glory, the Nations Prosperity, and the Churches Comfort: <lb/>
by permitting the various Interests and <normalised orig="Priviledges" auto="true">Privileges</normalised> of King <lb/>
and People to glide sweetly in their proper Channels, as Law, <lb/>
Reason, and Equity <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> provided, from the Constitutions of <lb/>
Antiquity. Vivat Rex, &amp; Veritas.
