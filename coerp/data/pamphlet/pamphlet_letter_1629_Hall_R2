Your <normalised orig="Lordshippe" auto="true">Lordship</normalised> well <lb/>

had thought that any dash of my <lb/>

might have served to <lb/>
have quitted that ignorant <normalised orig="scandall" auto="true">scandal</normalised>, <lb/>
which was cast upon my <lb/>
<normalised orig="naif" auto="false">naive</normalised> taken assertion, of the true visibility <lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Romane" auto="true">Roman</normalised> Church. <lb/>
The issue proves all otherwise: <lb/>
I <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised>, to my <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised>, that the misunderstanding <lb/>
<normalised orig="tenacitie" auto="false">tenacity</normalised> of some <lb/>

enough, that any occasion should <lb/>

but one <normalised orig="thred" auto="false">thread</normalised> of that seamless <lb/>

<normalised orig="cleare" auto="true">clear</normalised> satisfaction to all Readers; <lb/>
and by this seasonable reconcilement, <lb/>
to stop the flood-gates of <lb/>
contention; I know it will not be <lb/>
unpleasing to your Lordship, that <lb/>
through your <normalised orig="honorable" auto="true">honourable</normalised> and pious <lb/>
hands, these welcome papers <lb/>
should be transmitted to many; <lb/>
Wherein I shall first beseech, yea <lb/>
adjure <normalised orig="al" auto="true">all</normalised> Christians, under whose <lb/>
<normalised orig="eies" auto="true">eyes</normalised> they shall fall, by the <normalised orig="dreadfull" auto="true">dreadful</normalised> <lb/>

judge both the <normalised orig="quicke" auto="true">quick</normalised>, and the <lb/>
dead, to lay aside all unjust prejudices; <lb/>
and to allow the words of <lb/>
Truth, and Peace; I dare confidently <lb/>
say, Let us be understood, <lb/>
and we are agreed. <lb/>
The searcher of all harts knows <lb/>
how far it was from my thoughts <lb/>
to <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> ought in favour of the <lb/>
Roman Synagogue: If I have not <lb/>
sufficiently branded that <normalised orig="Stru~pet" auto="false">Strumpet</normalised>, I <lb/>
justly suffer. <normalised orig="Luthers" auto="true">Luther's</normalised> broad word is <lb/>
by me <normalised orig="alread" auto="true">already</normalised> both safely construed, <lb/>
&amp; sufficiently vindicated. But, <lb/>
<normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> you not say, It is a true visible <lb/>
Church? Do you not <normalised orig="yeeld" auto="true">yield</normalised> some <lb/>
<normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> of communion with these <lb/>
clients of Antichrist? What is, if <lb/>
this be not, favour? <normalised orig="Marke" auto="true">Mark</normalised> well, <lb/>
Christian Reader, and the Lord <lb/>
give thee understanding in all <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">4</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
things: To <normalised orig="beginne" auto="true">begin</normalised> with the <lb/>
latter; No man can say but the <lb/>
Church of Rome holds some <lb/>
Truths; those truths are Gods, <lb/>
and in his right, ours; why should <lb/>
not wee challenge our <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised>, <lb/>
wheresoever we <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> it? If a <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> shall say of Christ, Thou <lb/>
art the <normalised orig="Sonne" auto="true">Son</normalised> of the living God, wee <lb/>
will snatch this truth out of his <lb/>
mouth, as usurped; and in <normalised orig="spight" auto="true">spite</normalised> <lb/>
of him, <normalised orig="proclaime" auto="true">proclaim</normalised> it for our own. <lb/>
Indeed, there is no communion <lb/>
betwixt light and <normalised orig="darknesse" auto="true">darkness</normalised>; but <lb/>
there is communion betwixt <lb/>
light and light; Now all truth is <lb/>
light, and therefore <normalised orig="symbolizeth" auto="false">symbolizes</normalised> <lb/>
with it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>. With that light, <lb/>
therefore, whose glimmering yet <lb/>
<normalised orig="remaines" auto="true">remains</normalised> in their <normalised orig="darknesse" auto="true">darkness</normalised>, our <lb/>
clearer light will, and must hold <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">5</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/> 
                  <lb/>
communion; If they <normalised orig="professe" auto="true">profess</normalised> <lb/>
three Persons in one <normalised orig="Godhead" auto="true">Godhood</normalised>; <lb/>
two natures in one person of <lb/>
Christ; shall we <normalised orig="detrect" auto="false">detract</normalised> to <normalised orig="joine" auto="true">join</normalised> <lb/>
with them in this Christian <normalised orig="veritie" auto="true">verity</normalised>? <lb/>
We <normalised orig="abhorre" auto="true">abhor</normalised> to have any communion <lb/>
with them in their errors, <lb/>
in their idolatrous or superstitious <lb/>
practices, these are their <lb/>
<normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised>, not ours. If we durst have <lb/>
taken their part in these, this breach <lb/>
had not <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised>; Now, who can <lb/>
but say that we must hate their <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised>, <lb/>
and allow their good? It is no <lb/>
countenance to their <normalised orig="errours" auto="true">errors</normalised> that <lb/>
wee embrace our <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> truths; <lb/>
It is no disparagement to our <lb/>
truths, that they have blended <lb/>
them with their errors: Here can <lb/>
be no difference, then, if this communion <lb/>
<normalised orig="bee" auto="true">be</normalised> not mis-taken; no <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">6</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/> 
                  <lb/>
man will say that wee may sever <lb/>
from their common truths; No <lb/>
man will say that wee may <normalised orig="joyne" auto="true">join</normalised> <lb/>
with them in their <normalised orig="hatefull" auto="true">hateful</normalised> <normalised orig="errours" auto="true">errors</normalised>. <lb/>
For the former; <normalised orig="Hee" auto="true">He</normalised> that saith <lb/>
a <normalised orig="theefe" auto="true">thief</normalised> is truly a man, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> <lb/>
therein favour that <normalised orig="theefe" auto="true">thief</normalised>? He that <lb/>
saith, a diseased, dropsied, dying <lb/>
<normalised orig="bodie" auto="true">body</normalised>, is a true (though corrupt) <lb/>
body, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> he favour that disease, <lb/>
or that living <normalised orig="carcasse" auto="true">carcass</normalised>? It is no other, <lb/>
no more that I say of the <lb/>
Church of Rome: <normalised orig="Truenesse" auto="true">Trueness</normalised> of <lb/>
being, and outward visibility, are <lb/>
no praise to her; Yea, these are aggravations <lb/>
to her <normalised orig="falshood" auto="true">falsehood</normalised>: The <lb/>
advantage that is both sought and <lb/>
found in this assertion, is <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <lb/>
ours; as we shall see in the <normalised orig="sequell" auto="true">sequel</normalised>, <lb/>
without any danger of their gain. <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">7</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/> 
                  <lb/>
I say, then, that she is a true church, <lb/>
but, I say <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> is a false <lb/>
Church: True in existence, but <lb/>
false in <normalised orig="beleefe" auto="true">belief</normalised>: Let not the <normalised orig="homonymie" auto="false">homonymy</normalised> <lb/>
of a word breed jarres, <lb/>
where the sense is accorded: If <lb/>
we <normalised orig="doe" auto="true">do</normalised> not <normalised orig="yeeld" auto="true">yield</normalised> her the true being <lb/>
of a Church, why do we call <lb/>
her the Church of Rome? What <lb/>
<normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> we of? or where is the subject <lb/>
of our question? who sees <lb/>
not that there is a <normalised orig="morall" auto="true">moral</normalised> trueness, <lb/>
and a <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised>? He that is morally <lb/>
the falsest man, is, in nature, as <lb/>
truly a man, as the honestest; and <lb/>
therefore in this regard as true a <lb/>
man: In the same sense therefore <lb/>
that wee say the <normalised orig="Devill" auto="true">Devil</normalised> is a true <lb/>
(though false) spirit; that a cheater <lb/>
is a true (<normalised orig="thogh" auto="true">though</normalised> false) man, we may <lb/>
and must say, that the Church of <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">8</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/> 
                  <lb/>
Rome us a true (though false) <lb/>
Church; <normalised orig="Certainely" auto="true">Certainly</normalised>, there <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
<normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> a true <normalised orig="errour" auto="true">error</normalised>, and mis-taking <lb/>
of the sense that is <normalised orig="guiltie" auto="true">guilty</normalised> of <lb/>
this <normalised orig="quarrell" auto="true">quarrel</normalised>. As for the visibility, <lb/>
there can be no question: Would <lb/>
God, that Church did not too <lb/>
much fill our <normalised orig="eie" auto="true">eye</normalised>, yea the world; <lb/>
There is nothing wherein it <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised>  <lb/>
more pride it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, that in a glorious <lb/>
<normalised orig="conspicuitie" auto="false">conspicuity</normalised>, scorning, in <lb/>
this regard, the obscure <normalised orig="paucitie" auto="false">paucity</normalised> <lb/>
of their opposers. <lb/>
But you say, What is this but <lb/>
to play with ambiguities; That <lb/>
the Church of Rome is it <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, <lb/>
that is, a Church; that it is visible; <lb/>
that it is truly existent, there can <lb/>
be no <choice ana="typeset-error">

                     <corr>doubt</corr>
                  </choice>; but is it still a part <lb/>
of the truly existent, visible church <lb/>
of Christ? Surely, no otherwise <lb/>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
than an <normalised orig="hereticall" auto="true">heretical</normalised> and <normalised orig="Apostaticall" auto="false">Apostatical</normalised> <lb/>

or into a dangerous precipice of <lb/>
<normalised orig="errour" auto="true">error</normalised>. There is no <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised>, nor favour <lb/>
to say, that the Church of <lb/>
Rome, under a Christian face, <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> an Antichristian heart; overturning <lb/>
that foundation by <normalised orig="necessarie" auto="true">necessary</normalised> <lb/>

<normalised orig="claime" auto="true">claim</normalised> to a true outward <normalised orig="visibilitie" auto="false">visibility</normalised> <lb/>
of a Christian Church; whiles <lb/>
those damnable inferences are enough <lb/>

Now, this <normalised orig="heresie" auto="true">heresy</normalised>, this <normalised orig="Antichristianisme" auto="false">Antichristianism</normalised> <lb/>
makes Rome justly odious, <lb/>
and execrable to God, to Angels, <lb/>

But is not this language different <lb/>

Truth, clad in a different, but <lb/>
more <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> <normalised orig="habite" auto="true">habit</normalised> of words; <lb/>
But if any mans fervent <normalised orig="zeale" auto="true">zeal</normalised> <lb/>
shall rather draw him to the liking <lb/>
of that other, rougher, and <lb/>
harder way, so as in the <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> <lb/>

of Christian <normalised orig="charitie" auto="true">charity</normalised>, I <normalised orig="taxe" auto="true">tax</normalised> him <lb/>

in a desire of peace, <lb/>

Those whom I strive to <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised>, <lb/>
are <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> mis-takers; whose <lb/>

yet I have condescended to <lb/>
take off by a serious deprecation, <lb/>

It is an unreasonable motion <lb/>
to request <normalised orig="mindes" auto="true">minds</normalised> prepossessed <lb/>
with prejudice to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> reason; <lb/>
Whole Volumes are nothing to <lb/>

them, because they know where <lb/>

if ought at all needed. <lb/>
Alas, my Lord, I see and <lb/>

In another habit, I, long since, <lb/>
