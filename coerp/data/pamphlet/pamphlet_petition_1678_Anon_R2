               <head>TO THE <lb/>
RIGHT HONOURABLE <lb/>
THE <lb/>
Lords and Commons <lb/>
Assembled In <lb/>
PARLIAMENT, <lb/>
The Humble Remonstrance and Petition <lb/>
of English Protestants against <lb/>
English and Irish Papists.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
IT is not a time now to Dispute but Act, and that vigorously <lb/>
too, or England’s lost. POPERY, that Enemy to God,<lb/>
by setting up Idols; to Christ, by its New-found Mediators; to <lb/>
the Holy Ghost, by putting a Pope in his place; to the Scriptures, <lb/>
by its Legends and corrupt Traditions; to Reason, by its <lb/>
imposed Absurdities; to common Sense, by its most foolish but <lb/>
most <normalised orig="idolized" auto="true">idolised</normalised> Transubstantiation; to all tender dissenting Consciences <lb/>
by Fire and Faggot; and to all Civil Government that refuse <lb/>
to be subject to it, by Plots, Assassinations and horrid <normalised orig="Massacrees" auto="false">Massacres</normalised>, <lb/>
its usual and notorious steps to Worldly Advancement. <lb/>
This monstrous Popery, this common Enemy to Mankind, that <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> so often contrived our Ruin, and several times been at the <lb/>
very point of effecting it, has once more attempted us, and with <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(2)">A</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
that Violence and Design that it looks like the last time: Nay, <lb/>
the great Sticklers of it are got within our Works, and promise <lb/>
themselves the <normalised orig="Guarrison" auto="false">Garrison</normalised>, because they say they have Friends in <lb/>
Disguise among us. ‘<normalised orig="Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> true, they have lost some Men in the <lb/>
Attempt, but they are not much daunted at that; for the whole <lb/>
Papal World they <normalised orig="bragg" auto="true">brag</normalised> have conspired their Success, and the <lb/>
Air Rings with the Thousands of Masses that are daily said for the <lb/>
Prosperity of the Design, as if their Intention were to convert <lb/>
the World, and not to Kill the King, Garble the Parliament, <lb/>
Shamble all good and sober Protestants of every Party, Fire and <lb/>
Plunder <normalised orig="Citie" auto="true">City</normalised>, and finally, Change the Government and Religion <lb/>
of the Kingdom, which is the Plot. <lb/>
Nor will the more impudent of them deny the thing in general, <lb/>
but much the contrary, insulting to us with Tertullians Implavimus <lb/>
omnia against the old Pagans, We fill your Courts, your <lb/>
Armies, your Navies, it must take, you can’t avoid it; ‘<normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> a just <lb/>
Cause to extirpate <normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised> Root and Branch. <lb/>
But one (and may be the worst) part of the Plot has fail’d <lb/>
them, they <join original="resolv’d"><normalised orig="resolvd" auto="false">resolved</join></normalised> to <normalised orig="surprize" auto="true">surprise</normalised> you, to make a Night Work of <lb/>
it, to let you and yours never see day more (for such Deeds become<lb/>
Darkness) as they did in France and Ireland in those most <lb/>
Bloody <normalised orig="Massacrees" auto="false">Massacres</normalised> of poor harmless Protestants. But God, the <lb/>
infinitely good and gracious God, that <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> <normalised orig="watcht" auto="true">watched</normalised> over <lb/>
this poor Island (an hundred times design’d to destruction) and <lb/>
whose Eye <normalised orig="pierceth" auto="true">pierces</normalised> through the Secrets of men, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> notwithstanding <lb/>
the Greatness, as well as multitude of our Sins (not to <lb/>
be equalled by any thing but his Patience and Compassion) discovered <lb/>
this impious, Conspiracy we hope too early for the Plotters <lb/>
Purpose; he has beaten up our Quarters, and given us the <lb/>
Alarm, if we will take; methinks we should, where the Noise <lb/>
of Fire and Sword is in our Ears; when we cannot walk the <lb/>
Streets without Danger of being stabbed, nor sleep in our Houses <lb/>
for fear of being burned, witness the dreadful Fire at London, <lb/>
the Fire of Southwark, and that the other day of Limehouse, <lb/>
where three poor Souls were burned quick, to say nothing of <lb/>
forty Attempts they have made in other places. To which let <lb/>
me add the Design in general of <normalised orig="Massacreeing" auto="false">Massacring</normalised> all the best People <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(3)">(2)</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
in the Kingdom, begun and amply confirmed in the most barbarous <lb/>
Murder of that Worthy Knight and Judicious Magistrate <lb/>
Sir Edmundberry Godfry; and here I must stay a while. Murder is <lb/>
a great Sin against God and our Neighbour; but alas! what <lb/>
induced them to it here? Sir Edmundberry Godfry was one of <lb/>
the Mildest Men to these Bloody Papists that was in Commission<lb/>
for the Peace; for though he hated Arbitrary Power and Popery, <lb/>
as the Cause or Effect of it, yet a Man for a due Liberty <lb/>
to all sober People pretending Tenderness of Conscience, and <lb/>
saved them from many a Pinch on that score, hoping, as many <lb/>
more did, that after an hundred years Experience, Intermarriages, <lb/>
Conversation and large Indulgence, they were grown wiser, <lb/>
if not more Christian than to cut their Way to Government <lb/>
through Blood, and Kill for Religion (pardon me the use of the <lb/>
word about Popery, that has nothing of Religion but the Name) <lb/>
but Gratitude restrains not men of his stamp, their Principle <lb/>
knows no Kindred, no Obedience, no Obligation that stands in <lb/>
the way of their conspired Dominion. Well <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr/>
                  </choice> but was it that <lb/>
they would be revenged of him, for having Courage (Courage <lb/>
I say, as the World goes) to take Depositions upon Oath of <lb/>
their Devilish Plot? But where’s the Crime here, which can <lb/>
properly give their Act the term of Revenge, since Examination <lb/>
is neither Judgment nor Execution? even a Saint is not <join original="injur’d"><normalised orig="injurd" auto="false">injured</join></normalised> <lb/>
to be <normalised orig="examin" auto="true">examine</normalised>’d, much less a Papist: <normalised orig="Innocency" auto="true">Innocence</normalised> gets on <normalised orig="Tryal" auto="true">Trial</normalised>, if <lb/>
<normalised orig="falsly" auto="true">falsely</normalised> accused; but that’s not the Case; for Truth seeks no <lb/>
Corners, nor yet Ditches to lay a Murder’d Man in after having <lb/>
Strangled him in a House for the purpose: What then can <lb/>
be the plain English of the business but this, that they concluded, <lb/>
his former Kindness thus abused would forever <normalised orig="disingage" auto="true">disengage</normalised> him for <lb/>
the future; and that since he could not be prevail’d upon to stifle <lb/>
the Evidence he had and might yet have produced (for he <normalised orig="acknowledg" auto="true">acknowledge</normalised>’d <lb/>
to some, he had been both tamper’d with &amp; <join original="menac’d"><normalised orig="menacd" auto="false">menaced</join></normalised>) <lb/>
they would strangle him; which is such a Demonstration of their <lb/>
Folly as well Malice <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> given of the whole to be true, that <lb/>
none can now deny it to be a Plot but those that are of it, or <lb/>
will lose by the Discovery. <lb/>
But some say, He Killed himself. That’s a likely Business indeed; <lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
for what I pray? a sober, Charitable, judicious Man. O <lb/>
But he was <normalised orig="Melancholly" auto="true">Melancholy</normalised>, that is, he was a serious man; but why <lb/>
now more <normalised orig="Melancholly" auto="true">Melancholy</normalised> than ever, because he had wronged the <lb/>
innocent Papists? Is that it? Where’s the Wrong? is it, That <lb/>
he heard what Persons upon Oath declared of the most horrid <lb/>
Conspiracy that ever was on foot in the World; but the Murdering <lb/>
of the Son of God? but be this Deposition true or false, it <lb/>
was his Duty and Place to take it, he was Sworn to do it, it was <lb/>
a great and the best part of his Office; he had <normalised orig="deserv" auto="true">deserve</normalised>’d a Plotter’s <lb/>
Punishment to have refused the thing. Here is no Virulency, Suborning <lb/>
of Evidence, Condemning or Murdering them in all <lb/>
this: Where’s the Sin then that should trouble his Conscience? <lb/>
But they that will Murder, will <normalised orig="Lye" auto="true">Lie</normalised> to cover it. <lb/>
Besides, ‘<normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> plain that he was strangled, and his neck broke before <lb/>
stab’d, because he could neither strangle himself nor break <lb/>
his Neck after he was Stab’d through his Heart, nor Stab himself <lb/>
after he was Strangled, and his Neck broke: moreover had <lb/>
he been Stab’d before dead or soon after, Blood would have appeared <lb/>
on the Hilt of his Sword on which he lay, or on the <lb/>
Ground, it being a dry place, or on his <normalised orig="Cloaths" auto="true">Clothes</normalised>; but no Blood <lb/>
was to be seen; and when the Sword was drawn out of his Body <lb/>
which his Murderers put in to paliate the Butchery; nothing <lb/>
issued from him but a dark Water, as is usual where Blood is coagulated, <lb/>
as his doubtless was before he was Stab’d: for we are of <lb/>
Opinion there was a good time betwixt Strangling and <normalised orig="Stabing" auto="false">Stabbing</normalised> <lb/>
him, and that the latter was upon great deliberation, and that <lb/>
on purpose to hide the Actors, and cast the Murder upon himself. <lb/>
O Lord God! that ever Men should be so much the Children <lb/>
of the Devil; as first to Murder, then charge it upon the <lb/>
Innocent Soul Murdered. But the Devil was ever a Fool, and <lb/>
so in this. For besides what we have observed, this further is to be <lb/>
said, they that killed him would have us think ‘<normalised orig="twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> himself, because <lb/>
neither <normalised orig="Cloathes" auto="true">Clothes</normalised>, nor Money, nor Rings were taken away. <lb/>
True, but though they that are concerned in the Plot <lb/>
wanted neither his <normalised orig="Cloathes" auto="true">Clothes</normalised>, nor Money, nor Rings, to carry it on, <lb/>
yet they took what they wanted, and they wanted what they <lb/>
took with a witness, and that was his Pocket-Book of Depositions <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(5)">(4)</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
and Examinations, which puts it out of doubt that they that <lb/>
were so much concerned in them, both Murdered him and took <lb/>
it; for none can think that Father Coniers, the D. of Norfolks <lb/>
Confessor taking the Air over Hedge and Ditch to Primrose Hill, <lb/>
<normalised orig="dropt" auto="true">dropped</normalised> just upon him and <normalised orig="pickt" auto="true">picked</normalised> his Pockets of the Book: Well, but <lb/>
why may he not have Hang’d himself, and his Kindred to save his <lb/>
Estate Stab’d him afterwards, and carry him thither? This is <lb/>
deadly cunning; but why was his Pocket-Book only wanting, <lb/>
wherein the Plotters were concern’d? Tricks won’t do here: <lb/>
furthermore, why did they not keep his Gold, Silver, and <lb/>
Rings that were found in his Pocket, but expose them? why not <lb/>
strip him in some degree, make wound in his Sword Arm, and <lb/>
hack, bend or break his Sword that it might look like Robbery? <lb/>
But last of all; why should they carry him out exactly <lb/>
as he used to go quite <normalised orig="drest" auto="true">dressed</normalised>, and want a Band, especially since <lb/>
they were so punctual as to take his Sword, Belt, Gloves and <lb/>
Stick with them. He went out in the Morning with a great <lb/>
<join original="lac’d"><normalised orig="lacd" auto="false">laced</join></normalised> Band, none was found, as well as the Book of Examinations; <lb/>
of that we have already spoke; for the Band ‘<normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> a plain case they <lb/>
Strangled him, and being a <normalised orig="long-Neckt" auto="false">long-necked</normalised> Man, and wearing an high <lb/>
strong Collar, he <normalised orig="strugling" auto="true">struggling</normalised> to save himself, and they striving to <lb/>
dispatch him that way, the Band was torn in the Fray, and to <lb/>
have let it go so, had been to have <normalised orig="tould" auto="true">told</normalised> the Story too plainly, <lb/>
that is, that the Man was Strangled to Death by Violence, &amp; that <lb/>
the stab of his own Sword was an after-trick to cover the business. <lb/>
Thus this poor Gentleman, but worthy and brave Patriot, <lb/>
ended his <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> by the Assassinating Hands of Papists, whose <lb/>
Butchery made him the Common Martyr of his Religion and <lb/>
Country, and his Death is to us the Earnest of their Cruelty; <lb/>
in him they have <join original="Massacree’d"><normalised orig="Massacreed" auto="false">Massacred</join></normalised> us all, we must take it to ourselves, <lb/>
and can no more be unconcerned in his Death, than <normalised orig="disinteressed" auto="false">disinterested</normalised> <lb/>
in the Cause of it. <lb/>
The Plot is opened, the Tragedy is begun, our Wives are frighted, <lb/>
our Children cry; no man is sure of his Life a day; the choice is <lb/>
only, what Death we shall <normalised orig="dye" auto="true">die</normalised>, whether be Stabbed, Strangled <lb/>
or Burned. This Consternation and Insecurity must needs obstruct <lb/>
all Commerce, scare people from following their lawful <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(6)">B</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
Occasions, deter all Officers of Justice from their Duty, and <lb/>
in fine, dissolve humane society, and reduce the World into its <lb/>
first Chaos. <lb/>
For the Lord’s sake let us consider our Condition, let us all <lb/>
turn to the Lord with unfeigned Repentance, let us look and cry <lb/>
to him for Help, that he who has discovered would confound this <lb/>
Bloody Conspiracy, and <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> Mercy, and bring us Deliverance, <lb/>
that we may yet see his Salvation, and serve him all the <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> of <lb/>
our Lives; and in order to our Security, these things are earnestly <lb/>
requested of you. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
First, Take effectual Care to preserve the King; they say and <lb/>
we believe he is not for their turn; we would not have him for <lb/>
his sake and ours: In order to this, pray find out the Achitophels, <lb/>
the Dangerous men about him; you know who they are; Be free <lb/>
and bold, prize your time, the Conjuncture is great. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Secondly, Vote an Address to the King to Banish all Irish Papists <lb/>
out of the Army, Navy and Kingdom by such a Day, and <lb/>
all Papists out of the City of London, whose gross Ignorance <lb/>
and base Desperateness renders them the fittest men for Assassinations. <lb/>
Besides, it is a shame that the Children and Kindred of <lb/>
Irish Rebels, nay some of them the very men themselves that <lb/>
were Actors in that horrid <normalised orig="Massacree" auto="false">Massacre</normalised> in the year 1640. about <lb/>
thirty seven years since, in which above Three Hundred Thousand <lb/>
Protestants were Murder’d in the Kingdom of Ireland, <lb/>
without regard to Age or Sex, should be employ’d either in the<lb/>
English Army or Navy; but more scandalous is it, that St. James’s <lb/>
should be their Head Quarters, and the Park turned into an <lb/>
Irish Walk. What do so many Irish Papists Teigs and Rebels do <lb/>
swarming there? No Good to be sure; their Parts, Courage <lb/>
and Skill can invite no man of any to entertain them; it must only <lb/>
be their Ignorance and Cowardly Cruelty which make them <lb/>
Instruments of Mischief, and fit to be used by those that love soul <lb/>
play. But that poor dissenting Protestants should be daily molested <lb/>
and <normalised orig="pilledged" auto="false">pillaged</normalised> for the sake of their peaceable Consciences, <lb/>
whilst Teigs and Irish Rebels go by whole droves under the Nose <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(7)">(6)</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
of King and Duke in their Royal Park, and Walks of Pleasure, <lb/>
is almost insupportable. Is this to maintain Protestant Religion, <lb/>
and discountenance Popery? Expede Herculem.
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Thirdly, For God’s sake call for the Plot, look thoroughly <lb/>
and strictly into it; fear not favour no man; Fiat Justitia: <lb/>
But fear God, do what you do as in his Presence, to whom you <lb/>
must render an <normalised orig="Accompt" auto="true">Account</normalised>. ‘<normalised orig="Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> the great Action of your Life, <lb/>
discharge your Trust, and quit your selves now like Men. This <lb/>
has been the perpetual Troubler of our Protestant-Israel; as you <lb/>
would see God with Comfort, and secure your Posterity from <lb/>
civil and spiritual Tyranny, slip not this Opportunity God has <lb/>
so wonderfully cast into your hands; be not found Despisers of <lb/>
his Providence, neither be you careless or fearful of improving <lb/>
it; Now or Never: had they you on this Lock, and at this Advantage, <lb/>
you nor yours should never see Day more. What <lb/>
once you could not have so well done before, they have now <lb/>
made <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> and necessary for you to do; and what before you <lb/>
scarcely might do, is now become your Duty. Be not cheated <lb/>
by a Sacrifice; let not the Lives of two or three Plotters be the <lb/>
<normalised orig="Ransome" auto="true">Ransom</normalised> of the rest, or your Satisfaction; ‘<normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> not Blood but <lb/>
Security, prospect future Safety, an Eternal Prevention of the <lb/>
like Miseries for the future; otherwise we shall only sit down <lb/>
with the Peace and Joy of Fools, and sat our selves Sacrifices <lb/>
with more Security against their next Slaughter. Therefore, <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Fourthly, Raise the Trane-Bands, and let them be put not so <lb/>
much as into the hands of men Popishly affected, for those men <lb/>
that would pull off the <normalised orig="Visard" auto="true">Vizard</normalised> in case Popery prevailed, that otherwise <lb/>
keep their Credit by not discovering themselves, are the <lb/>
most dangerous to be Trusted; I fear Popery thus <normalised orig="entring" auto="true">entering</normalised> more <lb/>
than any other way: examine the Counties well, for some of <lb/>
base Principles are entrusted. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Fifthly, Let there be Power given to raise Auxiliaries, that <lb/>
such honest Protestant-Gentlemen as are willing at their own <lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
Charges voluntarily to serve their Country by raising Troops or <lb/>
Companies, or serving in them, may be permitted and encouraged <lb/>
so to do. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Sixthly, Let every Protestant Family be well Armed, and <lb/>
every Popish Family be utterly disarmed; they have <normalised orig="tryed" auto="true">tried</normalised> our <lb/>
usage of Arms with ease, we theirs with Cruelty enough. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Seventhly, Let there be an Act with a <normalised orig="strickt" auto="true">strict</normalised> Penalty, that after <lb/>
such a Day, no Gun-Smith shall sell Guns or Pistols, Cutlers <lb/>
Swords or Daggers, and dry Salters, Gunpowder or Bullets, <lb/>
without License of the Aldermen of the Ward in London, or <lb/>
some chief Officer, if in any other Corporations, and that the <lb/>
Person so buying them shall before the said Officer subscribe a <lb/>
sufficient Test against Popery; but more especially that no Papist <lb/>
be suffered to make or sell any such Implements of War. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Eighthly, That care be taken to prevent fraudulent <normalised orig="Conveiences" auto="false">Conveyances</normalised> <lb/>
of Estates by Papists to escape the Law where they have done mischief <lb/>
for this is to cheat the Government, and invalidate the Law.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Ninethly, That it shall be Treason for any Papist to Entertain <lb/>
a Priest, Jesuit or Seminary in their House, because mortal Enemies <lb/>
by Principle and Practice to the civil Government. Consider <lb/>
of the Swedish Law, or a better way to clear the Land of all <lb/>
of them; let’s buy them out to be safe. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Tenthly, That in all Schools, particularly in Universities, care <lb/>
be taken to Educate Youth in a just abhorrence of <normalised orig="Romish" auto="true">Roman</normalised> <lb/>
Principles, especially the Jesuits immorral <normalised orig="morrals" auto="false">morals</normalised>, <normalised orig="shewing" auto="true">showing</normalised> <lb/>
the inconsistency thereof with human Nature, Reason and Society <lb/>
as well as pure and meek Christianity; of which there has <lb/>
been great neglect.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Eleventhly, That our Youth be not suffer’d to travel abroad, but <lb/>
between twelve and sixteen, and that under the Conduct of approved <lb/>
Protestants; for the present way of Education is chiefly <lb/>
to pleasure and looseness, which makes way for Atheism or <lb/>
Popery, no Religion, or false Religion. <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(9)">(8)</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
Twelfthly, That speedy care be taken to release all oppressed <lb/>
Protestants in this Kingdom; and since the Papists mark all Protestants <lb/>
out for one fate, and esteem them one Body of <normalised orig="Hereticks" auto="true">Heretics</normalised>, <lb/>
that they may be as one Body of Protestancy against that common <lb/>
Enemy. This is the Language of Gods present Providence, those <lb/>
that withstand it are such a love Rome better then London: every <lb/>
Protestant, Dissenter or not, has the same thing to say against <lb/>
Popery. Agree then so far, and let a general Negative Creed be <lb/>
concluded upon, and from thence let some general Positive Truths <lb/>
be considered of, in order to a better understanding among <lb/>
them: For this purpose, let there be a select Assembly of some <lb/>
out of All <normalised orig="Perswasions" auto="true">Persuasions</normalised>, in which these two <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>Porposals</sic>
                     <corr>Proposals</corr>
                  </choice> may be <lb/>
<normalised orig="duely" auto="true">duly</normalised> weighed, that whosoever Believe and Own what shall be <lb/>
therein contained, shall be Reputed and Protected as true Protestants. <lb/>
                  <lb/>
Lastly, and more especially, Let all the Laws in force against <lb/>
<normalised orig="immorallity" auto="false">immorality</normalised> be speedily and effectually executed: ‘<normalised orig="Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> Sin which <lb/>
is the Disease and Shame of the Nation; we have forgotten God, <lb/>
and cast his Law behind us, and we deserve nor this beginning of <lb/>
Deliverance: Our Pleasures have been our Gods, and to them <lb/>
we bow, and have little or no Religion at Heart; therefore ‘<normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> <lb/>
that Iniquity abounds, and in that variety too, and to such a degree <lb/>
as no Kingdom can parallel. Blush, O Heavens, and be <lb/>
Astonished O Earth, a People loved of God, and so often saved <lb/>
by his <normalised orig="wonderfull" auto="true">wonderful</normalised> <normalised orig="Providences" auto="true">Providence</normalised>, are become the Tyre and Sidon, <lb/>
the Sodom and Gomorrah of the World. Let us Repent in Dust <lb/>
and Ashes; let us turn to God from the bottom of our hearts, <lb/>
with the fervent Love and good Works of our martyr’d Ancestors, <lb/>
or their Life, Doctrine and Death will rise up in <lb/>
Judgment against us, and God will yet suffer their and <lb/>
our Enemies to swallow us up quick. And be assured, <lb/>
as Looseness and Debauchery were design’d by the Papists <lb/>
as a State trick to dispose the minds of the People to receive, <lb/>
at least suffer Popery (that to say true cannot live with <lb/>
better Company) so the discouragement of it, and cherishing <lb/>
of all <normalised orig="vertuous" auto="true">virtuous</normalised> persons, with a serious and hearty prosecution <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(10)">C</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
of the <normalised orig="forementioned" auto="true">aforementioned</normalised> Proposals, will stop, and in time wear it <lb/>
out of the Kingdom; for Popery fears nothing more then Light, <lb/>
Inquiry, and Sober Living. Hear us, we beseech you, for Jesus <lb/>
Christ’s sake; take heart, we will never leave you, don’t you leave <lb/>
us: Provide for the King, provide for the People; for God <lb/>
alone knows when we lie down, if we shall ever rise, or when <lb/>
we go forth, if we shall ever return. Remember the <normalised orig="Massacree" auto="false">Massacre</normalised> <lb/>
of Paris, in which so many thousands fell, and with them that <lb/>
brave Admiral Coligny, infamy enough one would think to shame <lb/>
the Party, did they know such a thing; but instead of that, ‘<normalised orig="twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> <lb/>
Meritorious, yea ‘<normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> subject or Triumph; look into the Vatican <lb/>
at Rome, and among the other rare Feats perform’d by Christian <lb/>
Kings against Infidels; this <normalised orig="Massacree" auto="false">Massacre</normalised> of Paris now about 100. <lb/>
years old, is to be found, and so <normalised orig="carefull" auto="true">careful</normalised> was the Designer to <lb/>
do it to the life, that he has not omitted to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> us how the <lb/>
Noble Admiral was flung dead out of the Window into the <lb/>
Street, to be used as people use Cats &amp; Dogs in Protestant Countries, <lb/>
but good enough for an <normalised orig="Heretick" auto="true">Heretic</normalised>, whom the worse they use, <lb/>
the better they are: But to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> they own the Plot, and glory in <lb/>
the Action, and for fear one not read in the Story should take <lb/>
Coligny for Jezabel, they have gallantly explained the Action <lb/>
upon the Piece, and writ his name at large  <lb/>
But there is a Cruelty nearer Home, no less barbarous, the <lb/>
Irish <normalised orig="Massacree" auto="false">Massacre</normalised> in 1640. nay, it exceeded: first in number, there <lb/>
were above Three hundred thousand Murder’d: Next, in that <lb/>
no Age or Sex was spared: And lastly in the manner of it,  ‘<normalised orig="twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> <lb/>
general throughout the Kingdom; and as they were more Savage, <lb/>
so more Cruel, they spared not either Sick or Lying-in <lb/>
Women; they kill’d poor Infants, and innocent Children, tossing <lb/>
some upon their Swords, Skeens, and other Instruments of Cruelty; <lb/>
flinging others into Rivers, and taking several by the <lb/>
Legs, <normalised orig="dasht" auto="true">dashed</normalised> their Brains out against Walls or Rocks, O Lord <lb/>
God avenge this Innocent Blood, it still <normalised orig="crys" auto="true">cries</normalised>: But that these <lb/>
Actors of this Tragedy, or their Bloody-minded Off-spring <lb/>
should swarm in England be Pensioners here, as if they were <lb/>
the old <normalised orig="Souldiers" auto="true">Soldiers</normalised> of the Queen, men of Eighty eight, Cripples <lb/>
of Loyalty, laid up for their good Services, and St James’s their <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="(11)">(10)</fw>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
Hospital; this <normalised orig="scandalizes" auto="false">scandalises</normalised> us: we think them the worst <normalised orig="Cattel" auto="true">Cattle</normalised> <lb/>
of their Country, and pray that there may be an exchange, that <lb/>
you would prohibit their Importation instead of more <normalised orig="usefull" auto="true">useful</normalised> <lb/>
Beasts. For the bloody <normalised orig="Massacree" auto="false">Massacre</normalised> of Piedmont, you have it at <lb/>
large described by Sir S. Morland.<lb/>
But we must never forget the horrid murder of Henry the third, <lb/>
and of Henry the fourth of France, our Kings renowned Grand-Father. <lb/>
And would to God our King would consider that all his <lb/>
Humanity to them can never secure him from their <normalised orig="stroak" auto="true">stroke</normalised>; they <lb/>
were both better <normalised orig="Catholicks" auto="true">Catholics</normalised>, and yet both Assassinated; the <lb/>
first a bred Papist, yet because he would not Murder all the <lb/>
Hugonots or Protestants of his Kingdom, and his known best Subjects, <lb/>
they did as much for him: The last was their Convert, all <lb/>
they seem’d to desire of him, and all they can expect from our <lb/>
King, yet how did they use him? they did twice assassinate <lb/>
him, and the last time kill’d him. What security then can any <lb/>
Prince promise to himself from men that make not the profession <lb/>
of the same Religion, a  protection to them that own it, but upon <lb/>
<normalised orig="humors" auto="true">humours</normalised> or suspicions of their own, or to introduce another <lb/>
Person or Family, more immediately under their influence, and <lb/>
disposed to their turn, will make no scruple of killing him? What <lb/>
Slaves are Kings with such men, and under such a <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>R*ligion</sic>
                     <corr>Religion</corr>
                  </choice> ? let <lb/>
not the mildness of our Prince be thus abused; show yourselves <lb/>
his great and best Council in this Conjucture, and deliver him <lb/>
from these men of ingratitude: Men that will never be contented <lb/>
but with that which they must not have; of such Qualifications, <lb/>
that what may be esteem’d Ambition, Revenge or Interest in all <lb/>
other parties, is a settled Principle with them: This their greatest <lb/>
Doctors tell us, and to excite men in the <normalised orig="persuit" auto="true">pursuit</normalised> of it, they <lb/>
declare all such Acts more then ordinarily meritorious: But what <lb/>
hold can we have of such men that have no Conscience? this conclusion <lb/>
looks hard, and besides their practice (for if that were <lb/>
<normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> to cast the Scale, it would go hard with many Protestants <lb/>
too; ‘<normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> their avowed Doctrine, they Glory in it and <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>maae</sic>
                     <corr>make</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
it our reproach to have any such thing. I say, that Papists have <lb/>
no Conscience, or no use of Conscience in their Religion, which <lb/>
is the same thing; for what is Conscience but the Judgment a<lb/>
man makes in himself of religious matters according to the knowledge<lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
given him of God; But this is out of Doors with them, <lb/>
‘<normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised>; Authority rules them, not Truth; as if a man were <lb/>
to be credited for his Age, not his Reason. Conscience is a <normalised orig="domestick" auto="true">domestic</normalised> <lb/>
and private Judge, dangerous to the Chair, the Pope, for <lb/>
it rather hinders then helps subjection, the less there be of it, the <lb/>
sooner men turn Captives to their Mysteries: So that putting <lb/>
out the Eyes of our Mind, and a Blind before our Understandings, <lb/>
best fit us for Popish Religion: as if Religion had not so <lb/>
great an Enemy as Reason, nor Faith as knowledge. ‘<normalised orig="Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> strange <lb/>
that a man cannot be a Papist without renouncing the only distinction <lb/>
of a Man from a Beast: Therefore it is we pray to be <lb/>
secured from Papists, because at best they unman us, and are <lb/>
not their own men. ‘<normalised orig="Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> true, as Protestants don’t <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> live <lb/>
up to their good Principles, neither do Papist, to their <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> Ones, <lb/>
Breding, good <normalised orig="Humor" auto="true">Humour</normalised>, Generosity (and a better Principle they <lb/>
know not of) may <normalised orig="byase" auto="false">bias</normalised> some of them to worthy things, <lb/>
but this is not according to their Principles; for if they will be <lb/>
true to them, they must abandon choice, and obey their Superior, <lb/>
Right or wrong, and every immorality he commands is duty <lb/>
upon Damnation; the more contrary to their Reason, and averse <lb/>
to their Nature, the greater the Merit. Hesitation is weakness, <lb/>
Dissent, Schism; Opposition, <normalised orig="Heresie" auto="true">Heresy</normalised>; the Consequence, Burning: <lb/>
From this Religion, O Lord God deliver us, O King and Parliament <lb/>
protect us: ‘<normalised orig="Tis" auto="true">It is</normalised> your duty to God and your obligation to <lb/>
the people. We beseech you excuse us and take all in good part; <lb/>
our fears are great, we fear just, and our desires reasonable: <lb/>
Remember our dreadful Fires, consider this horrid Plot, and <lb/>
think upon poor, yet worthy Sir Edmonbury Godfry; let not <lb/>
God’s providence and his Blood rise up in judgment against you, <lb/>
God of his great Mercy <normalised orig="annimate" auto="true">animate</normalised> you by his power, and direct <lb/>
you by his wisdom, that the Succession of his deliverances from <lb/>
Queen Elizabeth’s <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, may not be forgotten, nor his present <lb/>
Mercy slighted; Let us do our duty and God will give us that <lb/>
blessing which will yet make England a glorious Kingdom, the <lb/>
joy of her Friends, and terror of her Enemies, which is the <lb/>
fervent and constant prayer of yours, &amp;c. <lb/>
