And from all which we must therefore conclude,<lb/>
That it is a very vain thing to place any confidence<lb/>
in Man upon this first Account, viz. That the<lb/>
Power, even of the greatest Persons, to Help us is<lb/>
exceeding Small; exposed to so many Casualties,<lb/>
and attended with such <normalised orig="Inconveniencies" auto="true">Inconveniences</normalised>, as renders<lb/>
it of very little Use, and of no <normalised orig="Dependance" auto="false">Dependence</normalised> at all<lb/>
to us.<lb/>
But (2dly) Were the Case quite otherwise;<lb/>
were there any Order of Men so perfect, in all<lb/>
other Respects, that they Could supply us with All<lb/>
that we should ever be likely to Want, and Would<lb/>
give us whatsoever we should Desire: And were<lb/>
their Inclinations towards us so <normalised orig="Fixt" auto="false">Fixed</normalised> and Immutable,<lb/>
that we might depend upon them that they would<lb/>
never forsake us, but be at all times ready to <choice ana="print">

                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
us whatsoever we should ask of them: Yet still<lb/>
their Life is so Uncertain, and, at the best, so Short;<lb/>
that it would be a very vain thing for us, after all,<lb/>
to set up your Trust and Confidence upon them.<lb/>
For alas! Where is the Man so Great and Self-sufficient,<lb/>
that can secure himself the next Hours<lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
Breath? And in the <normalised orig="heighth" auto="false">height</normalised> of all his Fortune<lb/>
presume to say, that to Morrow shall not lay him<lb/>
Equal with the Dust, and return him to the Earth<lb/>
from whence he was taken?<lb/>
It is an extraordinary Character which the Holy<lb/>
Spirit gives to some Persons, <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. lxxxii.6. <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 82.6">I have<lb/>
said that <normalised orig="ye" auto="false">you</normalised> are Gods, and that <normalised orig="ye" auto="false">you</normalised> are all the Children<lb/>
of the most High.</quote> And yet what follows immediately<lb/>
upon it? A Sad, but Certain Truth: <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 82.7">Nevertheless<lb/>
<normalised orig="ye" auto="false">you</normalised> shall Die like Men.</quote> This is the Conclusion<lb/>
of all; The Common End of the Greatest,<lb/>
as well as of the Meanest, Persons. Here they<lb/>
may seem to be a Sort of Gods upon Earth: May<lb/>
dispense the Fortunes of Men as they please; Set<lb/>
up, whom they will set up; and Pull down,<lb/>
whom they will pull down. They may be <normalised orig="Honour'd" auto="false">Honoured</normalised><lb/>
too as Such, by Those who know no Religion<lb/>
above their Interests; nor think any Divinity<lb/>
more worthy of their Regard, than Those who<lb/>
have in their power to promote them to Riches,<lb/>
and Honour, and Authority.<lb/>
But Death observes none of these Formalities.<lb/>
When that strikes, the Crowned Head falls as<lb/>
surely before it, as He who had not where to lay<lb/>
his Head, till the Grave afforded him a place for it.<lb/>
All the difference is, that as such Persons are exposed<lb/>
to more Dangers, and subject to Greater<lb/>
Hazards, than lesser Men; so are their Lives more<lb/>
                  <lb/>

Uncertain; and, generally Speaking, more Short<lb/>
too. A Cottage may, and oftentimes <normalised orig="do's" auto="false">does</normalised> afford<lb/>
us an Example of a Vigorous Old Age: But this<lb/>
is a Sight which the Palaces of Princes are seldom<lb/>
blessed with; nor can it reasonably be expected<lb/>
they should often Enjoy it.<lb/>
And when this is the Case, what a folly must it<lb/>
be to build our Hope upon such Protectors? Who<lb/>
are so far from being able to Help us, that alas!<lb/>
they are not able to Help themselves, in those<lb/>
Instances, in which both They and We, the most,<lb/>
stand in need of Assistance. Whose Breath is not<lb/>
their Own: <choice ana="print-error">

So foolish a thing is it, in point of Reason, to<lb/>
put our Trust in Man; be the Place, the Power, or<lb/>
Authority which he Enjoys, what it will. And<lb/>
for a yet more sensible confirmation of this Great<lb/>
Truth; give me leave, but briefly, to illustrate it<lb/>
to you, in that Fatal Evidence it has pleased God at<lb/>
this time to give us, in the Person of our late Royal<lb/>
<normalised orig="Soveraign" auto="false">Sovereign</normalised>, How little <normalised orig="dependance" auto="false">dependence</normalised> is to be placed upon<lb/>
any Human Support; upon the Best, or Greatest of<lb/>
the Children of Men.<lb/>
If, First, We consider Her with respect to her<lb/>
Power and Dignity; She was Queen of a Mighty and<lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
Renowned People: Endued with the Highest<lb/>
Authority that a Crown could give her; and in<lb/>
that with the largest Capacity that any Creature<lb/>
could pretend to, of Doing Good. Her Opportunities<lb/>
were Many, and her Advantages very Great<lb/>
for such a Purpose. Much was expected from<lb/>
Her; and we must, with Gratitude, Acknowledge,<lb/>
that much she did Do.<lb/>
For indeed, 2ly; Her Will was not at all Less, nay<lb/>
I may venture to say, it was much Greater than her<lb/>
Power. Nor did she value any thing so much in the<lb/>
Eminence of that Station to which it had pleased<lb/>
God to raise her amongst us; as that it put her<lb/>
in a Condition of extending the Exercise of her<lb/>
<normalised orig="Vertues" auto="false">Virtues</normalised> a great deal farther, than it had been possible<lb/>
for her to have done in a Lesser Fortune.<lb/>
Never was there Any in so High a Place,<lb/>
more free and <normalised orig="easie" auto="false">easy</normalised> of Access, even to the most<lb/>
Ordinary Persons: More Desirous to Oblige all, or<lb/>
that better knew how to Do it. <normalised orig="Insomuch" auto="true">Inasmuch</normalised> that I<lb/>
believe it has seldom been known that Any ever<lb/>
Applied to Her, but what have gone away <normalised orig="Easie" auto="false">Easy</normalised><lb/>
and Contented from Her: And either obtained<lb/>
what they wanted, or not known how to Complain,<lb/>
if they have not.<lb/>
The truth is, She was a Person in whom Nature<lb/>
and Grace seem to have <normalised orig="concurr'd" auto="false">concurred</normalised>, to make up<lb/>
One great Master-piece of Excellency and Perfection.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="10">B2</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
Her Natural Dispositon was Free and Generous;<lb/>
Open and Sincere. She had a Sweetness of Temper,<lb/>
<normalised orig="finish'd" auto="false">finished</normalised> and <normalised orig="heightned" auto="false">heightened</normalised> with a large mixture<lb/>
of Christian Charity and Compassion: Such as<lb/>
never loved to see any in Misery, Otherwise than<lb/>
as it gave her an Opportunity thereby of Doing<lb/>
somewhat for them to make them <normalised orig="Easie" auto="false">Easy</normalised>.<lb/>
Thus was she fitted to Do Good: And a singular<lb/>
Dexterity She had in the Doing of it. She<lb/>
knew What was fit to be done for Every One;<lb/>
and After what Manner; and At what Time. And<lb/>
seldom did She Vouchsafe a Favour to Any, but<lb/>
the very Way that she <normalised orig="bestow'd" auto="false">bestowed</normalised> it in, doubled<lb/>
the Obligation; and made a deeper Impression<lb/>
upon the Mind of Him who <normalised orig="receiv'd" auto="false">received</normalised> it, than the<lb/>
Benefit it self did.<lb/>
In short; So Great was her Comprehension;<lb/>
So Correct her Judgment; So <normalised orig="Easie" auto="false">Easy</normalised> her Dispatch,<lb/>
of whatever came before her; That God seemed<lb/>
to have fitted her Soul to her Place and Character:<lb/>
And to have given her a Capacity as far beyond<lb/>
that of Other Common Persons, as she was in<lb/>
Rank and Dignity above Them.<lb/>
Such good reason had we, upon All these accounts,<lb/>
to expect some more than Ordinary Blessings<lb/>
under her Government; and to put a greater<lb/>
Trust and Confidence in her, than was almost fit<lb/>
to be placed in any Creature. And the more to<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="11">10</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
encourage us so to do, it had pleased God to all<lb/>
his Other Endowments, to Add such a Vigour<lb/>
of Body, and Firmness of Constitution, as <normalised orig="seem'd" auto="false">seemed</normalised><lb/>
to Equal the Vivacity of her Mind: And promised<lb/>
us almost an Age of Happiness yet to come,<lb/>
under the Influence of her Conduct.<lb/>
And now, when so many Circumstances <normalised orig="concurr'd" auto="false">concurred</normalised><lb/>
to encourage our <normalised orig="Relyance" auto="false">Reliance</normalised> upon Her;<lb/>
who could Blame us for being willing to flatter<lb/>
Our Selves, that such a Queen was certainly raised<lb/>
up by God to do some extraordinary Good for<lb/>
that Church and Kingdom to which He had given<lb/>
Her? But alas! a Sad Experience has <normalised orig="shewn" auto="false">shown</normalised> us<lb/>
that we ought not to have put our Trust even in<lb/>
Such a Person. And if Such a Person may not<lb/>
be <normalised orig="rely'd" auto="false">relied</normalised> upon, We may then safely conclude,<lb/>
that We must look beyond this World for our<lb/>
Support: And not place our Confidence on any<lb/>
but that God who alone, both Can Do All things<lb/>
for us; and will continue, for ever, to Help and<lb/>
Defend Us.<lb/>
Which therefore brings me to the Other Point<lb/>
I proposed to speak to;<lb/>
Secondly, That he who will place his Trust<lb/>
upon a sure Foundation, must place it upon<lb/>
God; who alone is Able to Succour us in All<lb/>
our Exigencies, and will Always continue in<lb/>
a Capacity so to Do.<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="12">11</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
And 1st. That God is Able to Succour us in All<lb/>
our Exigencies; is evident from hence, that he<lb/>
is Able to do <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 135.6">whatsoever he pleases both in Heaven<lb/>
and Earth.</quote> That he has no Equal, much less<lb/>
any <normalised orig="Superiour" auto="false">Superior</normalised> Power, to <normalised orig="Controul" auto="false">Control</normalised> his Will;<lb/>
and to hinder him from bringing Whatsoever<lb/>
he purposes, to the End which he Designs.<lb/>
That as he is the first Being, and Author of<lb/>
all Others; So was there Nothing before him<lb/>
to Confine, or Limit his Perfections. He Received<lb/>
not his Power from Any; Nor has he<lb/>
therefore any Restraint upon it but what proceeds<lb/>
from himself, and is subject to his Own Will.<lb/>
Man, as he was Created by God, so was he<lb/>
limited too by him in his State and Condition,<lb/>
to a certain Degree of Perfection, beyond which<lb/>
he cannot Go, nor Raise up himself above it.<lb/>
And therefore, whatsoever Power he has, is confined<lb/>
within those Bounds which the Divine<lb/>
Wisdom has thought fit to set to it: Nor can<lb/>
he Go, the least Tittle, beyond what God has<lb/>
permitted him to Do.<lb/>
But God himself is Free and without Constraint.<lb/>
With him nothing is impossible, but<lb/>
what is Sinful; And that is not an Instance of<lb/>
true Power, but of <normalised orig="Impotency" auto="true">Impotence</normalised> and Infirmity.<lb/>
So that if we would then Trust in Man, we<lb/>
must do it with those Restrictions which his Nature<lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
requires us to limit <choice ana="print">
                     <sic>ou</sic>
                     <corr>our</corr>
                  </choice> Trust withal: And<lb/>
depend upon Him as One whose Power may fail;<lb/>
Whose Mind may Change; nay, whose very Life<lb/>
may be taken from him.<lb/>
But with God we shall need none of these Reserves.<lb/>
He is Absolutely Able, in Every thing, to<lb/>
Help and Succour us: And in all such Cases wherein<lb/>
it is fitting for Him to Do it, He will help us, if<lb/>
we do but duly apply our selves to Him, and depend<lb/>
upon Him. And when such is the Advantage of<lb/>
God, in this Respect, above Any of his Creatures;<lb/>
much more above Man, the Lowest of all the Rational<lb/>
Kind in Power and Dignity: Well may<lb/>
the Psalmist pronounce him Blessed, whose Wisdom<lb/>
and Piety have taught him to fix his<lb/>
Trust there, where Nothing can hinder it from<lb/>
being Beneficial to Him, but his own Neglecting<lb/>
to seek for Help as he ought to Do.<lb/>
I say nothing now of the many Other Arguments<lb/>
that might be offered to Encourage us in<lb/>
this Trust, and to <normalised orig="shew" auto="false">show</normalised> the Happiness of that Man<lb/>
who has placed his Hope upon it. Such are,<lb/>
The infinite Wisdom of God, in judging what is<lb/>
Best for Us, and after what Manner it will be<lb/>
most for our Interest to be Helped by him. His<lb/>
infinite Knowledge, for the Discovery of our Wants,<lb/>
oftentimes long before We Our selves are sensible<lb/>
of them. His Power to Relieve Us, not only<lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
in All our Exigencies, which I have before Observed;<lb/>
but to Do it in a Moment, at the very Minute<lb/>
that it will be most Seasonable for Us to have<lb/>
it done. And, not to mention any more; His<lb/>
Ability to Prevent Evils from Coming upon us, no<lb/>
less than to Free us from them, or to Support us under<lb/>
Them, when they have Overtaken Us. And<lb/>
in all which the Wisdom and Power of Man can<lb/>
either Do Nothing at all, or Nothing Comparable<lb/>
to what God is able to Do.<lb/>
But One Consideration more there is, which<lb/>
neither the express Words of my Text, nor the Occasion<lb/>
of the present Discourse, will permit me to<lb/>
pass by: And that is, 2dly. That God is not only<lb/>
thus Able, as I have <normalised orig="shewn" auto="false">shown</normalised>, to Help us in All our<lb/>
Needs; but will continue for Ever in a Capacity to<lb/>
save and defend Us. For God is Eternal in his<lb/>
Duration, as well as Infinite in his Power; and<lb/>
as He never had a Beginning of Being, so neither<lb/>
can He Ever Come to an End of it.<lb/>
Now how far this sets him up above all<lb/>
Earthly Benefactors, I have already <normalised orig="shewn" auto="false">shown</normalised> you;<lb/>
and the mighty Loss, we have just now <normalised orig="sustain'd" auto="false">sustained</normalised>,<lb/>
does but too plainly Declare.<lb/>
When One of our Earthly Benefactors Dies, not<lb/>
only all his Good Dispositions towards us perish<lb/>
together with Him, but all his Power too of putting<lb/>
them in Execution, from that instant, Ceases.<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="15">14</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
And we from thenceforth become as Destitute<lb/>
and <normalised orig="Forlorne" auto="true">Forlorn</normalised>, as if we had never had any such<lb/>
Friend or Patron, to rely upon. In such a Trust<lb/>
therefore there is no certainty: Nothing on<lb/>
which to build any lasting Hope: any wise and<lb/>
comfortable expectation.<lb/>
But God <normalised orig="endureth" auto="true">endures</normalised> for ever, and therefore his<lb/>
Help can never fail us. He will be our God unto<lb/>
Death; nay, and even after it too, will save and<lb/>
deliver Us. The Grave it self, which puts an<lb/>
end to all things else, cannot take us out of his<lb/>
hand, nor deprive us of his Protection. But in<lb/>
that melancholy Place and State, <normalised orig="tho'" auto="true">though</normalised> we know<lb/>
but little else of what relates to it; yet this we<lb/>
are sure of, that our Souls continue under his<lb/>
Care: And that, after a certain Period of time,<lb/>
our very Bodies themselves shall again be restored<lb/>
to us; and so we shall be for ever with the<lb/>
LORD.<lb/>
And thus I have <normalised orig="shewn" auto="false">shown</normalised> you, What the Advantages<lb/>
of that God are, above all Other Supporters,<lb/>
in whom our Text exhorts us to put our Trust;<lb/>
and pronounces Him Happy who has taken Care<lb/>
so to do. And when such are his Advantages<lb/>
above any of his Creatures, in this respect, as<lb/>
well as in All Others; What resolution can we<lb/>
better take up, than that which is pointed out to<lb/>
us in that Exhortation of the Evangelical Prophet,<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="16">C</fw>

Isai. 26.4. <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 26.4">Trust <normalised orig="ye" auto="false">you</normalised> in the LORD for ever;<lb/>
for in the LORD Jehovah is everlasting<lb/>
strength.</quote>
                  <lb/>
And this may suffice for the two Points I proposed<lb/>
to speak to: I shall only draw a few plain<lb/>
Consequences from what has been said, and so conclude<lb/>
this Discourse. And,<lb/>
First, Since such is the Vanity of putting our<lb/>
Trust in any Humane Help; let us resolve to<lb/>
take off our Hearts from all such Dependencies:<lb/>
And not build our Hope on such a Foundation, as<lb/>
we are sure in a little time will fail us, and we<lb/>
cannot tell how soon it may do so.<lb/>
I do not deny, but that as God orders the Affairs<lb/>
of Mankind by the Ministry of Second Causes;<lb/>
so we may, without incurring any just Censure<lb/>
for it, look to them as the Instruments which he<lb/>
makes use of in his Dispensations towards us.<lb/>
Nay, we may put some kind of Trust too in them:<lb/>
Provided that it goes no farther than the Nature<lb/>
of such Causes admits of; and that we still take<lb/>
care to look beyond them, to that God who employs<lb/>
them to our Interest and Advantage. But<lb/>
yet, when all is done, our last and highest <normalised orig="Dependance" auto="false">Dependence</normalised><lb/>
must be placed upon God only; who<lb/>
alone is Able, and will always be so, in all our<lb/>
Exigencies to Help and Deliver Us.<lb/>
It cannot be doubted but that We of this Country,<lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
and especially We of this Church, have indeed received<lb/>
as great a loss, as could well have <normalised orig="happen'd" auto="false">happened</normalised><lb/>
to us, in the unexpected Death of our late<lb/>
Royal Sovereign.<lb/>
A Princess she was, such as this Nation never<lb/>
before had, nor was it now worthy of her. To<lb/>
draw her Character, and set her out to you with<lb/>
all the Advantage that her real Worth deserves,<lb/>
is a Task too difficult for me to presume to attempt:<lb/>
Though this security I should have in the<lb/>
doing of it, that let me say what I could, no<lb/>
one would accuse me of Flattery in it; a Vice ever<lb/>
odious, and I think no where more so than in<lb/>
the Pulpit. For howsoever <normalised orig="'tis" auto="false">it is</normalised> impossible to<lb/>
speak of Her, and not say Great things; yet very<lb/>
hard it is to speak, but a small part, of what<lb/>
all must allow might justly be reported of Her.<lb/>
Let it suffice, at present, to say; That if a Queen<lb/>
so <normalised orig="Vertuous" auto="true">Virtuous</normalised>, that her very Example was enough<lb/>
to convert a Libertine, and to reform an Age:<lb/>
So Courteous and Affable, as to be the wonder and<lb/>
delight of All that Knew her: So great a Lover<lb/>
of her Country, and the Interests of it; as to be willing<lb/>
to hazard what, next her Conscience, she<lb/>
the most valued, her good Name, and good Opinion<lb/>
in the World, for the preservation of them:<lb/>
So firm and constant in her Mind, as not to have<lb/>
once known, no not in Death it self, what it was<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="18">C2</fw>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
to fear: So Happy in Business, as to astonish, rather<lb/>
than <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised>, those who were the best versed<lb/>
in it: I say, If to have been deprived of such a<lb/>
Queen as this; and that at such an Age, when our<lb/>
Expectations were at the highest from Her, be a<lb/>
loss above the power of Words to express; then<lb/>
such is our loss: The greatness of which<lb/>
we are so far from being able sufficiently to declare,<lb/>
that perhaps we cannot yet make a just<lb/>
Estimate of it.<lb/>
But yet, were we not hereby too much convinced,<lb/>
how little we ought to depend upon<lb/>
such kind of Helps; I might presume to say, to<lb/>
the Glory of God, and to our own Comfort,<lb/>
that we had still enough of these remaining, to<lb/>
suppress all disorderly Fears, and undue Repinings<lb/>
at that which we have lost.<lb/>
God has, <normalised orig="'tis" auto="false">it is</normalised> true, removed our Queen from<lb/>
us: But He still continues his Sacred Majesty to<lb/>
us, notwithstanding all the Dangers to which He<lb/>
has been exposed. He has deprived us of the<lb/>
Benefit of Her Conduct: But He has left us Him,<lb/>
under whom She herself grew up in that Wisdom<lb/>
and Courage, we so much admired in Her.<lb/>
And even beyond this, we have the Prospect<lb/>
of a yet farther Succession to fill the Throne; and<lb/>
to support the Interests both of the Church and<lb/>
State amongst us.<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="19">18</fw>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
But yet when all is done, <normalised orig="'tis" auto="false">it is</normalised> not upon these<lb/>
fair and promising Expectations that we must<lb/>
place our Trust, or account the Fortune of our<lb/>
<normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised> Welfare to depend: But it is that God, who<lb/>
has so long and wonderfully defended us, that<lb/>
must still be our Support; or all these Helps will<lb/>
<normalised orig="signifie" auto="true">signify</normalised> Nothing to us.<lb/>
Indeed these are the Persons by whom we<lb/>
justly may, and therefore accordingly do Hope to<lb/>
be Protected and Defended. And a singular <normalised orig="Hapness" auto="true">Happiness</normalised><lb/>
it is to us, that we have such a fair Succession<lb/>
of the Royal Family before our Eyes. But yet<lb/>
when all is done, <normalised orig="'tis" auto="false">it is</normalised> from the Blessing of God<lb/>
in preserving these Persons to us, and prospering<lb/>
their Endeavours, that we must look for safety:<lb/>
And God, even without any such Helps, could,<lb/>
if he pleased, secure and protect us. But,<lb/>
Secondly, As these Considerations should move<lb/>
us, not to put our Trust in any Humane Help; so<lb/>
should they keep us from being very much <normalised orig="surprized" auto="false">surprised</normalised>,<lb/>
if at any time such kind of Helps shall<lb/>
chance to fail us.<lb/>
It was a Great Expression, and argued a Worthy<lb/>
Mind, in Him <notvariant>anciently</notvariant>, who being told<lb/>
of the Death of his Son, <normalised orig="pass'd" auto="true">passed</normalised> it off with this<lb/>
only Reflection; That He always knew that He<lb/>
was Mortal.<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="20">19</fw>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
And the same should be our <choice ana="typeset-error">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr>Consideration</corr>
                  </choice> upon<lb/>
these Occasions. We know that all Humane<lb/>
Helps are Transitory and Uncertain: And why<lb/>
then should we stand amazed, as if some strange<lb/>
thing had <normalised orig="happen'd" auto="false">happened</normalised> to us, when we come to be<lb/>
Deprived of that, which we always knew we<lb/>
had no security of.<lb/>
I am not so unsensible of the loss we have<lb/>
now received, as not to think that we ought to<lb/>
pay a very just regret to it; and to consider seriously<lb/>
with our selves, for what Sins of this Nation<lb/>
especially it is, that God has taken away from<lb/>
us our Royal Defender. But yet I cannot think<lb/>
that it ought to be any great <normalised orig="Surprize" auto="true">Surprise</normalised> to us: Unless<lb/>
it be some new Calamity to see a Mortal<lb/>
Die, and to find that to have <normalised orig="happen'd" auto="false">happened</normalised> to One,<lb/>
which happens to Thousands every day.<lb/>
Nay, but Thirdly; We ought not only not to be<lb/>
<normalised orig="Surprized" auto="false">Surprised</normalised> at the failure of such kind of Helps, but<lb/>
neither should we be immoderately <normalised orig="Concern'd" auto="true">Concerned</normalised> and<lb/>
Cast down at it: Because God is never the less Able<lb/>
to preserve us for the loss of these, but can either<lb/>
raise us up New Supporters, or save us without Any,<lb/>
if He rather sees fit so to Do.<lb/>
I am verily persuaded that we have at this<lb/>
time received as sensible a Blow, in this respect,<lb/>
in the Loss of our Royal Sovereign, as could have<lb/>
befallen us in any One Life, excepting that of<lb/>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
His Sacred Majesty. But yet far be it from me<lb/>
so far to despond, or to distrust the Providence of<lb/>
God, as to think we must needs be ruined, because<lb/>
our Queen is taken from us. This were certainly<lb/>
to confine too much the Power of God, and to<lb/>
give too great an Advantage to our Enemies;<lb/>
who because they earnestly wish our <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised>, are<lb/>
therefore ready, upon every Occasion, to <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>fl*tter</sic>
                     <corr>flatter</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
themselves that the time is coming which they<lb/>
so much desire to see.<lb/>
But to <normalised orig="shew" auto="false">show</normalised> you how little Reason either we<lb/>
have to be rejected, or They to exalt their<lb/>
Hopes, on any such Account; Let us suppose the<lb/>
Case be as <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> as the most <normalised orig="Melancholly" auto="true">Melancholy</normalised> Mind<lb/>
can <normalised orig="fansie" auto="true">fancy</normalised>, or our most bitter Enemies could desire<lb/>
it to be. That we were indeed left Naked<lb/>
and Destitute of all Humane Help; and had no<lb/>
prospect remaining of any succour, much less<lb/>
had so good a one, as I have before <normalised orig="shewn" auto="false">shown</normalised>; and<lb/>
as it is evident to all the World that we have:<lb/>
Yet still I say that all this would not be enough<lb/>
to warrant us to Distrust God; but rather,<lb/>
Fourthly, We should then more especially rely<lb/>
upon his Help, when all other Supports do the<lb/>
most fail us.<lb/>
