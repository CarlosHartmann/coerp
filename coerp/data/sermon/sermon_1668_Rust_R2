GLorious things are spoken in Scripture<lb/>
concerning the future Reward<lb/>
of the Righteous; and all the<lb/>
words that are wont to <normalised orig="signifie" auto="true">signify</normalised><lb/>
what is of greatest Price and Value,<lb/>
or can represent the most enravishing<lb/>
objects of our desires are made use of by the<lb/>
Holy Ghost, to recommend unto us this transcendent<lb/>
State of Blessedness: Such are these;<lb/>
Rivers of pleasures, A fountain of living water,<lb/>
A treasure that can never be wasted, nor<lb/>
never taken from us; An inheritance in light,<lb/>
An incorruptible Crown, A Kingdom, The Kingdom<lb/>
of God, and the Kingdom of Christ; The<lb/>
Kingdom of Glory, A Crown of Glory and Life,<lb/>
and Righteousness, and Immortality; The Vision<lb/>
of God; Being <normalised orig="fill'd" auto="true">filled</normalised> with all the <normalised orig="fulness" auto="true">fullness</normalised> of<lb/>
God, An exceeding eternal weight of Glory,<lb/>
                  NoValue, Words<lb/>
strangely emphatical, that can't be put into<lb/>
English; and if they could, they would not be<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="2">A 2</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
able to convey to our minds the Notion that<lb/>
they design: for it is too big for any Expressions;<lb/>
and, after all that can be said, we must<lb/>
resolve with our Apostle, <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Jn 3.2">It does not yet appear<lb/>
what we shall be.</quote>
                  <lb/>
At this distance we cannot make any likely<lb/>
guesses or conjectures at the glory of that future<lb/>
state. Men make very imperfect descriptions<lb/>
of Countries or Cities, that never were there<lb/>
themselves, nor saw the Places with their<lb/>
own eyes. It is not for any mortal Creature<lb/>
to make a Map of that Canaan that lies above:<lb/>
It is to all us that live here on the hither-side<lb/>
of Death, an unknown <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised>, and an<lb/>
<normalised orig="undiscover'd" auto="true">undiscovered</normalised> Land. It may be, some heavenly<lb/>
Pilgrim, that with his holy thoughts and ardent<lb/>
desires, is continually travelling thitherward,<lb/>
he arrives sometimes near the borders<lb/>
of the <normalised orig="promis'd" auto="true">promised</normalised> Land, and the Suburbs of the<lb/>
new Jerusalem, and gets upon the top of Pisgah,<lb/>
and there he has an imperfect Prospect of<lb/>
a brave <normalised orig="Countrey" auto="true">Country</normalised>, that lies <choice ana="print-error">
                     <sic>afar</sic>
                     <corr>a far</corr>
                  </choice> way off; but he<lb/>
can't tell how to describe it, and all that he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised><lb/>
to say, to <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised> the curious Enquirer, is only<lb/>
this, If he would know the glories of it, he<lb/>
must go and see it. It was <normalised orig="believ'd" auto="true">believed</normalised> of old, that<lb/>
those places that lie under the Line, were<lb/>
burnt up by the continual heat of the Sun,<lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
and were not habitable, either by man or beast:<lb/>
But later Discoveries tell us, that there are the<lb/>
most pleasant Countries that the Earth can<lb/>
<normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised>; <normalised orig="insomuch" auto="true">inasmuch</normalised> that some have <normalised orig="plac'd" auto="true">placed</normalised> Paradise<lb/>
it self in that Climate. Sure I am, of all<lb/>
the Regions of the Intellectual world, and the<lb/>
several Lands that are peopled, either with<lb/>
Men or Angels, the most pleasant Countries<lb/>
they lie under the Line, under the direct<lb/>
beams of the Sun of Righteousness, where<lb/>
there is an eternal Day, and an eternal Spring;<lb/>
where is that Tree of Life, that <normalised orig="beareth" auto="true">bears</normalised> twelve<lb/>
manner of Fruits, and <normalised orig="yieldeth" auto="true">yields</normalised> her Fruit every<lb/>
Month: Thus we may use Figures, and Metaphors,<lb/>
and Allegories, and tell you of fruitful<lb/>
meads, and spacious fields, and winding<lb/>
rivers, and purling brooks, and chanting<lb/>
birds, and shady groves, and pleasant gardens,<lb/>
and lovely bowers, and noble Seats, and stately<lb/>
Palaces, and goodly People, and excellent<lb/>
Laws, and sweet Societies; but this is but to<lb/>
frame little comparisons to please our childish<lb/>
fancies: and just such discourses as a blind man<lb/>
would make concerning Colours; so do we<lb/>
talk of those things we never saw; and disparage<lb/>
the state whilst we would recommend it.<lb/>
Indeed it requires some Saint or Angel from<lb/>
Heaven to discourse upon this Subject; and<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="4">A 3</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
yet that would not do neither: for though<lb/>
they might be able to speak some thing of it,<lb/>
yet we should want ears to hear it. Neither<lb/>
can those things be <normalised orig="declar'd" auto="true">declared</normalised> but in the language<lb/>
of Heaven, which would be little understood<lb/>
by us, the poor inhabitants of this<lb/>
lower world; they are indeed things too great<lb/>
to be brought within the compass of words.<lb/>
Saint Paul, when he had been rapt up into the<lb/>
third Heaven, he saw NoValue, things unlawful,<lb/>
or unpossible to be uttered; and, <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 2.9">Eye<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not seen, nor ear heard, nor can it enter into<lb/>
the heart of man to conceive, what God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised><lb/>
prepared for them that love him</quote>; and, <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Jn 3.2">It does not<lb/>
yet appear what we shall be</quote>, said that beloved<lb/>
Disciple, that lay in the bosom of our Saviour.<lb/>
You will not now expect, that I should give<lb/>
you a relation of that which cannot be uttered,<lb/>
nor so much as <normalised orig="conceiv'd" auto="true">conceived</normalised>; or declare unto<lb/>
you what our Eagle-sighted Evangelist tells us<lb/>
does not yet appear: But, that you may understand,<lb/>
that that which sets this state of happiness<lb/>
so beyond the reach of all imagination, is<lb/>
only its transcendent excellency; I shall tell<lb/>
you something of what does already appear of<lb/>
it, and may be known concerning it.<lb/>
First of all we are <normalised orig="assur'd" auto="true">assured</normalised> that we shall then<lb/>
be freed from all the evils and miseries that we<lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
now labour under: Vanity and Misery they<lb/>
are two words that speak the whole of this<lb/>
present world; the enjoyments of it are<lb/>
dreams and fancies, and shadows, and appearances;<lb/>
and, if any thing be, it is only Evil and<lb/>
Misery that is real and substantial. Vanity<lb/>
and folly, labour and pains, cares and fears,<lb/>
crosses and disappointments, sickness and diseases,<lb/>
they make up the whole of our portion<lb/>
here. This life it is begun in a Cry, and it<lb/>
ends in a Groan; and he that lives most happily,<lb/>
his life is <normalised orig="checker'd" auto="true">checkered</normalised> with black and white,<lb/>
and his <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> are not all Sun-shine, but some<lb/>
are cloudy and gloomy, and there is a Worm<lb/>
at the root of all his joy, that soon eats out<lb/>
the sap and heart of it; and the goard in whose<lb/>
shade he now so much pleases himself, by to<lb/>
morrow will be <normalised orig="wither'd" auto="true">withered</normalised> and gone. But<lb/>
Heaven is not subject to these mixtures and<lb/>
uncertainties; it is a Region of calmness and<lb/>
serenity, and the Soul is there gotten above<lb/>
the clouds, and is not annoyed with those<lb/>
storms and tempests that are here below. All<lb/>
tears shall then be <normalised orig="wip'd" auto="true">wiped</normalised> from our eyes; and<lb/>
though sorrow may endure for the night of<lb/>
this World, yet joy will spring up in the<lb/>
morning of Eternity.<lb/>
We are sure we shall be freed from this<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="6">5</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
earthly, and <normalised orig="cloath'd" auto="true">clothed</normalised> with an heavenly and<lb/>
glorified Body. These bodies of ours they are<lb/>
the graves and sepulchres, the prisons and<lb/>
dungeons of our Heaven-born souls; and<lb/>
though we deck and adorn them, and pride<lb/>
our selves in their beauty and comeliness, yet,<lb/>
when all is done, they are but sinks of corruption<lb/>
and defilement: they expose us to many<lb/>
pains and diseases, and incline us to many<lb/>
lusts and passions, and the more we pamper<lb/>
them, the greater burden they are unto our<lb/>
minds; they impose upon our reasons, and by<lb/>
their steams and vapours cast a mist before our<lb/>
understandings; they clog our affections, and<lb/>
like a <normalised orig="heavie" auto="true">heavy</normalised> weight depress us unto this earth,<lb/>
and keep us from soaring aloft among the<lb/>
winged Inhabitants of the upper-Regions: But<lb/>
those robes of light and glory, which we shall<lb/>
be <normalised orig="cloath'd" auto="true">clothed</normalised> <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised> at the Resurrection of the<lb/>
Just, and those Heavenly Bodies which the<lb/>
Gospel <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> then <normalised orig="assur'd" auto="true">assured</normalised> unto us, they are not<lb/>
subject to any of these mischiefs and inconveniences,<lb/>
but are fit and accommodate instruments<lb/>
for the soul in its highest exaltations.<lb/>
And this is an argument that the Gospel does<lb/>
dwell much upon, viz. the Redemption of<lb/>
our bodies, that <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 3.21">He shall change our vile bodies,<lb/>
that they may be like unto His glorious body</quote>;<lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
and we are taught to look upon it as one great<lb/>
price of our Reward, that we shall be <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Cor 5.2"><normalised orig="cloath'd" auto="true">clothed</normalised><lb/>
upon with our house which is from heaven</quote>; that<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 15.54">this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and<lb/>
this mortal immortality</quote>: that, <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Cor 15.49">as we have born<lb/>
the image of the earthly, so we must bear the<lb/>
image of the heavenly Adam</quote>, who was NoValue,<lb/>
of heaven heavenly; as the first man was,<lb/>
                  NoValue, of the earth earthy. And therefore,<lb/>
I think, the Schools put too mean a Rate upon<lb/>
this great Promise of the Gospel, The Resurrection<lb/>
of our bodies; and, I believe, it might<lb/>
be demonstrated from the principles of sound<lb/>
Philosophy, That this Article of our Christian<lb/>
Faith, which the Atheist makes so much sport<lb/>
<normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>, is so far from being chargeable with<lb/>
any absurdity, that it is founded upon the<lb/>
highest Reason; for, seeing we find by too great<lb/>
an experience, that the Soul has so close and necessary<lb/>
a dependence upon this gross and<lb/>
earthly Mass that we now carry about with us;<lb/>
it may be disputed with some probability, whether<lb/>
it be ever able to act independently of all<lb/>
matter whatsoever: at least, we are <normalised orig="assur'd" auto="true">assured</normalised>, that<lb/>
the state of conjunction is most connatural to<lb/>
her; and that, Intellectual pleasure it self is<lb/>
not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> multiplied, but the better felt, by<lb/>
its redundancy upon the body and spirits: and<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="8">B</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
if it be so, then the purer and more defecate<lb/>
the Body is, the better will the Soul be appointed<lb/>
for the exercise of its noblest operations;<lb/>
and it will be no mean piece of our<lb/>
reward hereafter, that that which is sown<lb/>
                  NoValue, an animal, shall be raised a heavenly<lb/>
body.<lb/>
We are sure, that we shall then be free from<lb/>
sin, and all those foolish lusts and passions that<lb/>
we are now enslaved unto. The life of a Christian,<lb/>
it is a continual Warfare; and he endures<lb/>
many sore conflicts, and makes many sad<lb/>
complaints, and often bemoans himself after<lb/>
such a manner, as this: <normalised orig="Wo" auto="true">Woe</normalised> is me, that I am<lb/>
<normalised orig="forc'd" auto="true">forced</normalised> to dwell in Mesech, and to have my habitation<lb/>
in the Tents of Kedar; that there<lb/>
should be so many Goliah's within me, that <normalised orig="defie" auto="true">defy</normalised><lb/>
the host of Israel; so many sons of Anak<lb/>
that hinder my entrance into the Land of Promise,<lb/>
and the Rest of God; that I should toil<lb/>
and labour among the bricks, and live in bondage<lb/>
unto these worse than Egyptian Task-Masters.<lb/>
Thus does he sit down by the Rivers of<lb/>
Babylon, and weep over those <normalised orig="ruines" auto="true">ruins</normalised> and desolations<lb/>
that these worse than Assyrian Armies<lb/>
have made in the City, and House of his God.<lb/>
And many a time does he cry out in the bitterness<lb/>
of his soul, <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 7.24">Wretched creature that I am!<lb/>
                     <pb n="9"/>
                     <lb/>
Who shall deliver me from this body of death?</quote>
                  <lb/>
And though, through his faith, and courage, and<lb/>
constancy, he be daily getting ground of his<lb/>
spiritual enemies, yet it is but by inches, and<lb/>
every step he takes, he must fight for it; and<lb/>
living as he does in an Enemies <normalised orig="countrey" auto="true">country</normalised>, he is<lb/>
<normalised orig="forc'd" auto="true">forced</normalised> <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> to be upon his Guard; and if he<lb/>
slumber never so little, presently he is <normalised orig="surpriz'd" auto="true">surprised</normalised><lb/>
by a watchful Adversary. This is our portion<lb/>
here, and our lot is this; but when we arrive<lb/>
unto those Regions of bliss and glory that are<lb/>
above, we shall then stand safely upon the<lb/>
shore, and see all our enemies, Pharaoh and<lb/>
all his host, <normalised orig="drown'd" auto="true">drowned</normalised> and destroyed in the Red<lb/>
Sea; and being delivered from the World, and<lb/>
the Flesh, and the Devil, Death, and Sin, and<lb/>
Hell, we shall sing the Song of Moses, and of<lb/>
the Lamb, an Epinicion, and Song of eternal<lb/>
triumph unto the God of our Salvation.<lb/>
We shall be sure to meet with the best company<lb/>
that Earth or Heaven affords: Good<lb/>
company it is the great pleasure of the life of<lb/>
man; And we shall then come <quote type="biblical" ana="Heb 12.22-24">to the innumerable<lb/>
company of Angles, and the general Assembly<lb/>
of the Church of the First-born, and to the<lb/>
Spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus<lb/>

                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
O that blessed day, when we shall make<lb/>
our escape from this <normalised orig="medly" auto="true">medley</normalised> and confused riot, and<lb/>
shall arrive to that great Council and general<lb/>
<normalised orig="Randevouz" auto="true">Rendezvous</normalised> of divine and godlike Spirits!<lb/>
But, which is more than all, we shall then<lb/>
meet our Lord Jesus Christ, the Head of our<lb/>
Recovery, whose story is now so delightful<lb/>
unto us, as reporting nothing of him, but<lb/>
the greatest sweetness and innocence, and<lb/>
meekness and patience, and mercy and tenderness,<lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
and benignity and goodness, and what<lb/>
ever can render any person lovely or amiable;<lb/>
and who out of his dear love and deep compassion<lb/>
unto mankind, gave up himself unto<lb/>
the death for us men, and for our salvation.<lb/>
And if St. Augustine made it one of his wishes,<lb/>
to have seen Jesus Christ in the flesh; how<lb/>
much more desirable is it, to see him out of his<lb/>
terrestrial weeds, in his robes of Glory, with<lb/>
all his redeemed Ones about him! And this I<lb/>
cannot but look upon, as a great advantage and<lb/>
<normalised orig="priviledge" auto="true">privilege</normalised>, of that future State; for I am not<lb/>
apt to swallow down that Conceit of the<lb/>

<normalised orig="Vice-gerent" auto="false">Vicegerent</normalised> in the World, and the Head and<lb/>
<normalised orig="Governour" auto="true">Governor</normalised> of the whole Creation. In this<lb/>
our narrow and contacted state we are apt<lb/>
to think too meanly of our selves, and do not<lb/>
understand the dignity of our own natures,<lb/>
what we were made for, and what we are capable<lb/>
of: but, as Plotinus somewhere observes,<lb/>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
We are like Children, from our birth brought<lb/>
up in ignorance of, and at a great distance<lb/>
from, our Parents and Relations; and have forgot<lb/>
the Nobleness of our Extraction, and rank<lb/>
our selves and our fortunes among the Lot of<lb/>
<normalised orig="Beggers" auto="true">Beggars</normalised>, and mean and ordinary persons;<lb/>
though we are the off-spring of a great Prince,<lb/>
and were born to a Kingdom. It does indeed<lb/>
become creatures to think modestly of themselves;<lb/>
yet, if we consider it aright, it will be<lb/>
found very hard, to set any bounds or limits<lb/>
to our own happiness, and say, Hitherto it<lb/>
shall arise, and no further. For that wherein<lb/>
the happiness of Man consists, viz. Truth<lb/>
and Goodness, and Communication of the Divine<lb/>
Nature, and the <normalised orig="Illapses" auto="true">Ellipses</normalised> of Divine Love,<lb/>
it does not cloy, or glut, or satiate; but every<lb/>
participation of them does widen and enlarge<lb/>
our Souls, and fits us for further and<lb/>
further Receptions; the more we have, the<lb/>
more we are capable of; the more we are<lb/>
<normalised orig="fill'd" auto="true">filled</normalised>, the more room is made in our Spirits;<lb/>
and thus it is still and still, even till we arrive<lb/>
unto such degrees as we can assign no measures<lb/>

We shall then be made like unto God<lb/>
                  NoValue; said<lb/>

does not yet appear what we shall be, but when<lb/>
he shall appear, we shall be like him</quote>, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> our<lb/>
Evangelist; for <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Jn 3.2">we shall see him as he is.</quote> There<lb/>
is no seeing God as he is, but by becoming like<lb/>
unto him; nor is there any enjoying of him,<lb/>
but by being <normalised orig="transform'd" auto="true">transformed</normalised> into his Image and<lb/>
<normalised orig="Similitude" auto="true">Simulated</normalised>. Men usually have very strange<lb/>
Notions concerning God, and the enjoyment<lb/>
of him; or rather, these are words, to which<lb/>
there is no correspondent conception in their<lb/>
minds: but if we would understand God aright,<lb/>
we must look upon him as Infinite Wisdom,<lb/>
Righteousness, Love, Goodness, and<lb/>
whatever speaks any thing of Beauty and Perfection;<lb/>
and if we pretend to worship him,<lb/>
it must be by loving and adoring his transcendent<lb/>
Excellencies; and if we hope to enjoy<lb/>
him, it must be by conformity unto him, and<lb/>
participation of his Nature. The frame and<lb/>
constitution of things is such, that it is impossible<lb/>
that Man should arrive to Happiness any<lb/>
other way. And if the <normalised orig="Soveraignty" auto="true">Sovereignty</normalised> of God<lb/>
should dispense with our obedience, the nature<lb/>
of the thing would not permit us to be<lb/>
happy without it: If we live only the Animal<lb/>
Life, we may indeed be happy, as Beasts are<lb/>
happy; but the Happiness that belongs to a<lb/>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
Rational and intellectual Being, can never be<lb/>
<normalised orig="attain'd" auto="true">attained</normalised> but in a way of holiness and conformity<lb/>
unto the Divine Will: for, such a temper<lb/>
and disposition of mind is necessary unto Happiness,<lb/>
not by <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> of any arbitrarious constitution<lb/>
of Heaven; but, the eternal Laws of<lb/>
Righteousness, and immutable respects of<lb/>
things, do require and exact it: Yea, I may truly<lb/>
say, That God and Christ without us cannot<lb/>
make us happy: for we are not conscious to<lb/>
our selves of any thing, but only the operations<lb/>
of our own minds; &amp; <normalised orig="tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> not the person of God<lb/>
and Christ, but their Life and Nature, wherein<lb/>
consists our formal happiness: For, What is<lb/>
the happiness of God himself, but only that<lb/>
pleasure and satisfaction that results from a<lb/>
sense of his Infinite perfections? And how is it<lb/>
possible for a creature to be more happy, than<lb/>
by partaking of that, in its measure and proportion,<lb/>
which is the happiness of God himself.<lb/>
The Soul being thus <normalised orig="prepar'd" auto="true">prepared</normalised>, shall live in<lb/>
the presence of God, and lie under the influences<lb/>

For now there is nothing can hinder the most<lb/>

their parts can never run up into one another.<lb/>
But there is no such NoValue, or resistance, amongst<lb/>

from God (NoValue) not by distance<lb/>

of Nature; and when that is <normalised orig="remov'd" auto="true">removed</normalised>, He<lb/>

                  <lb/>
purgation to illumination, and so to Union.<lb/>
There are several faculties in the Soul of Man,<lb/>
that are conformed to several kinds of objects;<lb/>
and, according to that Life a Man is <normalised orig="awaked" auto="true">awoke</normalised> into,<lb/>
so these faculties do exert themselves; and<lb/>
though whilst we live barely an Animal Life,<lb/>
we converse with little more than this outward<lb/>
World, and the objects of our Senses; yet<lb/>
there are Faculties within us that are receptive<lb/>
of God, and when we arrive once unto a due<lb/>
measure of purity of Spirit, the <normalised orig="Rayes" auto="true">Rays</normalised> of Heavenly<lb/>
Light will as certainly shine into our<lb/>
minds, as the beams of the Sun, when it arises<lb/>
above the Horizon, do illuminate the clear<lb/>
and pellucid air: And from this sight and illumination,<lb/>
the Soul proceeds to an intimate<lb/>
union with God, and to a <normalised orig="tast" auto="true">taste</normalised> and touch of him.<lb/>
This is that NoValue, that silent touch<lb/>
with God that fills the Soul with unexpressible<lb/>
joy and triumph: For, if the objects of<lb/>
this outward world that strike upon our senses<lb/>
do so hugely please and delight us; What<lb/>
infinite pleasure then must there needs be in<lb/>
those touches and Impresses, that the Divine<lb/>
Love and goodness shall make upon our Souls?<lb/>
But these are things that we may talk of, as we<lb/>
would do of a sixth Sense, or something we<lb/>
have no distinct Notion or Idea of; but the perfect<lb/>

Lastly, we shall have our Knowledge, and<lb/>

their noblest objects in their most exalted Measures;<lb/>
For a Man to resolve himself in some<lb/>

that is, to represent unto you, how transcendently<lb/>

and that we cannot so much as guess<lb/>

burnt Offering, and all the substance of our<lb/>
Souls be <normalised orig="consum'd" auto="true">consumed</normalised> by fire from Heaven, and<lb/>
ascend up in Clouds of Incense! That as so<lb/>
many sparks we might be always mounting<lb/>
upward, till we return again into our proper<lb/>
Elements! That like so many particular Rivulets,<lb/>
we may be continually making toward<lb/>
the Sea, and never rest till we lose our<lb/>
selves in that Ocean of Goodness, from<lb/>
whence we first came! That we may open<lb/>
our Mouths wide, that God may <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised> them!<lb/>
That we may so perfectly discharge our selves<lb/>
of all strange Desires and Passions, that our<lb/>
Souls may be nothing else but a deep Emptiness,<lb/>
and vast Capacity to be <normalised orig="fill'd" auto="true">filled</normalised> with<lb/>
all the <normalised orig="fulness" auto="true">fullness</normalised> of God! Let but these be the<lb/>
breathings of our Spirits, and this Divine<lb/>
Magnetism will most certainly draw down<lb/>
God into our Souls, and we shall have some<lb/>
Prælibations of that Happiness; some small<lb/>
glimpses, and little discoveries whereof, is all<lb/>
that belongs to this state of Mortality.<lb/>
