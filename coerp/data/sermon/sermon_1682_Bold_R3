That the following part of my Discourse may be as plain and<lb/>
easy to you as possible, I will reduce what I design to say on this<lb/>
Subject, to these following Heads. 1. I will tell you what Persecution<lb/>
is. 2. Name more particularly the Characters of them<lb/>
that are Persecutors. 3. <normalised orig="Shew" auto="true">Show</normalised> you whence it is that wicked Men<lb/>
are so violently set against the Godly. 4. I will make some brief<lb/>
application of the whole.<lb/>
I am first of all to tell you what Persecution is. And it is an<lb/>
endeavouring to Trouble, Molest, Disturb, Kill, or any way Hurt<lb/>
and Injure another Person on some Religious account. Every<lb/>
Prosecution of a Person, is not properly Persecution, but only<lb/>
when it is grounded on some Religious Affair. A Man may be<lb/>
guilty of Sin in prosecuting another upon civil accounts, but this<lb/>
Sin comes under another Denomination, as Oppression, Injustice,<lb/>
unpeacable Brangling, &amp;c. Now Persecution is <choice ana="print">
                     <sic>muchwhat</sic>
                     <corr>much what</corr>
                  </choice> the<lb/>
same in Religion, that Oppression is in Civils. When Men will<lb/>
not suffer others to enjoy that Liberty, and those Rights in Religion,<lb/>
which either Nature or Revelation do allow them; but will<lb/>
be severe against them, if in every accidental Matter, they will<lb/>
not be just of their Mind. When Men do hale others to Tribunals,<lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
and procure them either to be Punished in their Bodies, or<lb/>
in their Estates; or to be deprived of their Lives, or civil<lb/>
Liberties, because they either perform some Duty God has <normalised orig="expresly" auto="true">expressly</normalised><lb/>
Commanded, in a way they do not approve, or because<lb/>
they will not consent to, Embrace, and Comply with those Determinations<lb/>
they have just reason to Believe are Sinful. Whilst<lb/>
Men are not openly Wicked, but tho not free from common Infirmities,<lb/>
which do unavoidably accompany humane Nature in<lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*his</sic>
                     <corr>this</corr>
                  </choice> frail Estate, yet free from Gross and Scandalous Sins, whilst<lb/>
they deny not any Doctrine of Christianity, nor divulge any Tenet<lb/>
to the Prejudice of Christianity, nor do any way endeavour<lb/>
to disturb the Peace of the Government under which they live;<lb/>
they have a right to a <normalised orig="peacable" auto="true">peaceable</normalised> and quiet Residence, and ought<lb/>
to be free from any Molestation, tho they cannot in every accidental<lb/>
thing attain to the same Latitude with others. Whoever<lb/>
goes about to Disturb and Injure, or Contract on such as these,<lb/>
Fines, or other Punishments, because they cannot receive and comply<lb/>
with those supernumerary Conceits some do too much please<lb/>
themselves with, and press with too much warmth on others, are<lb/>
too <normalised orig="lyable" auto="true">liable</normalised> to this heavy Charge of Persecution. And if we only<lb/>
consider what it is they are so concerned for, we may see too<lb/>
much reason, to conclude they have no great Portion of Commendable<lb/>
Properties. Wherefore I will now proceed to the<lb/>
Second Point, which is to account to you some of their Characters<lb/>
more particularly, or to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> you what kind of People Persecutors<lb/>
generally are. They are commonly observed to be the<lb/>
worst, the most Brutish, and Degenerate part of Mankind. Consult<lb/>
others, Read Histories, or Consider what you may Learn<lb/>
from your own Observation; you will find them to come generally<lb/>
under some very Scandalous, and Offensive Characters. They<lb/>
are usually taken to be the very Pest of Society. It is almost as<lb/>
dangerous to live amongst them, as amongst the Wild and Savage<lb/>
Beasts of the Desert. They are a sort of <normalised orig="Tygers" auto="true">Tigers</normalised> and Lions,<lb/>
the most Ravenous beasts of Prey with humane Visages.<lb/>
Were the Pythagorian Notion of the Transmigration of Souls<lb/>
received, the whole World would then conclude them nothing<lb/>
but humane Carcases acted with Wolvish Breath. More particularly<lb/>
they have some or all of these Characters and Qualities<lb/>
attending them.<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
1. They are Men of a very Superstitious, Blind and Ignorant<lb/>
Zeal. And there is no one thing that makes Men more formidable<lb/>
and <normalised orig="Troublesom" auto="true">Troublesome</normalised>, than undue and mistaken Zeal. It is like<lb/>
Fire when it meets with Gunpowder and other combustible Matter.<lb/>
It devours all before it, and its Flames become unquenchable.<lb/>
Superstitious Bigots place Religion in things, that are at<lb/>
best but bare humane Inventions, many times, pure Diabolical<lb/>
Suggestions; and then <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> to <normalised orig="ingulfe" auto="false">engulf</normalised> them further, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> so<lb/>
excite and irritate them, they contend and strive for these things,<lb/>
as if Heaven, Soul, and Eternity were all at Stake; hence it is,<lb/>
they represent all that are not of their Way and Mind, as the<lb/>
greatest Criminals and Malefactors. No sooner do Men place<lb/>
Religion where God <normalised orig="placeth" auto="true">places</normalised> none, but <normalised orig="Sathan" auto="true">Satan</normalised> obtains a great<lb/>
Power and Influence over them, and at last hurries them headlong<lb/>
into strange and wild Extravagancies in the Defence, and<lb/>
for the Propagation of those Points. These are usually the most<lb/>
fierce and barbarous of all other people. For it is usually observed<lb/>
that Superstitious Men are very Fearful, and that the greatest<lb/>
Cowards are most <normalised orig="Revengful" auto="true">Revengeful</normalised> and Cruel, if they can obtain an<lb/>
Advantage. Paul's blind Zeal made him a Persecutor: He did<lb/>
it Ignorantly. And our Saviour tells us of some that would kill<lb/>
and murder Men, and flatter themselves with a <normalised orig="Perswasion" auto="true">Persuasion</normalised> that<lb/>
they were therein doing God and Religion good Service.<lb/>
2. They are Men of insufferable Pride and Malice, there is<lb/>
an absolute Necessity, that some degree of that Popish Conceit<lb/>
of Infallibility should prevail in all that are Persecutors, to reconcile<lb/>
themselves to their own Practices; For who can be so absurd<lb/>
and foolish, as to endeavour to <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised> others, because they<lb/>
will not Believe or Practise what they themselves do <normalised orig="acknowledg" auto="true">acknowledge</normalised>,<lb/>
they are not so certain concerning, but that it is possible they may<lb/>
be in an <normalised orig="Errour" auto="true">Error</normalised> and Mistake? Those who are Persecutors do expect<lb/>
all should yield to them, and take them for Oracles, and<lb/>
if they be not thus received, they think the Affront is too great<lb/>
to be endured, and therefore must be Revenged. Malice and Revenge<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> generally a very great Influence on all Persecutions.<lb/>
Your Persecutors are usually People, of a Haughty, <normalised orig="Curst" auto="true">Cursed</normalised>, and<lb/>
Poisonous Nature, they love to be doing Evil: Their Delight<lb/>
is to Hurt and Offend them, with whom God is Pleased. They are<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="9">8</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="canker'd" auto="true">cankered</normalised> and ill natured, and never pleased but when they have<lb/>
an opportunity to <normalised orig="intrap" auto="true">entrap</normalised>, and make the Innocent fall. They<lb/>
cannot bear Contradiction. Zedekiah was so impatient of Contradiction,<lb/>
he no sooner hears Micaiah bring a different Message<lb/>
from his, and discover how a lying Spirit was in the Mouths of<lb/>
the other Prophets, but he falls upon Micaiah, and Buffets<lb/>
him.<lb/>
3. They are Men of desperate and broken Fortunes, or else<lb/>
great Worshippers of Mammon. They do commonly take up<lb/>
Informing, and Swearing, and Persecuting as a Trade to live by.<lb/>
They scarce know how to subsist but by Preying on the Wealth,<lb/>
and Estates, and Goods, of those honest, sober, religious People<lb/>
they do Inform and Swear against. Men that are so lazy they<lb/>
cannot Work, so luxurious they have not where withal to maintain<lb/>
their Lusts, and of so ill and blasted a Fame and Reputation,<lb/>
none dares trust them. These are indeed a fit sort of People<lb/>
to Persecute the Righteous: They cannot Live unless some<lb/>
or other fall by their means. There are two sorts of most abominable<lb/>
and wicked Ways, Men have found out to maintain<lb/>
themselves, and feed their Lusts by: The one is Robbing on the<lb/>
High-way, and the other is Informing against, and Persecuting<lb/>
the Righteous. Now those that apply to the latter Way, are<lb/>
the most Infamous of the two; for as they are wicked enough,<lb/>
to commit as great <normalised orig="Villanies" auto="true">Villainies</normalised> as the other dares, so they have not<lb/>
Courage to adventure on such dangerous Courses, and to expose<lb/>
themselves to so much Hazard for a <normalised orig="Livelyhood" auto="true">Livelihood</normalised> as the other do.<lb/>
They think it easier to Swear, than Hector and <normalised orig="afright" auto="true">affright</normalised> Men out<lb/>
of what they have. The wise Man seems to give a very lively<lb/>
Description of these People in Prov. 4.16, 17. <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 4.16">They sleep not<lb/>
except they have done Mischief, and their sleep is taken away, unless<lb/>
they cause some to fall</quote>, <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 4.17">for they eat the Bread of Wickedness, and drink<lb/>
the Wine of Violence.</quote>
                  <lb/>
If there be any Persecutors whose Fortunes are not altogether<lb/>
so despicable and small, they are such as make a Mammon<lb/>
their God; The Hopes of getting Wealth <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> very powerfully<lb/>
irritate them to what they do: Was it not thirty pieces of Silver<lb/>
that made Judas betray his Master? What is the Reason<lb/>
Sinners do excite one another to <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 1.11">wait for Blood, and to lurk privily<lb/>
                     <lb/>
                     <fw type="pageNum" n="10">C</fw>
                     <pb n="4"/>
                     <lb/>
for the Innocent without Cause?</quote> Is it not because <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 1.13">they hope they<lb/>
shall find all precious Substance, and shall fill their Houses with<lb/>
Spoil?</quote>
                  <lb/>
4. They are <normalised orig="extreamly" auto="true">extremely</normalised> profligate and scandalous in their Lives.<lb/>
Men that are very loose, <normalised orig="prophane" auto="true">profane</normalised>, and every way debauched:<lb/>
Such as are common Swearers, Drunkards, Whoremongers, and<lb/>
professed Enemies to every thing that is Serious, Holy, and Good.<lb/>
Men that have prostituted themselves to every Lust and Wickedness,<lb/>
that have no more of Religion than an outward Name,<lb/>
being Atheists in their Hearts, and many times so in their Profession.<lb/>
Such as think there is no Happiness but what agrees<lb/>
with Epicurus's Conceit, making their Belly their God, and minding<lb/>
nothing but the things of this World. Your ordinary forsworn,<lb/>
and <normalised orig="perjur'd" auto="true">perjured</normalised> Wretches, are the People that do most commonly<lb/>
seek a <normalised orig="Livelyhood" auto="true">Livelihood</normalised> by being <normalised orig="suborn'd" auto="true">suborned</normalised> to Swear against them<lb/>
that fear the Lord. They that never scruple to tear the name of<lb/>
God in Pieces, and to affront their Maker on every turn, by taking<lb/>
his Name in Vain, who emboss every Word they speak, with<lb/>
some dreadful Oath or other, who dare impudently swear a hundred<lb/>
Oaths in an Hour, without any Provocation, these are the<lb/>
fittest Men to Inform and Swear against, and endeavour their <normalised orig="Ruine" auto="true">Ruin</normalised>,<lb/>
who have a Religious and truly Conscientious regard to the<lb/>
Name of God, and every thing on which he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="stampt" auto="true">stamped</normalised> his Image.<lb/>
No wonder such as these, should solemnly devote and<lb/>
prostitute their Souls to Hell, by swearing even <normalised orig="falsly" auto="true">falsely</normalised> against others,<lb/>
when they have the Temptation and <normalised orig="Incouragement" auto="true">Encouragement</normalised> of<lb/>
getting Wealth and Riches, since they are so accustomed to affront<lb/>
their Maker, they think they never speak <normalised orig="gentilely" auto="true">gently</normalised>, unless<lb/>
they set their most high God at utmost Defiance, and do in Words<lb/>
at length challenge him to Damn them. He that sets himself apart<lb/>
to Sathan's Service by indulging to all the Lusts of the Flesh,<lb/>
that can boast of his Drunkenness, and Uncleanness, of his frequent<lb/>
Excesses, and every Days Debauch, that can unconcernedly,<lb/>
or rather with Triumph speak of his Hopes and Desires of<lb/>
being <normalised orig="Damn'd" auto="true">Damned</normalised> for ever, that Defiles the Air he speaks in, and offends<lb/>
all he comes amongst with his prodigious Oaths, and Execrations:<lb/>
This Man is ready prepared if an Occasion do offer it<lb/>
self, or can by any means be obtained, to Swear a Conscientious,<lb/>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
Religious Man out of his Right, and himself into it. That<lb/>
Man that will ordinarily <normalised orig="indanger" auto="true">endanger</normalised> his Soul, and Swear for nothing,<lb/>
will much more do so, be it right or wrong, when he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised><lb/>
the Temptation of Wealth, and it may be the Applause and<lb/>
Commendation of great Men for his <normalised orig="Incouragement" auto="true">Encouragement</normalised>.<lb/>
Having given this account of the two first Particulars: I shall<lb/>
now inquire whence it is that wicked Men are such bitter and<lb/>
inveterate Enemies against the Godly? Constant Experience is<lb/>
an <normalised orig="undenyable" auto="true">undeniable</normalised> Proof of the Truth of it, for no Age <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> passed,<lb/>
but the worst Men have <normalised orig="bin" auto="true">been</normalised> contriving and endeavouring to do<lb/>
the Righteous some Displeasure. We need not consult Histories,<lb/>
to Confirm what I am now treating of, for we may every<lb/>
where take Notice of the Deplorable Truth and Certainty of it<lb/>
amongst our selves. But from amongst the many Instances which<lb/>
might be mentioned as having some influence in and concurring<lb/>
to this, I will only name these few.<lb/>
1. There is a desperate and deadly Enmity against Godlyness,<lb/>
and so against good Men, rooted deeply in the Nature of wicked<lb/>
Men. Ever since we lost the Image of God, we are <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.3">by Nature<lb/>
the Children of Wrath</quote>, not only as we are subject and <normalised orig="lyable" auto="true">liable</normalised><lb/>
to the Wrath and Displeasure of God, but as we are of a wrathful,<lb/>
furious, and <normalised orig="unreconcilable" auto="true">irreconcilable</normalised> Temper. We are naturally Enemies<lb/>
not only to God, but to one another also. And it is to<lb/>
be ascribed principally, rather wholly, to the wise Conduct and<lb/>
Providence of God, that all Men are not constantly up in Arms,<lb/>
and always endeavouring the utter Extirpation one of another.<lb/>
But this Enmity is especially set against all Goodness. When<lb/>
Man lost <normalised orig="Holyness" auto="true">Holiness</normalised>, he became a most violent Adversary to it.<lb/>
As you observe when a Man <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> tasted of the good Word of<lb/>
God, and the Powers of the World to come, if he apostatize, he<lb/>
becomes the most Virulent and Implacable Enemy to it. So it<lb/>
is with Man naturally since the Fall. The Devils that were such<lb/>
pure and holy Angels, are now the greatest haters of <normalised orig="Holyness" auto="true">Holiness</normalised>.<lb/>
Wicked Men are of a <normalised orig="Curst" auto="true">Cursed</normalised>, Envious, Malicious Temper, they<lb/>
are of a Persecuting Nature, and have a great deal of Savageness<lb/>
in their Temper; they are against <normalised orig="Holyness" auto="true">Holiness</normalised>, as being contrary<lb/>
to their Nature, and thus become so violent against good Men.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="12">C2</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
Look at any Creature, you will find it <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> an aversion to those<lb/>
things, which are of a contrary Nature, and if there be any thing<lb/>
of Wildness, and Cruelty, and Savageness intermixed, then it<lb/>
is extraordinary violent against those which are of the contrary<lb/>
Nature. But those things which have not such a Savageness <normalised orig="Intermixt" auto="true">Intermixed</normalised>,<lb/>
they only testify their aversion by a <normalised orig="peacible" auto="false">peaceable</normalised> withdrawing<lb/>
themselves, not at all endeavouring the Destruction or Hurt<lb/>
of the other. This is very apparent in the Wolf and the Lamb:<lb/>
They delight not in the Society one of another, but the Lamb,<lb/>
though of so contrary a Nature to the Wolf, <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> not seek the<lb/>
Life or hurt of the Wolf; but the Wolf is not satisfied but with<lb/>
the total Destruction of the Lamb. Nor is this only because the<lb/>
Wolf <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> usually prey and feed on such Creatures, for then when<lb/>
the Hunger were satisfied, that rapacious and fierce Temper<lb/>
would cease. That Creature which is of a fierce and ravenous<lb/>
Nature, will destroy and kill not only out of Necessity, but also<lb/>
for Sport and Recreation. Thus wicked Men they are of a contrary<lb/>
Nature to the Godly, and have much wildness and ravenousness<lb/>
intermixed. They <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 4.16">cannot sleep unless they make some to fall;</quote>
                  <lb/>
and therefore they are resembled to, and set forth by those Creatures<lb/>
which are <normalised orig="wholy" auto="true">wholly</normalised> set upon destroying the Harmless and<lb/>
Innocent. They <normalised orig="lye" auto="true">lie</normalised> lurking privily in their Den, that they may catch<lb/>
the Righteous.<lb/>
If you ask what the Reason is that the Righteous and Holy do<lb/>
not Persecute the Wicked, as well as the Wicked do them, the<lb/>
Nature of each being equally contrary to each other? I answer,<lb/>
the Roughness and Severity of good <normalised orig="Mens" auto="true">Men's</normalised> Natures is taken away<lb/>
by that sanctifying and altering Grace which is bestowed on<lb/>
them, and for which they are so much hated by the other. The<lb/>
new Nature conferred on them, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> the harmlesness of the Dove<lb/>
accompanying it. A sanctified Nature so far as under the Power<lb/>
and Influence of Sanctification, <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> no Hatred, nor Envy, nor<lb/>
Malice, nor any other Quality that is hurtful. It dares not hate<lb/>
or hurt an Enemy.<lb/>
And the true reason why ungodly Men do no more hurt to the<lb/>
Righteous, is because God restrains them; he puts <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 37.29">his Hook into<lb/>
their Nose, and his Bridle into their Lips</quote>, and checks them.<lb/>
Contrariety <normalised orig="causeth" auto="true">causes</normalised> their Aversion to the Godly, but it is<lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
that fierceness which is intermixed, which <normalised orig="causeth" auto="true">causes</normalised> the Violence<lb/>
of the Persecution; as you see <normalised orig="Tygers" auto="true">Tigers</normalised>, Wolves, Lions, and Bears,<lb/>
do <normalised orig="persue" auto="true">pursue</normalised>, and kill, and devour Sheep, Lambs, and other Innocent<lb/>
and Profitable Creatures, and as Hawks and Kites do fly after<lb/>
and Prey on Turtle Doves and Pigeons, so do Wicked <normalised orig="outragious" auto="true">outrageous</normalised><lb/>
Ungodly Men Persecute and Trouble the Just and Holy.<lb/>
2. Their Natural Enmity is very much increased and excited<lb/>
into act by very unjust Prejudices, which they imbibe and entertain<lb/>
with Delight. A wicked persecuting Person and <normalised orig="rejoyceth" auto="true">rejoices</normalised> to<lb/>
hear of any thing, which tends to the Defamation, and Disrepute<lb/>
of one that is truly Religious. He <normalised orig="labors" auto="true">labours</normalised> to spread and<lb/>
divulge it abroad, and aggravates every Mistake, and almost<lb/>
unavoidable Infirmity, representing it as an hideous and unpardonable<lb/>
Crime. Nay he usually attributes the Faults of some<lb/>
particular Persons to the whole Profession. Thus the very Name<lb/>
of a Pious Man is Odious and Insupportable to him; and he talks<lb/>
as virulently against, and desires as vehemently the utter Destruction<lb/>
of every one, how Harmless, Good, and Innocent <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">however</normalised>,<lb/>
who comes under such a Denomination, as against the vilest Miscreant<lb/>
and Criminal in the World, tho he never knew or heard<lb/>
of any Hurt by the one, or any good by the other.<lb/>
It may not be amiss to take notice now of a Sin, that prevails<lb/>
exceedingly at this time amongst our selves; which is, that we<lb/>
have disputed our selves into so much Wrath, such an <normalised orig="Aversness" auto="true">Averseness</normalised><lb/>
and Enmity to one another, that Dissenters, and those who pretend<lb/>
to the Church, can scarce <normalised orig="indure" auto="true">endure</normalised> the Names of one another,<lb/>
unless some disgraceful and reproachful Term be annexed. Too<lb/>
many of them are become such fierce Adversaries one against another,<lb/>
that they have not only abandoned themselves from the<lb/>
eminent Exercise of that Charity and mutual Forbearance, common<lb/>
Christianity <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> very much <normalised orig="inforce" auto="true">enforce</normalised>, but they do with too<lb/>
much Appetite listen and inquire after, and instead of mourning<lb/>
for, do <normalised orig="rejoyce" auto="true">rejoice</normalised> and almost triumph in the Faults which particular<lb/>
Persons on either side are <normalised orig="chargible" auto="false">chargeable</normalised> with; and which is<lb/>
yet a greater Fault, they are too frequent in applying the Guilt<lb/>
beyond its due extent.<lb/>
By this means do those who are Corrupt, Carnal, and Sensual<lb/>
on each side, <normalised orig="labor" auto="true">labour</normalised> to increase our Animosities, and<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="14">13</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
make our Divisions wider and more unhealable.<lb/>
But it is most of all deplorable, that the Malignity and Poison<lb/>
of this course, seems to diffuse and spread it self amongst<lb/>
them who have given undeniable and prodigious Evidences of<lb/>
extraordinary Learning, and sometimes of very great and deservedly<lb/>
imitable Moderation and Equanimity: Which discovers<lb/>
that when People do apply themselves to advance any Party<lb/>
with undue Warmth, they forget to observe that Decorum, they<lb/>
have formerly commended to the World, and are too easily induced<lb/>
to use the meanest Arts in depressing the Cause they oppose.<lb/>
It is certainly very unbecoming and unworthy of Men of great<lb/>
Learning, <normalised orig="Holyness" auto="true">Holiness</normalised>, and Gravity to <normalised orig="indeavour" auto="true">endeavour</normalised> to defame all<lb/>
that are of the contrary <normalised orig="Perswasion" auto="true">Persuasion</normalised>, by suggesting to the World<lb/>
evil Surmises and Opinions concerning all in general, by reporting<lb/>
infamous Stories which concern only some few in particular:<lb/>
for besides the Injury they themselves do by this Means to those<lb/>
that are Innocent; they both Countenance the unjust Methods<lb/>
the worst of Men do use in decrying those they are against, and<lb/>
they furnish them with Materials to carry on their Design.<lb/>
This <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <normalised orig="bin" auto="true">been</normalised> an ancient Method, People have used to revenge<lb/>
themselves on the Innocent. <quote type="biblical" ana="Jer 20.10">Report say they, and we will<lb/>
Report.</quote> Do but either start any one Story that is real, with relation<lb/>
to some Particulars, or <normalised orig="fraim" auto="false">frame</normalised> and coin a Story that will appear<lb/>
Plausible, and let it once take Air, and we will soon help to<lb/>
transmit it further, and by this means we <quote type="biblical" ana="Jer 20.10">shall take our Revenge<lb/>
on them.</quote>
                  <lb/>
But what a dreadful Blow would be given to Christianity in<lb/>
the Opinion of its professed Enemies, should all Parties <normalised orig="labor" auto="true">labour</normalised> to<lb/>
rake together the foul and enormous Offences of particular Persons<lb/>
amongst those they do Oppose, and then publish them to<lb/>
the World, as what the whole Party <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> either approve, or may<lb/>
justly be charged with?<lb/>
There is no doubt but this Church (tho it's Government and<lb/>
Constitution be so pure, justifiable, and Consonant to Apostolical<lb/>
Practice) would suffer very much, should but the almost Ordinary<lb/>
mis-carriages of a great number who pretend to the Clergy<lb/>
be exposed to <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> view; with an account of the <normalised orig="Incouragement" auto="true">Encouragement</normalised><lb/>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
they meet with, or at least how free they are from Threats<lb/>
and Molestations, whilst others who lead better Lives, and are<lb/>
more constant and diligent Preachers, and do express on all Occasions<lb/>
more of that Charity and Forbearance towards all men,<lb/>
which Christianity <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> so much commend and <normalised orig="inforce" auto="true">enforce</normalised>, are<lb/>
frowned upon, and left open to the Rage and Fury of besotted<lb/>
<normalised orig="Frantick" auto="true">Frantic</normalised> and <normalised orig="Debauch'd" auto="true">Debauched</normalised> Bigots. There is no defence against unjust<lb/>
Prejudice.<lb/>
3. They apprehend, that the strict and Holy Lives of Religious<lb/>
men do very much reproach their lewd and vicious Courses.<lb/>
At least they find that their pure and Holy Doctrines do occasion<lb/>
them anguish and unquietness, disturbance and trouble in the<lb/>
perpetrating of their beloved <normalised orig="Wickednesses" auto="true">Wickedness</normalised>. Why could not<lb/>
Herodias suffer John Baptist to keep his Head any longer? It was<lb/>
because she could not live quietly in her uncleanness with her<lb/>
Husbands brother, whilst he was still Preaching to Herod, that <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 14.4">it<lb/>
was not lawful for him to have her.</quote> Indeed there is not any thing<lb/>
<normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> more effectually discover the horrid <normalised orig="Loathsomness" auto="true">Loathsomeness</normalised> of wicked<lb/>
<normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> Lusts and Practices, than the <normalised orig="Chast" auto="true">Chaste</normalised>, Holy, and strict<lb/>
Conversations of Pious men. And therefore they are so much<lb/>
against them, even because their Doctrines and Lives do so much<lb/>
reprove their wicked Works of darkness.<lb/>
4. Holy men are carrying on a different work from that which<lb/>
ungodly <normalised orig="lew'd" auto="true">lewd</normalised> men are Designing and Acting. They are servants<lb/>
to different Masters, and therefore it is not to be expected they<lb/>
should accord very well. The good Man's work <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> defeat<lb/>
and Ruin the Sinners, and therefore he is against him, and <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised><lb/>
persecute him all he can, because he belongs not to his Company,<lb/>
but is labouring to destroy his masters Kingdom, and overthrow<lb/>
what he esteems his own greatest Interest. <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 15.19">If <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> were of the<lb/>
World the World would love his own, but because <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised> are not of the World,<lb/>
but I have chosen you out of the World, therefore the World <normalised orig="hateth" auto="true">hates</normalised> you.</quote>
                  <lb/>
5. This proceeds many times from a very strong and Powerful<lb/>
impulse of Satan. As wicked men are his Slaves and doing<lb/>
his Work, so he <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> irritate and excite in a special manner to<lb/>
this very instance of Persecuting the Godly. The Devil thinks<lb/>
he has most work done when the greatest number of <choice ana="typeset-error">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr>Righteous</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
men fall: And he concludes that if he could by his Instruments<lb/>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
absolutely suppress the Righteous, he should Reign and Triumph<lb/>
in the World without any Opposition. The Devil <quote type="biblical" ana="Eph 2.2">Rules<lb/>
in the hearts of the Children of Disobedience.</quote> And it is worth our<lb/>
Observation, that immediately before Judas went to the High-Priest,<lb/>
&amp;c. to inform against and betray his Master, it is said <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 13.27">the<lb/>
Devil <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> into him</quote> So that one main instance, whence it is that<lb/>
wicked People do persecute the Righteous, is because the Devil is in<lb/>
them. The Devil <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> as truly possess, Act, and govern them<lb/>
that persecute the Righteous, as he did those that were called<lb/>
Demoniacks, when our Saviour was upon Earth. And tho he do<lb/>
not cause them now to Tear and Rent, and Torture themselves,<lb/>
as they did then, yet he has a more dreadful Influence on their<lb/>
Souls, and <normalised orig="indangers" auto="false">endangers</normalised> them much more as to their spiritual and<lb/>
final Estate.<lb/>
I am now in the last place to apply what has been discoursed<lb/>
concerning Persecution; and will do it in a few Words.<lb/>
1. For the support and <normalised orig="Incouragement" auto="true">Encouragement</normalised> of the Righteous, when<lb/>
Persecuted and in distress. Take care that the reproaches and<lb/>
Violences of the ungodly do not <normalised orig="afright" auto="true">affright</normalised> you from your uprightness,<lb/>
nor shake your <normalised orig="stedfastness" auto="true">steadfastness</normalised>. Those storms and <normalised orig="rufling" auto="false">ruffling</normalised><lb/>
Winds, their Threats and Menaces, should not break or overthrow<lb/>
you, but should rather have the same Influence on you,<lb/>
that blasts and Tempests have on firm and thriving Trees, whilst<lb/>
they break and overturn those that are Rotten and weak, they<lb/>
do only cause the other to take deeper and faster Root.<lb/>
This is no more than what you must expect, and what every<lb/>
good man ought daily to prepare for. He that is resolved for<lb/>
Heaven <quote type="biblical" ana="Acts 14.22">must go through many Tribulations</quote>; you are warned of such<lb/>
Treatment before-hand. Our Saviour has dealt so plainly with<lb/>
all his followers in this particular, that it is one great part of a<lb/>
Christians work to live <normalised orig="alway" auto="true">always</normalised> in Expectation of those things that<lb/>
so he may not be <normalised orig="surprized" auto="true">surprised</normalised> when they come. We have our every<lb/>
days Cross to wait for, and must be willing to take it up; and<lb/>
bear it away with Cheerfulness, when ever it comes. We have<lb/>
not the clearest and most unquestionable Evidences of the Truth,<lb/>
at least the Power of Christianity in and over us, till we can Cheerfully<lb/>
part with and resign up all, yea with Triumph bear away<lb/>
Reproaches, and Fears, and false Accusations, till we can lay<lb/>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
down our very Lives <normalised orig="rejoycing" auto="true">rejoicing</normalised> for Christ, his Gospel, and<lb/>
Religion, if occasion be.<lb/>
And if God sees fit to bring you to the <normalised orig="Tryal" auto="true">Trial</normalised>; it is that you<lb/>
may have the stronger assurance of your unfeigned Love to him,<lb/>
and unconquerable interest in him. And that you may display<lb/>
the Efficacy and Beauty of Religion unto the World in the most<lb/>
undeniable and Constraining instances. The Persecutions <choice ana="illegible">

up or <normalised orig="hindred" auto="true">hindered</normalised>, till Sloth, Carnality, and Superstitious conceits<lb/>
had corrupted the Minds and Lives of it's Professors, and this<lb/>
<normalised orig="happ'ned" auto="true">happened</normalised> after they were <normalised orig="burthened" auto="true">burdened</normalised> and over-loaded, with Honours,<lb/>
Ease, Preferments, and a multitude of unnecessary, and<lb/>
Superfluous outward Accommodations.<lb/>
The Saints and people of God have met with the same Treatment<lb/>
in all Ages. This has been their Lot and Portion, when<lb/>
they have lived amongst wicked loose People. And we generally<lb/>
find that they took great Satisfaction in it. Our blessed Saviour<lb/>
was used thus himself. How was he reviled, scorned, <normalised orig="reproach't" auto="true">reproached</normalised>,<lb/>
falsely accused, Spit upon, <normalised orig="Buffetted" auto="true">Buffeted</normalised>, <normalised orig="Whipt" auto="true">Whipped</normalised>, and at<lb/>
last disgracefully Crucified, by a degenerate inhumane People?<lb/>
You see the greatest and most absolute Innocence is not safe,<lb/>
from the Malicious rage, and violence of ungodly men. The<lb/>
Apostles presently after, were served in the same manner. And<lb/>
when they were Scourged, to render them a <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> scorn and<lb/>
reproach they went away <normalised orig="rejoycing" auto="true">rejoicing</normalised>, that they were counted<lb/>
worthy to be thus used for Christ. It is one part of the Vocation<lb/>
you are called to, to suffer for Christ: Phil 1.29. The more<lb/>
that wicked men do Load you with Contumelious <choice ana="illegible">

oppressive Fines and Mulcts, or do inflict on you Corporal Punishments<lb/>
and Torments, the more they do to raise you to the<lb/>
Likeness of the blessed Jesus.<lb/>
And indeed it is not the least matter of <normalised orig="rejoycing" auto="true">rejoicing</normalised>, that they<lb/>
who Persecute you, are only such as are <quote type="biblical" ana="Gal 4.29">born after the Flesh.</quote> Your Enemies,<lb/>
are they that are Enemies to God and Christ; worldly,<lb/>
sensual, <normalised orig="Devillish" auto="true">Devilish</normalised> men, <quote type="biblical" ana="Phil 3.18-19">who glory in their Shame, who make their<lb/>

spoken well of, by such as these, than to have them always spitting<lb/>
out their Venom, and darting forth their forked Tongues<lb/>
and Stings against you: They will speak well of none but such as<lb/>
are infected with their Disease. They that are the spawn of Satan,<lb/>
will undoubtedly have ill will to the Children of God.<lb/>
But what a <normalised orig="rejoycing" auto="true">rejoicing</normalised> is it, that by this very means, you are<lb/>
so particularly assured of a most glorious <normalised orig="Recompence" auto="true">Recompense</normalised>: Besides<lb/>
the inexpressible Consolation, God will secretly Communicate at<lb/>
present, he has provided, and in a special manner promised Incomprehensible<lb/>
Felicities hereafter. Mat 5.10, 11, 12. 1 Pet. 4.14.<lb/>
But then you must be sure that what you suffer for, be the cause<lb/>
of Christ. Let it be true and real Religion, Conscience indeed,<lb/>
and not any groundless <normalised orig="Phancy" auto="true">Fancy</normalised>, unreasonable <normalised orig="Humor" auto="true">Humour</normalised>, or unaccountable<lb/>
Resolution and <normalised orig="stubborness" auto="true">stubbornness</normalised> you suffer for. Especially<lb/>
beware <quote type="biblical" ana="1 Pet 4.15">that none of you suffer as a Murderer, or as a Thief, or as an<lb/>
Evildoer, or as a <normalised orig="busie" auto="true">busy</normalised> Body in other <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> Matters.</quote> These are the<lb/>
faults and Characters of Persecutors themselves, and for these<lb/>

for. Weigh your Opinions and your Practices in the <normalised orig="Ballance" auto="true">Balance</normalised><lb/>
of the Sanctuary. Be sure your cause be Good, and then if you are<lb/>
Persecuted and do suffer, come under what Denomination you<lb/>
will, and let your Persecutors be who they will, of how great<lb/>
Power and Authority so ever, I dare and will pray that <quote type="biblical" ana="Gal 6.16">Peace may<lb/>

Did ever any set themselves against God and prosper? The Lord<lb/>
Jesus <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> take what is done to his Followers and Disciples, as<lb/>

It were better for you, you had never been born or that some<lb/>
fatal, and miserable stroke had ended your Lives, as soon as you<lb/>
saw the Light, than that you should live to be Persecutors. Mat<lb/>
18.6. have not Persecutors <normalised orig="alway" auto="true">always</normalised> come to some fearful end?<lb/>
If you would not pull down divine Vengeance on your own<lb/>
Heads, if you would not make your selves and your Posterity infamous<lb/>
to all Generations, by inheriting the most dreadful Curses<lb/>
on your Bodies, your Estates, and all your Interests and Concerns,<lb/>
if you would not be the general abhorrence of mankind,<lb/>
if you would not Rot away <normalised orig="Peice-meal" auto="false">Peace-meal</normalised> whilst you are alive, if<lb/>
you would not be your own unpitied Executioners, if you would<lb/>
not be filled with Horror and Consternation by reason of a<lb/>
Wounding, Terrifying and accusing Conscience, if you would<lb/>
not Purchase to your selves the hottest Climate and Region in the<lb/>
infernal Pit, but can be content with an ordinary Damnation, if<lb/>
you have no desire to be the worst, the most miserable, the most<lb/>
Contemptible, of all that shall inherit everlasting burnings, take<lb/>
heed of this Sin. The Devil never feasts so deliciously, as when<lb/>
served with Persecutors and Informers.<lb/>
How variously and strangely has God testified his Displeasure<lb/>
and Wrath against Persecutors? Whole Volumes might be<lb/>
filled with bare Relations. Those Judgments have been inflicted<lb/>
on them, to make them a scorn an abhorrence, and a warning<lb/>
to Posterity, which were never known, or heard of in the World,<lb/>
till they were <normalised orig="punish't" auto="false">punished</normalised> and made infamous by them.<lb/>
And if you be Persecutors God has the same, and greater<lb/>
Plagues and Judgments in store for you.<lb/>
I know there are few who apply themselves to this Course,<lb/>
but they flatter themselves, and endeavour to <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised> others,<lb/>
with some or other false and pretended Excuses. But alas what<lb/>
will these avail you, whilst they are so Thin and Hollow not only<lb/>
the All-seeing-God, but the ordinary sort of People can see<lb/>
thorough them? Unless the cause be too black and horrid to obtain<lb/>
the Patronage of Hell, or the Actors be sordid and scandalous<lb/>
enough to make the Devil ashamed of them, he will furnish<lb/>
with some pretence to palliate and gloss the Fact.<lb/>
But it is not enough that you have something to Plead and<lb/>
say in your own defence amongst men, unless it be what will be<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="20">D2</fw>

                  <lb/>
warranted and approved by the judge of all, for if you could so<lb/>
varnish the severity you use to others, as to obtain the <normalised orig="favorable" auto="true">favourable</normalised><lb/>
opinion of the generality of men concerning it, what will<lb/>
this avail you, if when you appear before the great Tribunal,<lb/>
you be found amongst Persecutors? All false Colours, and meretricious<lb/>
Paint will then disappear.<lb/>
Now to secure you from this danger, it will be needful to have<lb/>
a constant regard to these two Rules.<lb/>
1. Have nothing to do with hurting, or contracting damages<lb/>
on any serious, upright, Conscientious Christian. Be not accessory<lb/>
for a World to the <normalised orig="Ruine" auto="true">Ruin</normalised>, or needless prejudice of any one, who<lb/>
stands fast in the faith of Christ. Those who agree with us in all<lb/>
the Substantials of Religion, and add no dangerous or Destructive<lb/>
Tenet to these, who are Holy, Sober, <normalised orig="Chast" auto="true">Chaste</normalised>, Temperate, Righteous,<lb/>
Compassionate and merciful, and who no way <normalised orig="indeavour" auto="true">endeavour</normalised> to<lb/>
disturb the <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> peace, but are Vigorous Protestants, and resolute<lb/>
opposers of the common Enemies of our Religion, and Civil<lb/>
Rights, they ought (especially considering our present Circumstances)<lb/>
to be so far from being Persecuted and oppressed,<lb/>
as to have all the <normalised orig="Incouragement" auto="true">Encouragement</normalised> and Countenance that pious<lb/>
Christians, and Loyal Subjects can claim and deserve. Do not<lb/>
hurt, persecute, or revile any, whom you have reason to believe<lb/>
the Lord Jesus will own, approve and honour. Will Christ ever<lb/>
thank men at the great day for keeping such out from Communion with his<lb/>
Church, whom he will vouchsafe not only Crowns of Glory to, but it may<lb/>
be Aureola too, if there be any such thing there? <lb/>
It had been well for Pilate, if he had hearkened to that seasonable<lb/>
message, <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 27.19">have thou nothing to do with that just men.</quote>
                  <lb/>
2. Take heed of, and avoid the very appearances of this Sin.<lb/>
Keep at as great a distance from it, as possible. Do not Cherish in<lb/>
your minds, any thing that may <normalised orig="ingage" auto="true">engage</normalised>, or incline to it. Cast away<lb/>
all unjust Prejudices, <normalised orig="Mortifie" auto="true">Mortify</normalised> Wrath and Anger: and shut<lb/>
your Ears against them that would incense you against those, you<lb/>
differ from, by reporting false and malicious stories of them.<lb/>
Supposing it could not properly be called Persecution to prosecute,<lb/>
and be severe with People about those things, which you<lb/>
are satisfied in your own minds, God has not <normalised orig="concern'd" auto="true">concerned</normalised> himself<lb/>
about, either by Commanding or forbidding them, yet your Ruining,<lb/>

or making others suffer extremely for these things, whilst<lb/>
they have other apprehensions either of the Nature or use<lb/>
of them, will unavoidably look too like Persecution (I think)<lb/>
for a serious Compassionate Christian to tolerate himself in.<lb/>
This seems not to have any of that Meekness, <normalised orig="Condescention" auto="true">Condescension</normalised>,<lb/>
and Forbearance our Religion <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> so expressly and so vehemently<lb/>
<normalised orig="inforce" auto="true">enforce</normalised>.<lb/>
Nay your addicting your selves to such Courses will <normalised orig="indanger" auto="true">endanger</normalised><lb/>
the <normalised orig="indearing" auto="true">endearing</normalised> of a rough, <normalised orig="sowre" auto="true">sour</normalised>, and unpeaceable temper to you.<lb/>
And it may be it will at last hurry you, into such Exorbitances, as<lb/>
you did not at first either Design, or think of; nay which will amount<lb/>
to inexcusable and down-right Persecution.<lb/>
This will certainly make way for your entertaining very unjust<lb/>
Prejudices against others. It will lay you <normalised orig="lyable" auto="true">liable</normalised> to greater Transports<lb/>
in your Passions. It will expose you to more and stronger<lb/>
Temptations, than you are at first aware of, it will lay you open<lb/>
to the wiles of Satan, that cunning Adversary, and great<lb/>
destroyer of the Godly.<lb/>
Nay it is probable enough, that when those Christian Sentiments<lb/>
and Resolves, you do at present retain, are a little worn<lb/>
off, and by disuse become feeble, the very desire and ambition<lb/>
of acquaintance with men of Power and Repute, who are Enemies<lb/>
to Protestants as such, may <normalised orig="ingage" auto="true">engage</normalised> you in those Practices,<lb/>
which both your deceitful Hearts and the better hopes of others,<lb/>
made you believe you should for ever detest.<lb/>
Satan very seldom Attempts to draw any man to direct Persecution<lb/>
at first; He only leads them at first to the out-skirts, and<lb/>
Fleshes them by degrees. But when he has once brought men to<lb/>
take Pleasure in seeing others suffer, tho not for real Religion, the<lb/>
sweetness of Blood, or the Satisfaction of getting Wealth, or<lb/>
the Honour of being caressed by great men, will <normalised orig="indanger" auto="true">endanger</normalised> to<lb/>
<normalised orig="qualifie" auto="true">qualify</normalised> them to undertake with unconcernedness and Triumph<lb/>
the most barbarous and inhumane Persecutions imaginable.<lb/>
