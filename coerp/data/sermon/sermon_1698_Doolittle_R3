VI. All the Provisions and Preparations<lb/>
that the Blessed Glorious God has<lb/>
made to welcome Sinners, when they<lb/>
come to him, do all cry aloud to you,<lb/>
to make all earnest <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>. The Eternal<lb/>
God has made a great Preparation for<lb/>
thee: this Blessed God invites thee: Sinner<lb/>
make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> and come to me, thou<lb/>
wilt be Damned if thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> not; O sinner,<lb/>
make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>, and come quickly unto<lb/>
me; thou wilt perish for ever if thou<lb/>
<normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> not come quickly unto me; I have<lb/>

                  <fw type="pageNum" n="54">D3</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
a Pardon for thee, come to me, I have a<lb/>
Heaven for thee, come to me I have<lb/>
prepared a Kingdom and a <normalised orig="Crowne" auto="true">Crown</normalised> for<lb/>
thee, and <normalised orig="loe" auto="true">lo</normalised> thou shalt dwell with me<lb/>
for ever; though thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> Rebelled, I<lb/>
will Pardon thee if thou wilt come to<lb/>
me; though thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> deserved Hell, I<lb/>
will give thee Heaven, if thou wilt come<lb/>
to me: Behold, this Blessed God made<lb/>
<normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> to send his Son, and Jesus Christ<lb/>
made <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> to come and <normalised orig="dye" auto="true">die</normalised>, the Spirit<lb/>
makes <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> to come and move upon<lb/>
thy Conscience, and the Ministers of<lb/>
Christ make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> to come and offer<lb/>
Christ to thee; now shall God make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>,<lb/>
and Jesus Christ make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>, and the<lb/>
Spirit make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>, and Ministers make<lb/>
<normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>, and wilt not thou make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>?<lb/>
VII. My <choice ana="print">
                     <sic>Sevnth</sic>
                     <corr>Seventh</corr>
                  </choice> Argument shall be<lb/>
to Consider your time that you have to<lb/>
come to God.<lb/>
First of all, The time that thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised><lb/>
allowed thee to come to God in, it is but<lb/>
short, and but a little time, a few more<lb/>
Years or Months. Weeks or Days, and<lb/>
thy Life will be ended. O Sinner, consider<lb/>
where thou <normalised orig="standest" auto="true">stand</normalised>! Upon the<lb/>
brink of Eternity, upon the Borders of<lb/>
another World; thou art near, exceeding<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
near to Heaven or Hell, and yet<lb/>
wilt thou make no more <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>?<lb/>
2. This little time that thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>, it<lb/>
is <normalised orig="hastning" auto="true">hastening</normalised> away quickly. O how<lb/>
swift does yonder Sun in the Firmament<lb/>
move! Sirs, do you not see how<lb/>
one Day and one Night <normalised orig="rouls" auto="true">rolls</normalised> away after<lb/>
another, and one Week, one Sabbath<lb/>
goes away after another, and thy<lb/>
time is a <normalised orig="hastning" auto="true">hastening</normalised>, whether thou art<lb/>
a Drinking, or a Sporting? Sinner,<lb/>
except thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> stop the Suns going<lb/>
of its Race, stay in thy Sins no longer.<lb/>
3. This <normalised orig="hastning" auto="true">hastening</normalised> time it is very uncertain<lb/>
too when it shall end, when an<lb/>
end shall be put unto it; Sinner, <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised><lb/>
thou tell, that thou shalt live till to<lb/>
Morrow: let the man stand forth, that<lb/>
can say, I am sure I shall live till to<lb/>
Morrow; Which is the Man amongst<lb/>
you all that can say, This hour I am<lb/>
sure of the next, and this Lord's day,<lb/>
that can say, I am sure of another? Who<lb/>
knows, but thou art keeping thy last<lb/>
Sabbath, and hearing thy last last Sermon?<lb/>
Who knows, but thou art making the<lb/>
last appearance in a <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Congregation?<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="Prov 27.1">Boast not thy self of to Morrow, for<lb/>
                     <lb/>
                     <fw type="pageNum" n="56">D4</fw>
                     <pb n="3"/>
                     <lb/>
thou <normalised orig="knowest" auto="true">know</normalised> not what a Day may bring forth.</quote>
                  <lb/>
Ah Sinner, thou wilt be found to be the<lb/>
Fool of all Fools, that <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> not know how<lb/>
soon thou <normalised orig="mayest" auto="true">may</normalised> depart this World, yet<lb/>
<normalised orig="triflest" auto="false">trifle</normalised> and <normalised orig="delayest" auto="false">delay</normalised>, and wilt not make<lb/>
<normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> to come to God.<lb/>
4. Thy time that is past, will never<lb/>
come again; if thou <normalised orig="wouldst" auto="true">would</normalised> give thousands<lb/>
for Yesterday, it <choice ana="print">
                     <sic>connot</sic>
                     <corr>cannot</corr>
                  </choice> be Recalled:<lb/>
Or for last Lord's day, it cannot<lb/>
be Recalled again: Consider your time,<lb/>
then judge if it be not high time for you<lb/>
to make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>, and to delay no longer.<lb/>
VIII. Yet I pray you consider, all the<lb/>
time you do delay you are abusing the<lb/>
Mercy of God, and abusing of the Patience<lb/>
of God; Is this a thing to delay<lb/>
in? Does the Eternal God stay, yet does<lb/>
not Damn thee, and cast thee down to<lb/>
Hell, which he may do every Hour at<lb/>
his Pleasure? And does he tarry and not<lb/>
Punish thee? And <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> thou tarry and<lb/>
wilt not come and submit to him? This<lb/>
God is <normalised orig="intreating" auto="true">entreating</normalised> of thee to accept of<lb/>
Mercy, and is <normalised orig="loth" auto="true">loath</normalised> that thou <normalised orig="shouldst" auto="true">should</normalised><lb/>
Perish, or lose thy poor Soul. Now is<lb/>
offering of the Rich Blessings, Purchased<lb/>
so dear, as by the blood of his<lb/>
own Son? and while thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> neglect,<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
What <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> thou but say in thy heart I<lb/>
care not for God, nor for his Christ<lb/>
neither? Ah Sinner, remember the time<lb/>
is coming, the hour is <normalised orig="hastning" auto="true">hastening</normalised>, that<lb/>
thou <normalised orig="wouldst" auto="true">would</normalised> give Ten Thousand Worlds<lb/>
if thou <normalised orig="hadst" auto="true">had</normalised> them, for that Grace which<lb/>
now thou <normalised orig="despiseth" auto="true">despises</normalised>, <normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>. 7. <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 2.4"><normalised orig="despisest" auto="true">despises</normalised> thou<lb/>
the goodness of God, not considering that the<lb/>
Patience and Long-suffering of God should<lb/>
lead thee to repentance!</quote>
                  <lb/>
IX. Thy Delaying has in it a great<lb/>
deal of bold, and blind Presumption.<lb/>
Thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> presume, Sinner, of such<lb/>
things that thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> not any grounds<lb/>
to make reckoning of. There are three<lb/>
or four things that a trifling Sinner, a<lb/>
delaying Sinner presumes of.<lb/>
1. Thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> presume that thou shalt<lb/>
live longer yet; thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> presume, that<lb/>
thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> more time to spend in this<lb/>
World; thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> suppose that thou<lb/>
mayst have another Year yet, another<lb/>
Month still, another Week still; Tell<lb/>
me if this be not in thy Heart; Thou<lb/>
art worse than a mad-man indeed, that<lb/>
wilt not make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> and come to Christ?<lb/>
but this is a bold presumption ; thou<lb/>
<normalised orig="talkest" auto="true">talk</normalised> of another Year, when thou<lb/>
mayst not have another Hour.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="58">D5</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
2. Thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> presume, that thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised><lb/>
                  <choice ana="typeset-error">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr>Repent</corr>
                  </choice> when thou wilt, and turn to<lb/>
God when thou wilt; thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> presume<lb/>
that thy own will is of thy own strength;<lb/>
but Sinner either thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> Repent<lb/>
when thou wilt, or thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> not; if<lb/>
thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> and <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> not, behold thou<lb/>
art inexcusable; but if thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> not<lb/>
Repent now, <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> thou think thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised><lb/>
better Repent hereafter, when thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised><lb/>
hardened thy Heart yet more in Sin?<lb/>
3. In thy Delaying, thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> presume,<lb/>
that the Spirit of God will help<lb/>
thee hereafter, as well as now, for if<lb/>
this were not in thy hopes, if thou didst<lb/>
not suppose this, if thou <normalised orig="wert" auto="true">were</normalised> not bereaved<lb/>
of thy Understanding, <normalised orig="Wouldst" auto="true">Would</normalised><lb/>
not thou Repent now, while the Spirit<lb/>
of God moves upon thy heart? How<lb/>
<normalised orig="dost" auto="true">do</normalised> thou know, but hereafter the Spirit<lb/>
of God may let the alone and give<lb/>
thee up to the hardness of thy own<lb/>
Heart? God may say to thee, as to<lb/>
Ephraim, Hosea 4.17. <quote type="biblical" ana="Hos 4.17">Ephraim is <normalised orig="joyned" auto="true">joined</normalised><lb/>
to Idols, let him alone.</quote> Ah Sinner, if God<lb/>
says once, Let him alone, then all the Sermons<lb/>
in the world will do no good:<lb/>
If God would say to the delaying Sinner,<lb/>
My Spirit let him alone, and mine Ordinances<lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
let him alone, and my Ministers let<lb/>
him alone; That tho you have the voice<lb/>
of the Gospel in your Ears, yet God will<lb/>
let thy heart alone.<lb/>
X. And the last Argument to persuade<lb/>
you to make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> is this, it may be you<lb/>
may be <normalised orig="loth" auto="true">loath</normalised> to hear it; I wish, Sinner,<lb/>
that by the <normalised orig="yeilding" auto="true">yielding</normalised> to all the rest, thou<lb/>
<normalised orig="wouldest" auto="true">would</normalised> give me Reason to forbear to<lb/>
speak it; but if all that has been said,<lb/>
will not move thee to make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>, then<lb/>
know that thy Damnation is hastening,<lb/>
the time of thy lying in Torment<lb/>
is hastening, the hour of thy being<lb/>
thrown down to Devils, and lying in<lb/>
Chains of Darkness, is hastening. Sinner,<lb/>
tho thou <normalised orig="slumberest" auto="false">slumbered</normalised>, yet thy Damnation<lb/>
does not slumber,<lb/>
                  <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Pet 2.3">Whose Judgment now of a long time <normalised orig="lingereth" auto="true">lingers</normalised><lb/>
not, and their Damnation <normalised orig="lingereth" auto="true">lingers</normalised> not.</quote>
                  <lb/>
Thou <normalised orig="lingerest" auto="false">lingered</normalised> and <normalised orig="loyterst" auto="false">loytered</normalised>, <normalised orig="ay" auto="false">aye</normalised>, but thy<lb/>
Damnation does not slumber, <normalised orig="Deut" auto="true">Deuteronomy</normalised>.<lb/>
32.35. Consider of that place, <quote type="biblical" ana="Deut 32.35">To me,</quote>
                  <lb/>
says God, <quote type="biblical" ana="Deut 32.35"><normalised orig="belongeth" auto="true">belongs</normalised> Vengeance and <normalised orig="Recompence" auto="true">Recompense</normalised>;<lb/>
their foot shall slide in due time,<lb/>
for the Day of their Calamity is at hand,<lb/>
and the thing that shall come upon<lb/>
thee <normalised orig="maketh" auto="true">makes</normalised> <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>.</quote> Mark, the Day of<lb/>
thy Calamity is at hand, and the<lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
thing, the Wrath of God that shall come<lb/>
upon thee <normalised orig="maketh" auto="true">makes</normalised> <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>; the Justice of<lb/>
God that shall overtake thee, makes<lb/>
<normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>. O then, if thou <normalised orig="would'st" auto="true">would</normalised> make<lb/>
<normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> to escape those dreadful things<lb/>
that are hastening, do you make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised><lb/>
and delay not to keep the Commandments<lb/>
of your God.<lb/>
Thus I have given you many Arguments<lb/>
and Motives; and if I thought<lb/>
that you had made <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> and come away<lb/>
to Christ, I would change my Text<lb/>
and go upon another Subject, but I<lb/>
doubt, after all, that thou art <normalised orig="lingring" auto="true">lingering</normalised>;<lb/>
I would therefore yet try to put thee on,<lb/>
and would direct this Exhortation to<lb/>
five sorts of People.<lb/>
First of all, I would <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> such of<lb/>
you as are Young, that you would<lb/>
make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>, and not delay, even you that<lb/>
are Children, little Children, the youngest<lb/>
amongst you that understand what<lb/>
the sense is of any of these things. O do<lb/>
you make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> you young Men in your<lb/>
Youth make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> and do not delay.<lb/>
II. I would direct this Exhortation to<lb/>
such of you as are old, old Sinners, for<lb/>
God's sake make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>, you that are threescore<lb/>
years old and more, make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>.<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="61">60</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
III. To such of you as are Strong and<lb/>
Healthful of Body.<lb/>
IV. To you that are Sickly and Crazy<lb/>
Persons, often Sick and seldom<lb/>
Well, for God's sake make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>.<lb/>
V. To such of you as have been Sick,<lb/>
and now are Well, as have been upon<lb/>
Beds of Sickness near to Death, but God<lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> set thee upon thy Legs again. O<lb/>
make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>, and do not delay to keep<lb/>
the Commandments of God.<lb/>
First then, You that are young, you<lb/>
that are yet in your Childhood, you<lb/>
young Children, you Young men and<lb/>
Maids; O do you make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>, and do<lb/>
not delay to keep the Commandments<lb/>
of God. I would rather press this Counsel<lb/>
upon you, because you chiefly <normalised orig="lye" auto="true">lie</normalised> under<lb/>
the temptations of delay; for you<lb/>
Children have very naughty hearts, and<lb/>
<normalised orig="loth" auto="true">loath</normalised> to be good, and come to God; you<lb/>
are apt to think, that you have time<lb/>
enough yet: that you may take your<lb/>
Pleasure and mind your Sports now, and<lb/>
think of God hereafter, and think of<lb/>
Heaven and Hell hereafter. But I have<lb/>
Ten Questions to propose to you, you<lb/>
Young ones, and by that time I have<lb/>
come through these, I hope you will see<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="62">61</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
that there is no Reason for you to delay,<lb/>
tho you are young.<lb/>
I. Tell me, Are you so young that you<lb/>
may not die? are you so young that you may<lb/>
not be sick? Are you Young Men exempted<lb/>
from Death and the Grave? Have you<lb/>
not observed, that as young as you, and<lb/>
younger too, have gone down to the Grave?<lb/>
Have you not seen little Infants carried<lb/>
to the Grave? Have not you seen Infants<lb/>
laid in the Dust? Have you not seen<lb/>
many times that their is but little difference<lb/>
betwixt the Birth and the Grave?<lb/>
If you doubt of this, go into some Churchyard,<lb/>
and see if you may not find there<lb/>
Graves of all sizes; an Infant was buried<lb/>
here, another young one was buried<lb/>
there, who was not so tall as I; Very<lb/>
well, if you are not so young, but you<lb/>
may die, are you so young then, that<lb/>
you may not make your Peace with<lb/>
God?<lb/>
II. Are you so young that you may<lb/>
not be damned? Has God any where<lb/>
told you in his Word, that No Young<lb/>
Ones shall go to Hell, those that die in<lb/>
their Youth? Tell me, were not you<lb/>
born in Sin? And are you not by Nature<lb/>
Children of Wrath? And by reason<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="63">62</fw>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
of that sin in which you were born,<lb/>
are you not liable to the wrath of God,<lb/>
to the Damnation of Hell, and to the<lb/>
Torments of the Damned? Besides,<lb/>
have not you Young Men many sins of<lb/>
your own <normalised orig="commiting" auto="false">committing</normalised>, actual Sins? How<lb/>
soon didst thou learn to <normalised orig="Lye" auto="true">Lie</normalised>? How<lb/>
soon did you learn to take God's Holy<lb/>
Name in vain? How soon did you play<lb/>
upon the Lord's Day, and so <normalised orig="mispend" auto="false">misspend</normalised><lb/>
your precious time? By all these you<lb/>
have deserved Death and Hell too? and<lb/>
if you are not so Young; but you may<lb/>
be Damned, is there any room for you<lb/>
to delay, and not to do what God commands<lb/>
you to do?<lb/>
III. I pray tell me, Is it fit that you<lb/>
should give the first of your time to the<lb/>
Devil, rather than unto God; for you<lb/>
first to serve the Devil, than next to<lb/>
serve God; to give your Youth unto him<lb/>
that would devour and destroy your<lb/>
Souls, rather than to God, that would<lb/>
save your Souls, and make them happy?<lb/>
Should you give to Satan the first of<lb/>
your time, that deserves none at all? And<lb/>
Sirs, I tell you, that you deserve to be<lb/>
Damned, if you give one hour. Think<lb/>
of it, What would the World think of<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="64">63</fw>
                  <pb n="11"/>
                  <lb/>
you if you deal with your Parents as<lb/>
you deal with the Eternal God? if you<lb/>
should say, Father I will rebel against you<lb/>
while I am Young, I will vex and grieve you<lb/>
whilst Young, but I will be Dutiful to you<lb/>
when I am Old; Will you in effect say<lb/>
worse to God? And say, We will do<lb/>
what the Devil saith to us now, and we<lb/>
will do what God commands us hereafter.<lb/>
Tell me, Who was it that gave you<lb/>
your Being? Who was it that formed<lb/>
you in your Mothers Womb? Who<lb/>
was it that brought you forth? Who<lb/>
was it that preserved you, whilst you<lb/>
hung upon your Mothers Breast? Who<lb/>
is it that kept you from Death and Hell<lb/>
to this day, that might have cast you<lb/>
into utter Darkness, as soon as you beheld<lb/>
the Light of the Sun? Has the Devil<lb/>
done for you, as God has done, or<lb/>
can you expect he shall or will? Lay all<lb/>
these together, then see if it be fitting<lb/>
that you should serve the Devil first.<lb/>
IV. Tell me, you that are young, Can<lb/>
you be good too soon? Or can you love<lb/>
your God too soon? Or can you mind<lb/>
your Souls too soon? Or can you (think<lb/>
you) be mindful to escape the Damnation<lb/>
of Hell too soon? Can you be too<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="65">64</fw>
                  <pb n="12"/>
                  <lb/>
soon sure of Heaven? Tell me, Would<lb/>
it do thee any harm to know in thy<lb/>
Youth that thy Soul shall be saved?<lb/>
Would it do thee any harm to believe<lb/>
in Christ, to love God above all, and<lb/>
to understand, whenever thou shalt die,<lb/>
that thy Soul should be received to Heaven?<lb/>
Remember this, that there <choice ana="print">
                     <sic>havebeen</sic>
                     <corr>have been</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
many who have been troubled that they<lb/>
did repent too late, but there was never<lb/>
one in this World that ever repented<lb/>
that he repented too soon. Thousands,<lb/>
and Ten Thousands have bewailed<lb/>
that they have staid off from<lb/>
Christ so long.<lb/>
V. Is not Youth, and Young in Years,<lb/>
the usual time for God to Convert Sinners<lb/>
to his Son? especially, those whom<lb/>
he <normalised orig="planteth" auto="true">plants</normalised> under the Gospel in the<lb/>
time of their Youth. O you that are set<lb/>
under Preaching, if you are not converted<lb/>
whilst you are young, it is a<lb/>
thousand to one, if ever you are Converted.<lb/>
Pray Sirs consider, Is it usual for<lb/>
God to Convert Old Sinners? I know,<lb/>
God sometimes may call at the Eleventh<lb/>
Hour, but it is but here and there one,<lb/>
now and then one; and commonly they<lb/>
are such as did not sit under the means of<lb/>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
Grace when they were Young; if you<lb/>
delay whilst Young, You may let slip<lb/>
the very season of Conversion, then<lb/>
your Souls cannot be brought over to<lb/>
God by all the Preaching in the World.<lb/>
Do we not amongst our selves observe<lb/>
that for one Old Person, one Old Sinner,<lb/>
that is made sensible of sin, and of his<lb/>
lost estate, though never so vile, that<lb/>
does desire the Prayers of a Congregation<lb/>
for them, have we not Twenty, yea<lb/>
Forty, that are younger, that desire<lb/>
your Prayers from them?<lb/>
VI. Will it not be easier for you to repent<lb/>
now, than it will be hereafter, when<lb/>
by long continuance in sin, you have<lb/>
<normalised orig="hardned" auto="true">hardened</normalised> your hearts and feared your<lb/>
Consciences, and have been accustomed<lb/>
to do wickedly? Certainly, now, whilst<lb/>
Conscience is tender, and the Heart<lb/>
more tender, it will be easier for you to<lb/>
let go your sin now, and to leave your<lb/>
Wickedness now, than it will be Forty<lb/>
Years hence; for the longer you continue<lb/>
in sin, the stronger is Sin upon<lb/>
you, and the stronger your Sin is, the<lb/>
harder your Heart is, and the harder<lb/>
will be your Repentance, as Jeremiah<lb/>
speaks, <quote type="biblical" ana="Jer 13.23">Can the Ethiopian change his skin<lb/>
                     <pb n="14"/>
                     <lb/>
or the Leopard his spots? Then may <normalised orig="ye" auto="true">you</normalised><lb/>
that are accustomed to do Evil, learn to do<lb/>
well.</quote>
                  <lb/>
VII. Shall you not prevent a multitude<lb/>
of Sins, if you make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> in your<lb/>
Younger <choice ana="typeset-error">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr>Years</corr>
                  </choice> to come to God? whereas<lb/>
if you go on in your Sins, what a<lb/>
Multitude of sins, how many Thousand<lb/>
sins will you add more and more to the<lb/>
sins that you have already committed;<lb/>
if you loiter still, how many Prayers<lb/>
will you neglect; And how many Sabbaths<lb/>
<normalised orig="prophane" auto="true">profane</normalised>? And how many lies<lb/>
tell, and make no Conscience? And how<lb/>
many Oaths may some of your swear?<lb/>
Whereas, now if you would come to<lb/>
God in your Youth, if you would now<lb/>
Believe and Repent, and come to God,<lb/>
O what a number of Sins may you prevent<lb/>
the commission of! And is not<lb/>
this desirable? You have sinned enough<lb/>
already, the Youngest amongst<lb/>
you have sinned enough already, you<lb/>
need not go on still, and add more and<lb/>
more to your sins; for they are not to<lb/>
be <normalised orig="numbred" auto="true">numbered</normalised> already<lb/>
VIII. Consider, Will not this be most<lb/>
pleasing unto God, if you hasten in your<lb/>
Youth to come to God? Early is the<lb/>
                  <pb n="15"/>
                  <lb/>
time; O, Christ loves Young Ones indeed,<lb/>
when they will be good. Mark 10.23, 24<lb/>
This was a Young man that had<lb/>
but some common good in him; and<lb/>
it is said, That Christ looked upon him<lb/>
and loved him, Jerem. 2.2. Says God to<lb/>
Israel, <quote type="biblical" ana="Jer 2.2">I remember the kindness of thy Youth,<lb/>
the love of thy Espousal.</quote> Ah, God takes<lb/>
it kindly, and Christ takes it kindly,<lb/>
when you do believe on Christ, and<lb/>
leave your sins betimes. O will not you<lb/>
do that which God and Christ will take<lb/>
kindly at your hands! then make haste<lb/>
whilst you are young, and do not stay<lb/>
till you are old. O it is pleasing unto<lb/>
God to see young ones come and Pray<lb/>
and Believe, to see young ones following<lb/>
after Christ, Eccles. 12.1. <quote type="biblical" ana="Eccl 12.1">Remember<lb/>
thy Creator in the days of thy Youth.</quote>
                  <lb/>
Now tell me, Young Men, Is it not better<lb/>
for you to be pleasing to this blessed<lb/>
God whilst you are young, than to be<lb/>
provoking of him till you are Old?<lb/>
Is it not more pleasing to have his Love<lb/>
and Smiles, than to have his Anger and<lb/>
Frowns.<lb/>
IX. If you make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> whilst you are<lb/>
young, shall not you have the more time<lb/>
to serve your God, and glorify your<lb/>
                  <pb n="16"/>
                  <lb/>
Maker? And is not this the End for<lb/>
which thou <normalised orig="wert" auto="true">were</normalised> born? Is not this the<lb/>
End for which you were made, that you<lb/>
may glorify him that gave your being<lb/>
unto you? And tell me, Can you begin<lb/>
this Work too soon? Or, Can you do<lb/>
this one thing too much? O young men,<lb/>
think, Will God save you when you die,<lb/>
and will not you serve him whilst you<lb/>
live? Will God <normalised orig="glorifie" auto="true">glorify</normalised> you hereafter<lb/>
in Heaven, and will not you <normalised orig="glorifie" auto="true">glorify</normalised><lb/>
God whilst you are here upon Earth?<lb/>
Tell me, Do you think you can honour<lb/>
God in a little time, and in Old Age<lb/>
too; as you may in a great deal, beginning<lb/>
from your youth, to your Elder<lb/>
years? I tell you, that Multitudes of<lb/>
good People upon their Death-Beds<lb/>
when they have been going to Heaven,<lb/>
they have been full of Grief upon this<lb/>
Account, That they served God so late,<lb/>
and loved God so late; that are going<lb/>
to Heaven to live with God, and have<lb/>
done no more for God when they were<lb/>
here upon Earth.<lb/>
X. And Lastly, If you now make<lb/>
<normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> whilst you are young, shall not you<lb/>
have the more time to do the great<lb/>
Work in your own Souls that is there<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="70">69</fw>
                  <pb n="17"/>
                  <lb/>
to be done? O what a great deal of<lb/>
Work does lie within us? What a great<lb/>
deal of Work does lie upon our Hearts<lb/>
to be done! upon our Souls! Is it not<lb/>
more likely that you should do more in<lb/>
Forty years time, than in Five or Ten,<lb/>
or the latter end of your days? O how<lb/>
much Knowledge is there to be had of<lb/>
God and of Christ and the great Mystery<lb/>
of the Gospel! You will have more<lb/>
time to get a greater measure of the<lb/>
Love of God and of Jesus Christ; you<lb/>
will have more time to get Assurance of<lb/>
the Love of God and of Eternal Glory;<lb/>
you will have more time to make your<lb/>
preparation for Death, and the great<lb/>
Account that you have to give unto God<lb/>
after Death. Now take these Ten things<lb/>
along with you, and then see, if there be<lb/>
any room or reason for you to delay<lb/>
though young, but make all the <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised><lb/>
you can to do that God commands, That<lb/>
is the first Sort.<lb/>
2. The Sort. that I would urge this<lb/>
upon, is, you that are Old, You Old<lb/>
Sinners, consider the Work that you<lb/>
have to do<lb/>
I. Of all, you that are old, O make<lb/>
<normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised>? for your time is almost gone, your<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="71">70</fw>
                  <pb n="18"/>
                  <lb/>
Glass is almost run, your Sun is near to<lb/>
setting; in a Course of Nature you<lb/>
have not much time to live. Behold!<lb/>
Look upon your gray Hairs, and they<lb/>
will tell you, that you are going off the<lb/>
Stage of this World, and are <normalised orig="entring" auto="true">entering</normalised><lb/>
into another World. The Age of Man,<lb/>
that the most do reach ordinarily, is<lb/>
Threescore and Ten, <normalised orig="Psal" auto="true">Psalm</normalised>. 90.10. <quote type="psalm" ana="Ps 90.10">The<lb/>
Age of Man is Treescore Years and Ten.</quote>
                  <lb/>
O is there not some in this place that<lb/>
have not outlived the usual time? Are<lb/>
not some of you Threescore Years and<lb/>
upward? Are not some of you Seventy<lb/>
Years and more? O how near, how very<lb/>
near are you to another World! You<lb/>
are almost at your Journeys end. What,<lb/>
and sit still when you are almost at your<lb/>
Journeys end! Some of you are old almost<lb/>
to a wonder. When a person begins<lb/>
to be going onwards to Eighty,<lb/>
People commonly wonder at their Age.<lb/>
What art thou such a one, yet delaying?<lb/>
Art thou Old to a wonder, and Wicked<lb/>
to a wonder too? O consider, it is but a<lb/>
little while that you have to stay in<lb/>
this World; make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> therefore, and<lb/>
do not delay.<lb/>
