                  <lb/>
           We use to end our Sermons with a Blessing,<lb/>
Christ begins his with the Beatitudes, and of<lb/>
the eight, my Text is neither the last nor the least,<lb/>
Blessed are the Peace-makers.<lb/>
5. Observe in the words the best <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> and the<lb/>
best wages; the best <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised>, Peace-makers: the best<lb/>
wages, They are blessed.<lb/>
I begin with the <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised>,<lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
which shall <normalised orig="imploy" auto="true">employ</normalised> my <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> and your attention<lb/>
this day. Now the <normalised orig="goodnesse" auto="true">goodness</normalised> of peace will the<lb/>
better <normalised orig="appeare" auto="true">appear</normalised>, if we consider the misery of <normalised orig="warre" auto="true">war</normalised>.<lb/>
It is said, Gen.12.11. <quote type="biblical" ana="Gen 12.11">And it came to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised> when Abraham<lb/>
was come <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> to enter into Egypt, that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised><lb/>
said unto Sarai his wife, Behold, now I know that thou<lb/>
art a <normalised orig="faire" auto="true">fair</normalised> woman to <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> upon.</quote> Why Now I know<lb/>
thou art a <normalised orig="beautifull" auto="true">beautiful</normalised> woman? Did Abraham live thus<lb/>
long in ignorance of his wives beauty? Did he now<lb/>
first begin to know her <normalised orig="handsomnesse" auto="false">handsomeness</normalised>? Learned<lb/>
Tremelius on the place starts and answers the objection:<lb/>
Now, that is, when Abraham came into Egypt,<lb/>
as if he had said, When I see the tawny faces<lb/>
and swarthy complexions of the sun-burnt Egyptians,<lb/>
thy face <normalised orig="seemeth" auto="true">seems</normalised> the fairer, and thy beauty<lb/>
the brighter in mine eyes. I must <normalised orig="confesse" auto="true">confess</normalised>, I ever<lb/>
prized peace for a <normalised orig="pearle" auto="true">pearl</normalised>; but we never did or could<lb/>
set the true estimate and value upon it till this interruption<lb/>
and suspension of it. Now we know, being<lb/>
taught by <normalised orig="deare" auto="true">dear</normalised> experience, that peace is a<lb/>
<normalised orig="beautifull" auto="true">beautiful</normalised> blessing: And therefore we will consider<lb/>
<normalised orig="warre" auto="true">war</normalised> first in the <normalised orig="wickednesse" auto="true">wickedness</normalised>, then in the <normalised orig="wofulnesse" auto="true">woefulness</normalised><lb/>
thereof.<lb/>
6 First, <normalised orig="warre" auto="true">war</normalised> makes a Nation more wicked.<lb/>
Surely, swearing and Sabbath breaking do not advance<lb/>
the keeping of the first Table. And as for<lb/>
the second Table, how hard is it in these distracted<lb/>
times to be practised? Yea, it is difficult to say the<lb/>
Lords Prayer, the Creed, or ten <normalised orig="Commandements" auto="true">Commandments</normalised>:<lb/>
The Lords Prayer for that Petition,<lb/>
And forgive us our trespasses, as wee forgive them<lb/>
that <normalised orig="trespasse" auto="true">trespass</normalised> against us. The Creed for that Article,<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
The Communion of Saints, which <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <normalised orig="tye" auto="true">tie</normalised> and<lb/>
<normalised orig="obliege" auto="false">oblige</normalised> us to the performance of all Christian offices<lb/>
&amp; charitable duties to those who by the same<lb/>
Christ <normalised orig="seekes" auto="true">seeks</normalised> salvation, and <normalised orig="professe" auto="true">profess</normalised> the same true<lb/>
Christian <normalised orig="Catholike" auto="true">Catholic</normalised> faith with us: The ten <normalised orig="Commandements" auto="true">Commandments</normalised><lb/>
for that precept, Thou shalt not kill: and<lb/>
though men in speculation and <normalised orig="schoole" auto="true">school</normalised> distinctions<lb/>
may say, that all these may be easily performed<lb/>
in the time of war; yet our corrupt nature, which<lb/>
is <normalised orig="starke" auto="true">stark</normalised> nought in time of peace, is likely to be far<lb/>
worse in <normalised orig="warre" auto="true">war</normalised>, and if these times continue, I am<lb/>
afraid wee shall neither say the Lords Prayer, nor<lb/>
<normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> the Creed, nor practise the <normalised orig="Commandements" auto="true">Commandments</normalised>.<lb/>
And as hard it will be preparedly and profitably<lb/>
to receive the Sacraments, when wee shall<lb/>
<normalised orig="drinke" auto="true">drink</normalised> Christs <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> as on to day, and go about to<lb/>
shed our brothers <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised> as on to morrow.<lb/>

                     <corr>we</corr>
                  </choice> now to consider what be the hindrances<lb/>
of Peace: these hindrances are either <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised><lb/>
or particular. The <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> hindrance is<lb/>
this: The many <normalised orig="nationall" auto="true">national</normalised> <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised> of our <normalised orig="kingdome" auto="true">kingdom</normalised><lb/>
being not repented of; I say of our <normalised orig="kingdome" auto="true">kingdom</normalised>, not<lb/>
of one Army alone. <normalised orig="Thinke" auto="true">Think</normalised> not that the Kings<lb/>
Army is like <normalised orig="Sodome" auto="true">Sodom</normalised>, not ten righteous men in it,<lb/>
(no not if righteous Lot <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> be put into the<lb/>
number) and the other Army like <normalised orig="Syon" auto="true">Zion</normalised> consisting<lb/>
all of Saints. No, there be drunkards on both<lb/>
sides, and swearers on both sides, and <normalised orig="whoremungers" auto="false">whoremonger</normalised><lb/>
on both sides, pious on both sides, and <normalised orig="prophane" auto="true">profane</normalised><lb/>
on both sides, like Jeremies <normalised orig="figges" auto="true">figs</normalised>, those that<lb/>
are good are very good, and those that are <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> are<lb/>
very <normalised orig="bad" auto="true">bade</normalised> in both parties. I never knew nor heard<lb/>
of an Army all of Saints, save the holy Army of<lb/>
Martyrs, and those, you know, were dead first, for<lb/>
the last breath they sent forth proclaimed them to<lb/>
be Martyrs. But it is not the <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised> of the Armies<lb/>
alone, but the <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised> of the whole <normalised orig="kingdome" auto="true">kingdom</normalised> which<lb/>
<normalised orig="breake" auto="true">break</normalised> off our hopes of Peace, our Nation is generally<lb/>
<normalised orig="sinfull" auto="true">sinful</normalised>. The City <normalised orig="complaines" auto="true">complains</normalised> of the ambition<lb/>

ingratitude of the Poor, the Poor <normalised orig="complaine" auto="true">complain</normalised> of<lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
the oppression and extortion of the Rich: Thus<lb/>
every one is more ready to throw <normalised orig="durt" auto="true">dirt</normalised> in <normalised orig="anothers" auto="true">another</normalised><lb/>
face then to <choice ana="illegible">

these though malice may set the varnish, sure<lb/>
truth <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> lay the <normalised orig="ground-worke" auto="false">ground-work</normalised>.<lb/>
21 Of particular hindrances, in the first place<lb/>
we may <normalised orig="ranke" auto="true">rank</normalised> the <normalised orig="Romish" auto="true">Roman</normalised> Recusants, <quote type="biblical" ana="2 Sam 14.19">Is not the<lb/>
hand of Joab with thee in all this</quote>, was Davids question<lb/>
2. Sam. 14. 19. but is not the hand may we all<lb/>
say of Jesvites in these distractions. Many times<lb/>
from my youth up have they fought against me may<lb/>
England now say, yea, many times from my youth up<lb/>
have they vexed me, but have not prevailed against<lb/>
me. At last, the Popish party perceived that the<lb/>
strength of England consisted in the unity thereof.<lb/>
(Sampson is <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> conquered when it is <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised><lb/>
where his strength <normalised orig="doth" auto="true">does</normalised> <normalised orig="lye" auto="true">lie</normalised>) and that it was impossible<lb/>
to conquer English Protestants, but by<lb/>
English Protestants. Is this your spite and malice<lb/>
O you <normalised orig="Romish" auto="true">Roman</normalised> adversaries, because you could not<lb/>
overcome us with Spanish Armadoes, nor <normalised orig="blowe" auto="true">blow</normalised><lb/>
us up with Gunpowder Treasons, nor <normalised orig="undoe" auto="true">undo</normalised> us<lb/>
with Irish Rebellions, to set our selves against our<lb/>
selves, first to divide us, then to destroy us. Well,<lb/>
God <normalised orig="knowes" auto="true">knows</normalised> what may come to <normalised orig="passe" auto="true">pass</normalised>. It may be<lb/>
when we have <normalised orig="drunke" auto="true">drunk</normalised> the top of this bitter cup,<lb/>
the dregs may be for your share, and we may all<lb/>
be made friends for your utter <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised> and destruction.<lb/>

30It <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been a great curse of God upon us,<lb/>

<normalised orig="levell" auto="false">level</normalised> at the same end. I cannot compare their<lb/>
case better than to the example of Ruben and Judah,<lb/>
Gen. 37. There Ruben desired and endeavoured<lb/>
to preserve the life of his brother Joseph,<lb/>
and Judah desired and endeavour to preserve the<lb/>
life of his brother Joseph; and yet these two <normalised orig="imbracing" auto="true">embracing</normalised><lb/>
different <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised>, did not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <normalised orig="crosse" auto="true">cross</normalised> and<lb/>
thwart, but even <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised> and destroy the desires of<lb/>
each other; for Ruben moved and obtained that<lb/>
Joseph might not be killed, <normalised orig="vers" auto="true">verse</normalised>. 22. <quote type="biblical" ana="Gen 37.22">And Ruben<lb/>
said unto them, shed no blood, but cast him into<lb/>
this Pit that is in the <normalised orig="wildernesse" auto="true">wilderness</normalised>, and lay no hand<lb/>
upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands,<lb/>
to deliver him to his Father <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>.</quote> Judah also desired<lb/>
the same; but being not <normalised orig="privie" auto="true">privy</normalised> to Rubens intents,<lb/>
and to avoid the cruelty of the rest of his<lb/>
Brethren, propounded and effected that Joseph<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="24">D2</fw>

                  <lb/>
might be sold to the Medianitish Merchants, <normalised orig="meerly" auto="true">merely</normalised><lb/>
so to preserve his life; and thereby he did <normalised orig="unravell" auto="true">unravel</normalised><lb/>
all the web of Rubins <normalised orig="designes" auto="true">designs</normalised>, and frustrated<lb/>
his endeavours. Thus when God will have<lb/>
a people punished for their <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised>, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">he</normalised> will not<lb/>
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> suffer but cause mistakes without mending,<lb/>

brethren who <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> and really intend the<lb/>

in effect, and yet, be Barbarians one to another,<lb/>
as either not or not right understanding what<lb/>
they say each to other.<lb/>

it is to be feared, that our breaches are too wide<lb/>

32 By Peace-makers, Peace-endeavourers are<lb/>

<normalised orig="Rom" auto="true">Room</normalised>.12.18 <quote type="biblical" ana="Rom 12.18">If it be possible, as much as in you <normalised orig="lyeth" auto="true">lies</normalised><lb/>

                  <lb/>
33And yet I am not out of heart, but that there<lb/>
is hope of Peace, and that as yet our <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised> are not<lb/>
<normalised orig="sweld" auto="true">swelled</normalised> so high, but that there is mercy with God<lb/>
for our nation. First, my hope is founded on the<lb/>
multitude of good people in this land, which assault<lb/>
and batter Heaven with the importunity<lb/>
of their prayers. We read of Ptolomeus Philadelphus,<lb/>
King of <normalised orig="Egipt" auto="true">Egypt</normalised> that he caused the Bible to be<lb/>
translated by seventy Interpreters, which seventy<lb/>
were severally disposed of in seventy <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> <normalised orig="Cels" auto="true">Cells</normalised>,<lb/>
unknown each to other; and yet they did so well agree<lb/>
in their several translations, that there was no<lb/>
considerable difference betwixt them, in rendering<lb/>
the text; an argument that they were acted with<lb/>
one and the same spirit. Surely it comforts me<lb/>
when I call to <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>, what shall I say, seventy,<lb/>
nay seven times seventy, yea seventy hundred,<lb/>
yea seventy thousand, which are peaceable in<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="26">D3</fw>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
Israel, which on the bended knees of their souls, daily<lb/>
pray to God for peace. These though they know<lb/>
not the faces, no not the names one of another,<lb/>
nay, have neither seen nor shall see one another till<lb/>
they meet together in <normalised orig="happinesse" auto="true">happiness</normalised> in Heaven; yet<lb/>
they unite their votes and centre their <normalised orig="suffrages" auto="true">sufferages</normalised><lb/>
in the same thing, that God would restore Peace<lb/>
unto us, who no doubt in his due time will <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised><lb/>
their prayers.<lb/>
