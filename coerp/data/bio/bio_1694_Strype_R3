THIS Rub of the Papal Power being now taken out of the<lb/>
way, and the King's Supremacy settled in the next Sessions of<lb/>
Parliament, in <normalised orig="Novemb" auto="true">November</normalised>. 1534. a Way was opened for a Reformation<lb/>
of Errors and Abuses in Religion. So that, as the Arch-bishop judged<lb/>
it a thing impossible to make any amendment of Religion under<lb/>
the Pope's Dominion; so he thought it now (the same being dispatched<lb/>
out of the Realm) a <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic><normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised>*</sic>
                     <corr>meet</corr>
                  </choice> time to restore the true Doctrine<lb/>
of Christ, according to the Word of God, and the old Primitive<lb/>
Church, within his Jurisdiction and Cure; and with the said Pope,<lb/>
to abolish also all false Doctrine, Errors and Heresies, by him brought<lb/>
into the Church; for the accomplishing of which he let pass no Opportunities.<lb/>
A Convocation now afforded him one. Our Arch-bishop, from<lb/>
his first entrance upon his Dignity, had it much in his mind to get<lb/>
the Holy Scriptures put into the Vulgar Language, and a Liberty for<lb/>
all to read them. The Convocation now was so well disposed, by the<lb/>
influence of the Arch-bishop and his Friends, that they did petition<lb/>
the King, that the Bible might be translated by some Learned Men<lb/>
of his <normalised orig="Highnesses" auto="false">Highnesse's</normalised> nomination. And as this good Motion was briefly<lb/>
made in the House by the Arch-bishop, so they agreed upon him to<lb/>
carry their Petition. But they clogged it with another, which the<lb/>
Arch-bishop did not so well approve of: For about the Month of December<lb/>
they <normalised orig="pass'd" auto="true">passed</normalised> this Order of Convocation. "The Bishops, Abbots,<lb/>
Priors of this Upper House of Convocation, of the Province<lb/>
of Canterbury, met together in the Chapter-House of St. Paul;<lb/>
unanimously did consent, that the most Reverend Father the<lb/>
Arch-bishop, should make instance in their Names to the King,<lb/>
that his Majesty would vouchsafe, for the <normalised orig="encrease" auto="true">increase</normalised> of the Faith of<lb/>
his Subjects, for decree and command, That all his Subjects, in<lb/>
whose possession any Books of suspect Doctrine were, especially in<lb/>
the Vulgar Language, imprinted, beyond or on this side the Sea,<lb/>
should be warned, within three Months, to bring them in before<lb/>
Persons to be appointed by the King, under a certain Pain to be limited<lb/>
by the King.<lb/>
And that moreover his Majesty would vouchsafe to decree, that<lb/>
the Scriptures should be translated into the Vulgar Tongue, by some<lb/>
honest and learned Men, to be nominated by the King, and to be<lb/>
delivered unto the People according to their Learning." This was<lb/>
resolved in the Convocation, <normalised orig="Decemb" auto="true">December</normalised>. 19.<lb/>
Accordingly the King issued out soon after his Proclamation.<lb/>
What this Proclamation was I do not know, unless it were one I meet<lb/>
with about this time, against bringing in, or printing seditious Books<lb/>
of <notvariant>Anabaptists</notvariant> and <notvariant>Sacramentaries</notvariant>, who were said to be lately come<lb/>
into the Realm: and against some of his own Subjects, who <normalised orig="publickly" auto="true">publicly</normalised><lb/>
disputed in Taverns and other open Places, upon those Points of<lb/>
Religion, which the King was offended withal. For the Correction<lb/>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
and Regulating of which, the King in the said Proclamation commanded<lb/>
sundry Articles to be observed; which for the length of<lb/>
them I have put into the Appendix. Unless perhaps this Proclamation<lb/>
may belong to the Year 1538.<lb/>
About the month of June of this Year, was a Book drawn up for<lb/>
Bishops and Priests, wherein was an Order for preaching; and in<lb/>
the same were Forms devised for the Beads, as well for Preachers,<lb/>
as Curates. In which Forms the King's Title of <normalised orig="Supream" auto="true">Supreme</normalised> Head was<lb/>
specified. In this Book was commandment given by the King, that<lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*very</sic>
                     <corr>every</corr>
                  </choice> Preacher should, before Easter, once in solemn Audience, <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>de*are</sic>
                     <corr>declare</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
the usurped Jurisdiction, within this Realm, of the Bishop of<lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*<notvariant>ome</notvariant></sic>
                     <corr>Rome</corr>
                  </choice>, and the King's just Cause to decline from the same: and also<lb/>
to open and declare such things as might avow and justify the King's<lb/>
refusal of Marriage with the Princess Dowager, and his contract<lb/>
anew with Queen Ann. And also in the same Book an Order was<lb/>
given for the suppression of the General Sentence or Curse. This<lb/>
Book the Arch-bishop, who we may well suppose had a great hand<lb/>
in it, sent, by the King's Commandment, to all the Bishops, and<lb/>
so the Arch-bishop of York, though out of his Province: that <join original="Arch-&lt;lb/&gt;[lb][lb][lb]bishop">Archbishop</join> lying under some Jealousy as it seems with the King.<lb/>
Therefore after the <normalised orig="receit" auto="true">receipt</normalised> of the Book, the said Arch-bishop of<lb/>
York the next Sunday, which was the second Sunday after Trinity,<lb/>
went from <notvariant>Cawood</notvariant> to York, and there in his own Person declared,<lb/>
as well the King's Cause touching the Matrimony, as his refusal of<lb/>
the Pope's Jurisdiction, so fully, that nothing that needed to be opened<lb/>
was left unspoken, as that Arch-bishop wrote himself to the<lb/>
King in his own Vindication. And that the Auditory might be the<lb/>
greater, he sent to York forthwith, upon the <normalised orig="receit" auto="true">receipt</normalised> of the Book, to<lb/>
publish there, that he would be there the next Sunday following,<lb/>
and caused the Churches to make an end of their Service in such<lb/>
time, as every Man might have opportunity to be at the Sermon:<lb/>
and especially required the Mayor and his Brethren, and one<lb/>
Mr. <notvariant>Magnus</notvariant>, and Sir George Lawson, his Majesty's Chaplains to be<lb/>
there: And a very great Confluence there was. Then the <join original="Arch-&lt;lb/&gt;[lb][lb][lb]bishop">Archbishop</join> preached from that Text, <quote type="biblical" ana="Lk 14.20">
                     <lb/>
                     <notvariant>Uxorem</notvariant> <notvariant>duxi</notvariant>, &amp;c.
                     <lb/>
                  </quote> Whence he<lb/>
took occasion to utter, and declare both his <normalised orig="foresaid" auto="false">aforesaid</normalised> Matters, and<lb/>
the Injury done to the King's Highness by Pope Clement.<lb/>
As the Convocation this Year had declared the Pope to have no<lb/>
Jurisdiction in this Kingdom, so this would not serve the King, till<lb/>
all the Learned and Spiritual Men in England had subscribed to it<lb/>
with their Hands. The Arch-bishop's Church of Canterbury began.<lb/>
For the Prior and Convent thereof, moved and influenced not a<lb/>
little by their Diocesan, solemnly subscribed an Instrument for abolishing<lb/>
the Pope's Supremacy, and for acknowledgment of the King<lb/>
<normalised orig="Supream" auto="true">Supreme</normalised> Head of the Church of England under this Position.<lb/>

<notvariant>Episcopus</notvariant>. That is,<lb/>

                  <fw type="pageNum" n="26">E</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
That the Bishop of Rome <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> not some greater Jurisdiction conferred<lb/>
upon him by God in this Realm of England, than any other Foreign<lb/>
Bishop.<lb/>
This was consented to by the <notvariant>Prior's</notvariant> own Hand subscribed, and<lb/>
sixty nine of the Convent besides. The Original whereof is in a<lb/>
Volume of the Cotton Library. In another place of the same Volume<lb/>
is extant the Subscription of the Bishops, Deans, and several<lb/>
Abbots; and after that, of the University of Oxford, and all the<lb/>
particular Colleges : and after that, the Names of all the subscribing<lb/>
Priors of England.<lb/>
The Arch-bishop was one employed about the Act of Succession,<lb/>
that was made the last Sessions of Parliament : which was to invest<lb/>
the Succession to the Crown upon the Heirs of Q. Ann; and that<lb/>
Q. <notvariant>Katharine</notvariant> should be no more called Queen, but Princess Dowager.<lb/>
In the Preamble to the Act, there were certain Touches against the<lb/>
Pope's Supremacy, and against his Power of dispensing in the<lb/>
King's former Marriage with his Brother's Wife, carnally known by<lb/>
him. To this Act all Persons were to swear, to accept and maintain<lb/>
the same, upon pain of Treason. The Arch-bishop of Canterbury,<lb/>
the <notvariant>Ld</notvariant> Chancellor <notvariant>Audley</notvariant>, Secretary <normalised orig="Crumwel" auto="false">Cromwell</normalised>, the Abbot of<lb/>
Westminster, and others, were the King's Commissioners appointed<lb/>
to tender this Oath. The Nobility and Gentry took it, none denying,<lb/>
to which they set their Hands in a long List.<lb/>
On the 13th of April, the Commissioners sat at Lambeth to receive<lb/>
the Oaths of the Clergy, and chiefly those of London, that had not<lb/>
yet sworn; who all took it, not one excepted. And a certain<lb/>
Doctor, Vicar of <notvariant>Croyden</notvariant>, that it seems made some boggle before<lb/>
went up with the rest: of whom Sir Thomas More, who then stood<lb/>
by, made an Observation, how, as he past, he went to my Lord's<lb/>
Buttery-hatch, and called for Drink, and drank <notvariant>valde</notvariant> <notvariant>familiariter</notvariant>; whether, saith he sarcastically, it were for Gladness, or <normalised orig="Driness" auto="true">Dryness</normalised>, or<lb/>
                  <notvariant>Quod</notvariant> <notvariant>ille</notvariant> <notvariant>notus</notvariant> <notvariant>erat</notvariant> <notvariant>Pontifici</notvariant>. The Oath also now was taken by<lb/>
Dr. <notvariant>Wylson</notvariant>, a great Court-Divine in those Days, who for Queen<lb/>
<notvariant>Katharine's</notvariant> Business was a Prisoner at this time, though a great while<lb/>
he was unsatisfied, and consulted much with Sir Thomas More about<lb/>
the Lawfulness of taking it.<lb/>
The same Day were conveyed hither from the Tower, Bishop<lb/>
Fisher, and Sir Thomas More, the only Layman at this Meeting, to<lb/>
tender this Oath to them. Who both, being separately called, refused<lb/>
it. After the Clergy were sworn and dispatched, immediately<lb/>
Sir Thomas by himself was sent for the second time. Now<lb/>
he had much talk with the Lords, who would fain have<lb/>
brought him to comply. They urged him to declare the Causes<lb/>
why he would not Swear: But he excused his so doing.<lb/>
Then they charged him with Obstinacy: He said, it was not<lb/>
Obstinacy, but because he might not declare his Mind without<lb/>
peril of incurring the King's further Displeasure. He told the<lb/>
Commissioners, that for his part he condemned not the Consciences<lb/>
of any; but that he was dissatisfied in his own Conscience for certain<lb/>
Reasons. The Arch-bishop taking hold of this, <normalised orig="spake" auto="false">spoke</normalised> to him<lb/>
thus, "That it appeared well, that Sir Thomas did not take it for a<lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
very sure thing and a certain, that he might not lawfully swear,<lb/>
but rather as a thing uncertain and doubtful. But you know,<lb/>
said my Lord, for a certainty, and for a thing without doubt,<lb/>
that you be bound to obey your <normalised orig="Soveraign" auto="true">Sovereign</normalised> Lord the King. And<lb/>
therefore are you bound to leave off the doubt of your unsure<lb/>
Conscience, in refusing the Oath, and take the sure way in obeying<lb/>
of your Prince who commands you to Swear." This Argument,<lb/>
as Sir Thomas confessed in one of his Letters to his Daughter<lb/>
<notvariant>Roper</notvariant>, seemed so <normalised orig="subtil" auto="true">subtle</normalised>, and with such Authority coming out<lb/>
of so Noble a Prelate's Mouth, that he could answer again nothing<lb/>
thereto: but only that he thought with himself, that he might not<lb/>
so do, because that in his Conscience this was one of the Causes in<lb/>
which he was bounden, that he should not obey his Prince; <notvariant>sith</notvariant><lb/>
that whatsoever other Folks thought in the Matter, (whose Conscience<lb/>
or Learning, as he said, he would not condemn, or take upon<lb/>
him to <normalised orig="judg" auto="true">judge</normalised>) yet in his Conscience the Truth seemed on the other<lb/>
Side, wherein he had informed his Conscience neither suddenly<lb/>
nor slightly, but by long leisure and diligent search for the Matter.<lb/>
In fine, the farthest Sir Thomas could be brought, and which he<lb/>
offered voluntarily that Morning, was to swear to the Succession,<lb/>
(which was the main Design of the Act) though not to the Preamble.<lb/>
At parting the Lord Chancellor <normalised orig="bad" auto="false">bade</normalised> the Secretary, before More,<lb/>
take notice, that More denied not, but was content to swear the<lb/>
Succession. More assented and said, in that Point he would be contented,<lb/>
so that he might see the Oath so framed, as might stand<lb/>
with his Conscience.<lb/>
Fisher Bishop of Rochester, offered the same before this Assembly,<lb/>
that More had done: and in a Letter of his afterwards writ to the Secretary,<lb/>
assigned the Reason why he could, with a good Conscience,<lb/>
swear to the Succession, viz. because he doubted not but that the<lb/>
Prince of a Realm, with the Assent of the Nobles and Commons,<lb/>
might appoint his Successors according as he pleased. In the Appendix<lb/>
this Letter will be found, which Bishop Fisher writ upon occasion<lb/>
of the Secretary's Advice, who laboured to gain him, that he should<lb/>
write to the King, to declare his Mind to him in swearing to the Succession;<lb/>
and to petition him to let that suffice, because his Conscience<lb/>
could not consent to the rest of the Act. The Secretary also<lb/>
had sent unto Fisher, lying in the Tower, Lee Bishop Elect of <notvariant>Lichfield</notvariant><lb/>
and Coventry; to whom he declared again, that he would take<lb/>
the Oath to the Succession; and moreover, that he would swear never<lb/>
to meddle more in Disputation of the Matrimony, and promised<lb/>
all Allegiance to the King. But he told Lee, his Conscience could<lb/>
not be convinced, that the Marriage was against the Law of God,<lb/>
because of a Prohibition in the <notvariant>Levitical</notvariant> Law. See Lee's Letter, in<lb/>
the Appendix, to Secretary <normalised orig="Crumwel" auto="false">Cromwell</normalised>.<lb/>
The Arch-bishop, soon after that meeting of the Commissioners at<lb/>
Lambeth, retired to Croydon: And being a Man not kind to his own<lb/>
Party and <normalised orig="Perswasion" auto="true">Persuasion</normalised> only, and fierce and bloody-minded to them<lb/>
that differed from him, but compassionate towards all, Friend and<lb/>
Foe; his tender Spirit suggested to him, to make this serve for an<lb/>
Occasion to intercede for More and Fisher, to <normalised orig="Crumwel" auto="false">Cromwell</normalised>; <normalised orig="shewing" auto="true">showing</normalised> him<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="28">E2</fw>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
in a Letter, dated April the 17<hi rend="high">th</hi>, how <normalised orig="adviseable" auto="true">advisable</normalised> in his Judgment it<lb/>
would be to be satisfied with that Oath they had offered to swear, in<lb/>
case they would swear to maintain the said Succession against all<lb/>
Power and Potentates: Urging to him that there would be these Advantages<lb/>
gained thereby. First, That it would be a means to satisfy<lb/>
the Consciences of the Princess Dowager and the Lady Mary; who<lb/>
it seems made it a Matter of Conscience and Sin to abandon their<lb/>
Titles. Also, that it might tend to stop the Emperor's Mouth, and<lb/>
the Mouths of other their Friends, when Fisher and More, who had<lb/>
<notvariant>stickled</notvariant> so much for them, should now own that Succession, which<lb/>
would be in effect a disowning of them. Secondly, That it might<lb/>
be a means to resolve and quiet also many others in the Realm that<lb/>
were in doubt, when such great Men should affirm by Oath and Subscription,<lb/>
that the Succession mentioned in the said Act was good, and<lb/>
according to God's Laws. And he thought, that after two such had<lb/>
sworn, there would be scarce one in the Kingdom would reclaim against<lb/>
it. And thirdly, That though a great many in the Realm<lb/>
could not be brought to alter from their Opinions of the Validity of<lb/>
the King's former Marriage, and of the Bishop of <notvariant>Rome's</notvariant> Authority,<lb/>
that it would be a great Point gained, if all with one accord would<lb/>
own and <normalised orig="acknowledg" auto="true">acknowledge</normalised> the Succession.<lb/>
Weaver, the Author of the Funeral Monuments, transcribed this<lb/>
Letter out of the Cotton Library, and inserted it into his said Book:<lb/>
and the thing he takes notice of therein, is the Wisdom and Policy of<lb/>
the prudent Arch-bishop. I shall take notice of another thing, and which<lb/>
I suppose was the great Cause that employed his Pen at this time,<lb/>
namely, his tender Heart, and abhorrence from Blood-shedding:<lb/>
Propounding these <normalised orig="Politick" auto="true">Politic</normalised> Considerations to the Secretary, which<lb/>
were the properest Arguments to be used with a Statesman, and for<lb/>
him to use and urge before the King; that so he might be an Instrument<lb/>
of saving the Lives of these Men, however they differed from<lb/>
him, and it may be were none of his very good Friends. This Letter<lb/>
of the Arch-bishop's, as I my self took it from the Original, I<lb/>
thought worthy depositing among <notvariant>Cranmer's</notvariant> Monuments in the Appendix.<lb/>
But this Offer of theirs, notwithstanding the Arch-bishop's<lb/>
Arguments and Endeavours, would not be accepted. The King<lb/>
would not be satisfied with this Swearing by halves.<lb/>

HAving brought the Arch-bishop unto his Degradation and Appeal,<lb/>
wherein he <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> so much Christian Courage, Wisdom<lb/>
and Fortitude, I must now represent him making a great Trip and a<lb/>
sad Fall; and mention one of the greatest Blemishes of his Life.<lb/>
For now the <notvariant>Popish</notvariant> Party, thinking what a piece of Glory it would<lb/>
be, to gain this great Man to their Church, used all Means, all Arts,<lb/>
as well as Arguments, to bring him to recant. They set the Doctors<lb/>
of the University upon him. He was entertained at the Dean of<lb/>
Christs-Church his Lodging: There they treated him with good Fare.<lb/>
They got him to Bowls with them. They let him have his Pleasure<lb/>
in taking the Air. Sometimes they accosted him with Arguments<lb/>
and Disputations: Sometimes by <notvariant>Flatteries</notvariant>, Promises and <normalised orig="Threatnings" auto="true">Threatenings</normalised>.<lb/>
They told him, "The Noble-men bare him good Will: that<lb/>
his Return would be highly acceptable to the King and Queen.<lb/>
That he should enjoy his former Dignity in the Church; or if it<lb/>
liked him better, he should lead a quiet Life in more privacy.<lb/>
And that it was but setting his Name in two Words in a piece of<lb/>
Paper. They told him, the Queen was resolved to have <notvariant>Cranmer</notvariant><lb/>
a <normalised orig="Catholick" auto="true">Catholic</normalised>, or no <notvariant>Cranmer</notvariant> at all. That he was still lusty and<lb/>
strong, and might live many a Year more, if he would not willingly<lb/>
cut off his own Life by the terrible Death of Burning." He<lb/>
rejected these Temptations a long while, but at last was overcome<lb/>
and yielded. The Recantation I shall not repeat, it being to be seen<lb/>
at large in Fox. It was signed by his Hand. The Witnesses <notvariant>thereunto</notvariant><lb/>
were two or three, who had been exceedingly busy in tampering<lb/>
with him: One <notvariant>Sydal</notvariant>, (a great Professor in the last Reign)<lb/>
and John and Richard two Spanish Friars.<lb/>
The Doctors and <notvariant>Prelats</notvariant> caused this Recantation speedily to be<lb/>
printed and dispersed. When the Queen saw his Subscription, she<lb/>
was glad of it, but would not alter her Determination to have him<lb/>
burned, by the instigation, as I suppose, of Pole the <normalised orig="Legat" auto="true">Legate</normalised>. The<lb/>
Writ for which was sent down by <normalised orig="Hethe" auto="true">Heath</normalised>, Lord Chancellor, in the<lb/>
latter end of February, under the Broad Seal. It was charged upon<lb/>
his Converters, that they were negligent in procuring his Life<lb/>
from the Queen: But the true Reason was, the Queen was resolved<lb/>
not to grant it. She privately gave Instruction to Cole, to prepare a<lb/>
Sermon to preach at his Burning: And several Lords, and other Justices<lb/>
of the Peace in those Parts, were ordered to attend there, with<lb/>
their Servants and Retinue, to keep Peace, and to see him Executed.<lb/>
Cole coming with his Errand to <notvariant>Oxon</notvariant>, visited him in the Prison, and<lb/>
asked him if he stood firm to what he had subscribed ? This was the<lb/>
Day before his Execution, but saying nothing to him of his determined<lb/>
Death. The next Day, being the Day he was to be burned,<lb/>
viz. March 21. he came again, and asked him if he had any<lb/>
Money ? And having none, he gave him certain Crowns to bestow<lb/>
to what Poor he would; and so departed, exhorting him to Constancy.<lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
But the disconsolate Arch-bishop perceived to what this<lb/>
tended: and being by and by to be brought to S. <notvariant>Mary's</notvariant> (where Cole<lb/>
was to preach) there openly to confess what he had more privately<lb/>
subscribed, he resolved with himself to <notvariant>disburden</notvariant> his Conscience,<lb/>
and to revoke his Recantation. And he prepared a Prayer, and a<lb/>
Declaration of his Faith, which he drew up in writing, and carried<lb/>
it privately along with him, to make use of it when he saw his Occasion.<lb/>
The manner how he behaved himself after <notvariant>Cole's</notvariant> Sermon,<lb/>
and how he delivered his last Mind, and with what Bitterness and<lb/>
Tears he did it; and how he was pulled down by the Scholars,<lb/>
Priests and Friars, with the greatest Indignation at this their<lb/>
Disappointment; and how he was led out of the Church forthwith<lb/>
to the Place of Burning, over against <notvariant>Baliol</notvariant> College: and how he<lb/>
there first put his right Hand into the Flames to be consumed, for that<lb/>
base Subscription that it made; and how his Heart was found whole<lb/>
and <notvariant>unconsumed</notvariant> in the Ashes, after he was burnt; These, and the<lb/>
rest of the Particulars of his Martyrdom, I might leave to Fox, and<lb/>
other Historians from him, to relate.<lb/>

               <head>Some Observations upon Arch-bishop <notvariant>Cranmer</notvariant>.</head>
               <p>
                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>
BEsides these Observations, made to my Hand by another, of<lb/>
this great Arch-bishop, I shall gather some further Observations<lb/>
of his Endowments and Qualities, whether Christian or Moral.<lb/>
Whereby we shall have occasion offered us, of gathering up a few<lb/>
more Memorials of him.<lb/>
He was a most profound Learned Man in Divinity, as also in the<lb/>
Civil and Canon Laws. As appeared by those many voluminous<lb/>
Writings and Common-places, by him devised or collected out of<lb/>
all the Fathers, and Church-Writers: which Peter Martyr reported<lb/>
he himself saw; and were indeed communicated to him by the<lb/>
Arch-bishop, while he harboured him at Lambeth. And there was<lb/>
no Book, either of the <normalised orig="Antient" auto="true">Ancient</normalised> or Modern Writers, especially upon<lb/>
the Point of the <notvariant>Eucharist</notvariant>, which he had not noted with his own<lb/>
Hand in the most remarkable Places. No Councils, Canons, Decrees<lb/>
of Popes, which he had not read and well considered. And<lb/>
from this his indefatigable Reading, and exact <normalised orig="Knowledg" auto="true">Knowledge</normalised> of Authors,<lb/>
he ventured <normalised orig="publickly" auto="true">publicly</normalised>, before the Pope's Delegate, and Queen <notvariant>Mary's</notvariant><lb/>
Commissioners to make this Challenge, "That if it could be proved<lb/>
by any Doctor above a thousand Years after Christ, that Christ's<lb/>
Body is in the Sacrament of the Altar really, he would give over."<lb/>
So that his Library was the Storehouse of Ecclesiastical Writers of<lb/>
all Ages. And which was open for the use of Learned Men.<lb/>
Here old <notvariant>Latimer</notvariant> spent many an Hour; and found some Books so remarkable,<lb/>
that once he thought fit to mention one in a Sermon before<lb/>
the King. And when <notvariant>Ascham</notvariant> of <normalised orig="Cambridg" auto="false">Cambridge</normalised>, a great Student of<lb/>
Politer Learning, and of Greek Authors, wanted Gregory <notvariant>Nyssen</notvariant> in<lb/>
Greek, (not the Latin Translation of him) and which it seems the<lb/>
University could not afford, he earnestly entreated <notvariant>Poynet</notvariant> his Grace's<lb/>
Chaplain, to borrow it in his Name, and for his use, for some<lb/>
Months of the Arch-bishop. For in those Times it was rare to meet<lb/>
with those Greek Fathers in their own Language, and not spoiled by<lb/>
some ill Latin Translation. Another of his Books I will mention, because<lb/>
it is now in the possession of a Reverend Friend of mine near<lb/>
Canterbury: in which Book the Arch-bishop's Name is yet to be seen,<lb/>
written thus with his own Hand, Thomas <notvariant>Cantuariensis</notvariant>; and a remarkable<lb/>
Book it is, which we may conclude, the Arch-bishop often<lb/>
perused, viz. <notvariant>Epistola</notvariant> &amp; <notvariant>Historiae</notvariant> <notvariant>Joannis</notvariant> <notvariant>Hus</notvariant>. Printed at <notvariant>Wittemberg</notvariant>,<lb/>
1537.<lb/>
And this Learning happening in a Mind possessed with Piety,<lb/>
made him the more deeply sensible of the greatness of the Charge,<lb/>
that lay upon him. And as he well knew under what Needs the<lb/>
Church laboured, so he was very solicitous, that nothing might be<lb/>
wanting on his part: <normalised orig="shewing" auto="true">showing</normalised> himself a most conscientious Bishop,<lb/>
and tender Pastor of Christ's Flock. He was not guided in his Episcopal<lb/>
Function by vain Glory, or Affectation of popular Applause, or<lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
worldly Ambition, or Covetousness, but only by the Holy and Pious<lb/>
Ends, of discharging his Duty, and promoting the Honour of<lb/>
Christ, and the <normalised orig="Knowledg" auto="true">Knowledge</normalised> of his Gospel, and the Good of his People:<lb/>
as he took God to witness in the Preface of his Book of the Sacrament.<lb/>
A Paragraph whereof I think not unworthy to be here<lb/>
inserted, whereby it may appear of what a truly <notvariant>Apostolical</notvariant> Spirit<lb/>
our Arch-bishop was. "When I see, said he, Christ's <normalised orig="Vinyard" auto="false">Vineyard</normalised><lb/>
overgrown with Thorns, Brambles and Weeds, I know that everlasting<lb/>
Woe <normalised orig="appertaineth" auto="true">appertains</normalised> to me, if I hold my Peace, and put not<lb/>
to my Hand and Tongue, to labour in purging his <normalised orig="Vinyard" auto="false">Vineyard</normalised>. God<lb/>
I take to witness, who <normalised orig="seeth" auto="true">sees</normalised> the Hearts of all Men <normalised orig="thorowly" auto="true">thoroughly</normalised> unto<lb/>
the bottom, that I take this Labour for none other Consideration,<lb/>
but for the Glory of his Name, and the Discharge of my Duty,<lb/>
and the Zeal I have toward the Flock of Christ. I know in what<lb/>
Office God <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> placed me, and to what Purpose. That is to say,<lb/>
to set forth his Word truly unto his People, to the uttermost of<lb/>
my Power, without respect of Persons, or regard of Things in<lb/>
the World, but of him alone. I know what Account I shall make<lb/>
to him hereof at the last Day, when every Man shall answer for<lb/>
his Vocation, and receive for the same, Good or Evil, according<lb/>
as he <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> done. I know how <notvariant>Antichrist</notvariant> <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> obscured the Glory of<lb/>
God, and the true <normalised orig="Knowledg" auto="true">Knowledge</normalised> of his Word, overcasting the same<lb/>
with Mists and Clouds of Error and Ignorance, <normalised orig="thrô" auto="true">through</normalised> false Glosses<lb/>
and Interpretations. It <normalised orig="pitieth" auto="false">pitied</normalised> me to see the simple and hungry<lb/>
Flock of Christ, led into corrupt Pastures, to be carried blindfold<lb/>
they know not whither, and to be fed with Poison, instead of<lb/>
wholesome Meats. And moved by the Duty, Office and Place,<lb/>
whereunto it <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> pleased God to call me, I give warning in his<lb/>
Name unto all that profess Christ, that they flee far from <notvariant>Babylon</notvariant>,<lb/>
if they will save their Souls, and to beware of that great Harlot,<lb/>
that is to say, the <notvariant>pestiferous</notvariant> See of Rome, that she make you not<lb/>
drunk with her pleasant Wine, &amp;c."<lb/>
And as he had this Care of the whole Church of this Land, as the<lb/>
high Patriarch thereof, so he particularly had his Eye upon his own<lb/>
<normalised orig="Diocess" auto="true">Diocese</normalised>. He took Care, even in King <notvariant>Henry's</notvariant> ticklish Reign, to<lb/>
place such Ministers in Kent, as were Learned, and dared to open<lb/>
their Mouths to preach <normalised orig="Gospel-Doctrin" auto="false">gospel-doctrine</normalised>, and to convince the People<lb/>
of the <notvariant>Usurpations</notvariant> of the Bishop of Rome, and of the Idolatry and<lb/>
Superstitions, wherein they had been so long <notvariant>nursled</notvariant> up. And for<lb/>
the preventing whereof, for Time to come, he ordered his Arch-deacon,<lb/>
and other his Officers, to take down Images out of Churches,<lb/>
and deface them. Which things created him much hatred among<lb/>
the <notvariant>Popish</notvariant> Clergy, whose Gain depended for much therein. He had<lb/>
a peculiar regard of the greater Towns of his <normalised orig="Diocess" auto="true">Diocese</normalised>, that such<lb/>
Places might be furnished with able Men, where the Inhabitants<lb/>
were numerous, and the Salaries generally small. Whereby he saw<lb/>
it came to pass, that where there was most need of Learned Men,<lb/>
There the most Ignorant were placed. Therefore he thought this<lb/>
worthy his redressing. I meet with this Memorandum in one of his<lb/>
Note-books: "These Towns following are especially to be <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised>:<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="441">440</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
that in them there be placed Learned Men, with sufficient<lb/>
Stipends."<lb/>
                  <lb/>
Sandwich, <notvariant>Ashford</notvariant>, <notvariant>Faversham</notvariant>, <notvariant>Marden</notvariant>,<lb/>
Dover, <notvariant>Tenderden</notvariant>, <normalised orig="Hearn" auto="true">Heron</normalised>, <notvariant>Maydston</notvariant>,<lb/>
<notvariant>Folkston</notvariant>, <notvariant>Crambroke</notvariant>, <notvariant>Whitstable</notvariant>, <notvariant>Wye</notvariant> and <notvariant>Wingham</notvariant>.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
In these great Towns, as well as Canterbury, he often preached<lb/>
himself. And for his Sermons at Sandwich, he was once complained<lb/>
of openly in the Parliament-house, to have brought him under the<lb/>
Lash of the Statute of the Six Articles. And within seven or eight<lb/>
Years, after his first entrance into the See, he had placed such store<lb/>
of good Preachers about Kent, that at another time, a long List of<lb/>
Articles were drawn up against them, and given in to the Justices of<lb/>
the County at a Quarter-Sessions of the Peace; and they by a Combination<lb/>
preferred the Complaint to the King and Council.<lb/>
His high Estate puffed him not up, nor made him forget the great<lb/>
Work of his Calling; which he very earnestly desired to prosecute<lb/>
above all things in the World. Nor did he care at all for the high<lb/>
Titles that were attributed to him; as he was Arch-bishop of Canterbury,<lb/>
as may appear by this Passage. Upon occasion of a Question<lb/>
arising concerning his Stile of Primate of all England, for bearing<lb/>
which, in his Summons for a Provincial Visitation, the Bishop of Winchester<lb/>
out of Malice, had complained to King Henry against him, as<lb/>
though it were in Encroachment upon the King's Supremacy; he<lb/>
protested to <normalised orig="Crumwel" auto="false">Cromwell</normalised>, then Secretary, (who had sent him word of<lb/>
it) "That as God should be merciful to him in the Day of Judgment,<lb/>
he set not more by any Title or Stile, than he did by the paring<lb/>
of an Apple, further than it should be to the setting forth God's<lb/>
Word and Will. His Expression was, That they were the Successors<lb/>
of <notvariant>Diotrephes</notvariant>, that affected glorious Titles, Stiles and <notvariant>Pomps</notvariant>."<lb/>
He professed, "He could have been willing that Bishops should lay<lb/>
aside their lofty Stiles, and only write themselves by the Stile of<lb/>
their Offices; The Apostles of Jesus Christ. And wished heartily,<lb/>
that the Christian Conversation of the People, were the Letters<lb/>
and Seals of their Offices, (as the <notvariant>Corinthians</notvariant> were to St. Paul,<lb/>
who told them, that They were his Letters, and the Signs of his<lb/>
<notvariant>Apostleship</notvariant>) and not Paper, Parchment, Lead or Wax."<lb/>
