The Warrant was in the Name of three Justices, to Summon<lb/>
him to Appear forthwith at one of their Houses, which<lb/>
was about two Mile from the Town, but he desired liberty to<lb/>
stay and Sup with his Family first, supposing his Entertainment<lb/>
there would be such as would <choice ana="typeset-error">

This would not be granted, till one of the Chief of the Town<lb/>
was bound for his speedy Appearance: His Supper being prepared,<lb/>
he sat down eating very heartily, and was very <normalised orig="chearful" auto="true">cheerful</normalised>,<lb/>
but full of holy and gracious Expressions, <normalised orig="sutable" auto="true">suitable</normalised> to his<lb/>

he with the Officer, and two or three Friends accompanying<lb/>
him, repaired to the Justice's House, where they lay to his<lb/>
Charge, that he had broken the Act of Uniformity by his<lb/>
Preaching; which he denied, saying: That he had Preached<lb/>
neither in any Church, nor <normalised orig="Chappel" auto="true">Chapel</normalised>, nor place of <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Worship,<lb/>
since the 24th. of August, and what he did was in his own<lb/>

pretended to be struck into any man, nor any other Business<lb/>
met about, then Preaching and Prayer. Here he was much<lb/>

often Rogue, and told him he deserved to be Hanged, and if<lb/>
he were not, he should be Hanged for him: With many such<lb/>
like Scurrilous passages, which my Husband received with<lb/>
much Patience, and seeming, as they apprehended by his Countenance,<lb/>
to slight their <normalised orig="Threatnings" auto="true">Threatenings</normalised>; they were more <normalised orig="Inraged" auto="true">Enraged</normalised><lb/>
at him, they urged him much to Accuse himself, which they<lb/>
seeing they could not bring him to; and having no Evidence<lb/>
as appeared after: Yet did make his <notvariant>Mittimus</notvariant> for to go to the<lb/>
Goal on Monday Morning, after they had detained him till<lb/>
Twelve at Night, abusing him beyond what I do now distinctly<lb/>
remember, or were fit to Express.<lb/>
<normalised orig="Assoon" auto="true">As soon</normalised> as he returned, it being so late about two a Clock,<lb/>
he lay down on the Bed in his <notvariant>Clothes'</notvariant> where he had not<lb/>
slept above two or three Hours at the most, but he was up,<lb/>
spending his time in Converse with God, till about Eight a<lb/>
Clock; by which Hour, several of his Friends were come to<lb/>
Visit him: But he was so watched, and the Officer had such<lb/>
a charge, that he was not suffered to Preach all that Sabbath,<lb/>
but spent the day in discoursing with the various <normalised orig="Companys" auto="true">Companies</normalised>,<lb/>
that came flocking in from the Town, and Villages, to Visit<lb/>
him; Praying often with them, as he could be permitted.<lb/>
He was exceeding <normalised orig="chearful" auto="true">cheerful</normalised> in his Spirit, full of <notvariant>Admirations</notvariant><lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Mercys" auto="true">Mercies</normalised> of God, and <normalised orig="incouraging" auto="true">encouraging</normalised> all that came to be<lb/>
bold, and venture for the Gospel, and their Souls; notwithstanding<lb/>
what was come upon him for their sakes: For as he<lb/>
told them, he was not at all moved at it, nor did not in the<lb/>
least repent of any thing he had done, but accounted himself<lb/>
happy, and under that Promise Christ makes to his, in the<lb/>
5th. of Matthew, that he should be doubly and <normalised orig="trebly" auto="false">triply</normalised> blessed<lb/>
now he was to suffer for his sake: And was very earnest with<lb/>
his Brethren in the Ministry, that came to see him, that<lb/>
they would not in the least desist when he was gone, that<lb/>
there might not be one Sermon the less in Taunton; and with<lb/>

the People to attend the Ministry with greater <notvariant>Ardency</notvariant>, <notvariant>Diligency</notvariant>,<lb/>
and Courage, than before; assuring them how<lb/>
sweet and comfortable it was to him, to consider what he<lb/>
had done for God, in the Months past: And that he was going<lb/>
to Prison full of Joy, being confident that all these things<lb/>
would turn to the furtherance of the Gospel, and the<lb/>
Glory of God.<lb/>
But he not being satisfied to go away and not leave some<lb/>
Exhortations with his People, he appointed them to meet<lb/>
him <choice ana="print-error">

And so with many <normalised orig="yernings" auto="false">yearnings</normalised> of his Bowels towards them,<lb/>
and theirs toward him, they took their <normalised orig="farewel" auto="true">farewell</normalised> of each other;<lb/>
a more affectionate Parting could not well be.<lb/>
About Nine a Clock, he with two or three Friends that<lb/>
were willing to accompany him, set out for <notvariant>Illchester</notvariant>: The<lb/>

him a foot some Miles out of the Town, with such<lb/>
Lamentations (that he told me after) did so affect him, that<lb/>
he could scarce bear them; but the Lord so strengthened<lb/>
him, that he passed through them all with great Courage,<lb/>
and Joy, labouring both by his <normalised orig="chearful" auto="true">cheerful</normalised> Countenance and<lb/>

He carried his <notvariant>Mittimus</notvariant> himself, and had no Officer with<lb/>
him; but when he came there, he found the <normalised orig="Goaler" auto="true">Jailer</normalised> absent,<lb/>
and took that <normalised orig="oportunity" auto="true">opportunity</normalised> to Preach before he went into the<lb/>
Prison; which was accounted by his Adversaries, a great<lb/>
addition to his former Crime. <normalised orig="Assoon" auto="true">As soon</normalised> as the <normalised orig="Goaler" auto="true">Jailer</normalised> came,<lb/>
he delivered his <notvariant>Mittimus</notvariant>, and was clapped up in the <normalised orig="Bridewel" auto="true">Bridewell</normalised><lb/>
Chamber, which was over the common Goal. When he came<lb/>
to the Prison, he found there Mr. John Norman, late Minister<lb/>
of <notvariant>Bridgwater</notvariant>, who for the like cause, was Apprehended<lb/>
and Committed a few days before him (a Man who for his<lb/>
singular Abilities in Preaching, his fervent Zeal and holy<lb/>
Boldness in the Cause of Christ, his Constancy to his Principles<lb/>
in the most Wavering and Shaking times, <normalised orig="joyned" auto="true">joined</normalised> with<lb/>
an exemplary Carriage and Conversation, was deservedly had<lb/>
in great Repute among the People of God in these Western<lb/>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
parts; and indeed there were very few that knew him, either<lb/>
among the sober Gentry, or <normalised orig="Commonalty" auto="false">commonality</normalised>, but for his eminent<lb/>
Parts, and spotless Life, had great respects for him.)<lb/>
There were also Five more Ministers, with Fifty Quakers,<lb/>
which had all their Lodgings in the same Room, only parted<lb/>
with a Mat, which they had done for a little more Retirement.<lb/>
It was not long after before Mr. Coven, and Mr. <notvariant>Powel</notvariant>,<lb/>
with Eight more, were brought into the same place, being<lb/>
taken at Meetings; which made their Rooms very straight,<lb/>
and it was so nigh to the upper part of the Prison, that they<lb/>
could touch the Tiles as they lay in their Beds; which made<lb/>
it very irksome, the Sun lying so hot on it all the day, and<lb/>
there being so many of them, and so much Resort continually<lb/>
of Friends, they had very little Air, till they were forced<lb/>
to take down the Glass, and some of the Tiles, to let in<lb/>
some Refreshment. But here they were confined to Lie and<lb/>
eat their Meals, and had no place but a small Garden, <normalised orig="joyned" auto="true">joined</normalised><lb/>
to the place where all the common Prisoners were, which<lb/>
was no Retirement for them, they having there and in their<lb/>
Chamber, the constant noise of those Wretches, except when<lb/>
they slept; who lay just under them, their Chains <normalised orig="ratling" auto="true">rattling</normalised>,<lb/>
their Tongues often blaspheming, or else Roaring and Singing<lb/>
by Night, as well as in the day: And if they went into<lb/>
the Courts of the Prison, there was the sight of their Clothes<lb/>
hanging full of Vermin, and themselves in their Rags and<lb/>
Chains: <choice ana="typeset-error">
                     <sic/>
                     <corr>But</corr>
                  </choice> that which was most grievous to them, they had<lb/>
no place to Retire to God in, neither alone, nor together.<lb/>
They were also much <normalised orig="mollested" auto="false">molested</normalised> by the Quakers, who would<lb/>
frequently disturb them by their Cavils, in the times of their<lb/>
Preaching, Praying, and Singing. and would come and work<lb/>
in their Callings just by them, while they were in <normalised orig="Dutys" auto="true">Duties</normalised>,<lb/>
which was no small disturbance to them: And the want of<lb/>
the Air was more to my Husband, than to most of them, because<lb/>
he always Accustomed himself both in Oxford, and after,<lb/>
to spend his most secret Hours abroad in by Places, in<lb/>
the Fields, or Woods.<lb/>
<normalised orig="Assoon" auto="true">As soon</normalised> as he came into the Prison, he Preached and Prayed,<lb/>
that he called the Consecration of it. After he had spent<lb/>
a day or two in the Prison, being willing to have me either<lb/>
in the Town, or there, to attend him, and to keep <choice ana="typeset-error">

                  <lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
with his Friends, who came frequently to Visit him, he<lb/>
then began to fit up his Lodging; having prevailed with the<lb/>
Keeper for one Corner which was more private than the rest,<lb/>
to set his Bed in, about which he made a little Partition by<lb/>
some Curtains, that so he might have some <normalised orig="Conveniency" auto="true">Convenience</normalised> for<lb/>
Retirement. This was much comfort to him, and after a few<lb/>
Weeks, he got leave of the Keeper to go out a Mornings and<lb/>
Evenings a Mile or more, which he did constantly, unless the<lb/>
Weather or his Keepers fury did hinder him.<lb/>
Their Diet was very good and sufficient, and sometimes<lb/>
abundant, by their Friends kindness. Here they <normalised orig="Preacht" auto="false">Preached</normalised><lb/>
once a day constantly, sometimes twice, and many came <normalised orig="dayly" auto="true">daily</normalised><lb/>
to hear them Eight or Ten Miles round about the<lb/>
Country, and Multitudes came to Visit them; it being a<lb/>
strange sight to see Ministers laid in such a place. Their Friends<lb/>
were exceeding kind to them, endeavouring by their frequent<lb/>
Visits, and provisions for Diet, and <normalised orig="supplys" auto="false">supplies</normalised> of Money,<lb/>
to make their Prison sweet to them.<lb/>
But my Husband's Labours were much increased by this,<lb/>
spending all the day in Converse, he was forced to take much<lb/>
of the Night for his Studies, and secret Converse with God.<lb/>
Thus he with my Brother Norman, and his Company, with<lb/>
their fellow Prisoners, continued in that place for four Months,<lb/>
being tossed from Sessions to Assizes. On the 14th. of July<lb/>
following, he was brought to the Sessions held at Taunton, and<lb/>
was there <normalised orig="Indited" auto="true">Indicted</normalised> for Preaching on May, the 17th. but the<lb/>
Evidence against him was so slender, that the Grand Jury<lb/>
could not find the Bill, so that he was not brought to his Answer<lb/>
there at all: And his Friends hoped he should have been<lb/>
Dismissed, it being the constant practice of the Court, that if a<lb/>
Prisoner be <normalised orig="Indited" auto="true">Indicted</normalised>, and no Bill found, he is Freed by Proclamation.<lb/>
But however, my Husband was sent to Prison<lb/>
again until the Assizes, and to his Friends that earnestly expected<lb/>
his <normalised orig="Inlargement" auto="true">Enlargement</normalised>, he said, Let us bless God that his<lb/>
Will is done, and not the will of such Worms as we.<lb/>
August, 24th. He was again <normalised orig="Indited" auto="true">Indicted</normalised> at the Assizes, and<lb/>
though the Evidence was the very same, that at the Sessions<lb/>
was by the Grand Jury, judged Insufficient, yet now at the<lb/>
Assizes, the Bill was by them found against him. So was he<lb/>
had to the Bar, and his <normalised orig="Inditement" auto="true">Indictment</normalised> read, which was to this<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="59">58</fw>

                  <lb/>
purpose: That he upon the 17th. day of May, 1663. with<lb/>
Twenty others to the Jurors unknown, did <notvariant>Riotously</notvariant>, <notvariant>Routously</notvariant>,<lb/>
and <notvariant>Seditiously</notvariant>, Assemble themselves together, contrary<lb/>
to the Peace of our <normalised orig="Soveraign" auto="true">Sovereign</normalised> Lord the King, and to<lb/>
the great <normalised orig="Terrour" auto="true">Terror</normalised> of his Subjects, and to the evil Example of<lb/>
others. Unto which, his Answer was, That as to Preaching,<lb/>
and Praying, which was the truth of the Case, of these things<lb/>
he was Guilty, and did own them as his Duty; but as for Riotous,<lb/>
<notvariant>Routous</notvariant>, and Seditious Assemblies, he did abhor them<lb/>
with his Heart, and of these he was not Guilty. At last he<lb/>
was found Guilty by the Petty Jury, and was Sentenced by<lb/>
the <choice ana="illegible">

                  </choice> should be made. Sentence being pronounced against<lb/>
him, he only made this brief Reply: That he was glad<lb/>
that it had appeared before his Country, that whatsoever he was<lb/>
Charged with, he was Guilty of nothing but doing his Duty, and<lb/>
that all did appear by the Evidence, was only that he had Sung a<lb/>
Psalm, and Instructed his Family, others being there, and both<lb/>
in his own <choice ana="illegible">

whatsoever Sentence his Lordship should pronounce upon him, for<lb/>
so Good and Righteous a Cause. Thus from the Assizes he was<lb/>
sent to Prison again, where he continued a whole Year wanting<lb/>
but Three days.<lb/>
But the Winter coming on, they were willing to try if they<lb/>

being like to be as Cold in the Winter, as it had been Hot in<lb/>
the Summer (there being no Chimney in the whole Chamber)<lb/>
which with some difficulty they obtained; and then had more<lb/>
comfortable Accommodations in all respects.<lb/>
Here they had very great Meetings, Week-days, and Sabbath-days,<lb/>
and many days of Humiliation, and Thanksgiving.<lb/>

Justices, and Judges, that they should be sent beyond Sea,<lb/>
or carried to some Island, where they should be kept close<lb/>
Prisoners; yet the Lord preserved them by his Power, and<lb/>
thus ordered it, that their Imprisonment was a great furtherance<lb/>
to the Gospel, and brought much Glory to him, both<lb/>
by their Preaching, and Conversing with Souls: In which<lb/>

Entitled A call to <notvariant>Archippus</notvariant>, to stir up his Non-conforming<lb/>
Brethren, to be diligent at their Work, whatsoever Dangers<lb/>
and Sufferings, they might meet withal: And because he<lb/>
could not go to his Flock, he had prepared for them, The Synopsis<lb/>
of the <choice ana="typeset-error">

                     <corr>Covenant</corr>
                  </choice>, which was after placed into one of<lb/>
my Fathers Books.<lb/>
And for the help of the <normalised orig="Governours" auto="true">Governors</normalised> of Families, in their<lb/>
Weekly Catechising those under their charge, he Explained<lb/>
all the Assemblies shorter Catechism, to which he Annexed an affectionate<lb/>
Letter, with Rules for their daily Examination;<lb/>
which were Printed and Dispersed into all their Houses by his<lb/>
Order, while he was a Prisoner. He also Writ many Holy,<lb/>
and Gracious, and Affectionate Letters to all his Relations,<lb/>
and many other Friends, to many Churches of Christ in other<lb/>
parts and places, both far and near.<lb/>
His Sufferings that he underwent for the sake of the Gospel,<lb/>
could neither remit his Zeal, nor abate his Activity for God,<lb/>
but he would gladly <normalised orig="imbrace" auto="true">embrace</normalised> all Opportunities of doing him<lb/>
Service. The Minister who was appointed to Preach at certain<lb/>
times to the Felons in the Prison: being by Sickness disabled<lb/>
for that Work, he freely performed that Office among<lb/>
them, as long as he was permitted; earnestly Exhorting them<lb/>
by Repentance towards God, and Faith toward our Lord Jesus<lb/>
Christ, to secure the Eternal welfare of their Souls; freely<lb/>
bestowing upon them according to his Ability for their Relief,<lb/>
that by doing good to their <normalised orig="Bodys" auto="true">Bodies</normalised>, he might win upon<lb/>
them to receive good for their Souls. He was very forward<lb/>
to promote the Education of Youth, in the Town of <notvariant>Juelchester</notvariant>,<lb/>
and Country adjacent, freely <choice ana="typeset-error">

on those that were of poor Families, to Instruct them in the<lb/>
Principles of Religion; stirring up the Elder to Teach, and<lb/>
<normalised orig="incouraging" auto="true">encouraging</normalised> the Younger to Learn. He was a serious and<lb/>
faithful Monitor to his fellow Sufferers, if he espied any thing<lb/>
in any of them that did not become the Gospel for which<lb/>
they Suffered.<lb/>
Here, as elsewhere, he was a careful redeemer of his time,<lb/>
his constant practice was early to begin the day with God,<lb/>
rising about Four of the Clock, and spending a considerable<lb/>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
part of the Morning in Meditation and Prayer, and then falling<lb/>
close to his Study in some Corner or other of the Prison,<lb/>
where he could be private. At times, he would spend near<lb/>
the whole Night in these Exercises, not putting off his Clothes<lb/>
at all, only taking the Repose of an Hour or two in his night<lb/>
Gown upon the Bed, and so up again. When any came to<lb/>
Visit him, he did not entertain them with needless Impertinent<lb/>
discourse, but that which was Serious, Profitable, and<lb/>
Edifying, in which he was careful to apply himself to them,<lb/>
according to their several Capacities, whether Elder, or<lb/>
Younger; Exhorting them to those gracious Practises which<lb/>

them from those Evils they might be most prone, and liable<lb/>

for the Work of Christ, and he would Labour to <normalised orig="Incourage" auto="true">Encourage</normalised><lb/>
the <normalised orig="Timerous" auto="true">Timorous</normalised> and Faint-hearted, by his own and others<lb/>
Experience, of the Mercy and Goodness of God in Prison,<lb/>
which was far beyond what they could have thought, or expected.<lb/>
He was a careful observer of that Rule of the Lord<lb/>
Jesus, Mat. 5.44. <quote type="biblical" ana="Mt 5.44">Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,<lb/>
do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that <notvariant>despitefully</notvariant><lb/>
use you, and persecute you.</quote> It was none of his practice to Exclaim<lb/>
against those that were the greatest Instruments of his<lb/>
Sufferings, but to pity their condition, requesting for them,<lb/>
as the Martyr Stephen did for those that stoned him, <quote type="biblical" ana="Acts 7.60">That God<lb/>

In all his Imprisonment, at present I could not <normalised orig="descern" auto="true">discern</normalised> his<lb/>

that he had laid the foundation for that Weakness, which<lb/>
suddenly after surprised him, and was his death.<lb/>
At his return from the Prison, he was far more earnest in his<lb/>

his people, who had no Minister that had the Oversight of<lb/>
them, though some came and <normalised orig="Preacht" auto="false">Preached</normalised> while he was absent;<lb/>

look with more care after their Salvation, now they were removed<lb/>
from them that longed for it, and had watched for<lb/>
their Souls; <choice ana="typeset-error">

miserable Creatures they were while Unregenerate, telling<lb/>
them how his Heart did yearn for them, and his Bowels turned<lb/>
within him for them; how he did pray and weep for them,<lb/>
when they were asleep, and how willingly he had suffered a<lb/>

But it pleased the All-wise God, to take him off from the<lb/>

was so disabled, that he was not able to perform the great and<lb/>

Injury to himself, because he would not wholly disappoint the<lb/>
