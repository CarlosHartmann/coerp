BErnard <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant> was borne at <notvariant>Kentmire</notvariant> in<lb/>
the County of <notvariant>Westmorland</notvariant> in the <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised><lb/>
of our Lord 1517. of an ancient and <normalised orig="honorable" auto="true">honourable</normalised><lb/>
family, being the son of Edwin <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant>,<lb/>
the elder brother of which Edwin was<lb/>
slain in the battle of <notvariant>Bosworth</notvariant>, being <normalised orig="heire" auto="true">heir</normalised><lb/>
in the fifth descent to Richard <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant>, who in the <normalised orig="Raign" auto="true">Reign</normalised> of<lb/>
King <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> was <notvariant>enfeoffed</notvariant> in the Lordship of <notvariant>Kentmire</notvariant> hall<lb/>
by the Baron of <notvariant>Kendall</notvariant> for his singular deserts both in<lb/>
peace and <normalised orig="warre" auto="true">war</normalised>. This was that Richard <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant> who slew<lb/>
the wilde <normalised orig="Boore" auto="true">Boor</normalised>, that <normalised orig="rageing" auto="true">raging</normalised> in the <normalised orig="mountaines" auto="true">mountains</normalised> <normalised orig="adioyning" auto="true">adjoining</normalised>,<lb/>
as sometimes did that of <notvariant>Erimanthus</notvariant>, had much <normalised orig="indammaged" auto="false">undamaged</normalised><lb/>
the Country-people: whence it is that the<lb/>
<notvariant>Gilpins</notvariant> in their <normalised orig="Coate" auto="true">Coat</normalised> <normalised orig="Armes" auto="true">Arms</normalised> <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> the <normalised orig="Boore" auto="true">Boor</normalised>. The Mother<lb/>
of Bernard <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant> was Margaret the Daughter of<lb/>
William <notvariant>Laton</notvariant> of <notvariant>Delamain</notvariant> in Cumberland, a man of an ancient<lb/>
house, and a family famous in that warlike age, as<lb/>
from whence had sprung many right valiant Gentlemen.<lb/>
This Bernard being yet a very <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> <normalised orig="gaue" auto="true">gave</normalised> testimony<lb/>
of future <normalised orig="holinesse" auto="true">holiness</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> this occasion. A <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> begging<lb/>
<normalised orig="Frier" auto="true">Friar</normalised> the better to dispose the hearts of the people<lb/>
to liberality towards him, professed <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> a Zealous<lb/>
Preacher: <notvariant>howbeit</notvariant> the <normalised orig="Friers" auto="true">Friars</normalised> of those <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised>, and that<lb/>
<normalised orig="ranke" auto="true">rank</normalised> were but a sordid and dishonest people, some of<lb/>
them, yea the greatest part labouring for a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> of <normalised orig="holinesse" auto="true">holiness</normalised>,<lb/>
but denying the power of it in their <normalised orig="liues" auto="true">lives</normalised> and conversations,<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
whereas others of them retained not so much<lb/>
as an outside thereof. This <normalised orig="wandring" auto="true">wandering</normalised> companion was<lb/>
come <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> the Saturday to the <choice ana="illegible">

                     <corr>house</corr>
                  </choice> of this <notvariant>Gilpins</notvariant> Father,<lb/>
as purposing to preach the next morrow being the<lb/>
Lords day; where he was <normalised orig="enterteined" auto="false">entertained</normalised> <choice ana="illegible">

                  </choice> enough:<lb/>
for at that time it was a <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised> <normalised orig="vnpardonable" auto="true">unpardonable</normalised> to<lb/>
offend the least of these locusts. The holy <normalised orig="Frier" auto="true">Friar</normalised> at supper<lb/>
time <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> like a glutton, and like a beast could not <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> over<lb/>
tossing the pot, <normalised orig="vntill" auto="true">until</normalised> being overcome with <normalised orig="drinke" auto="true">drink</normalised><lb/>
he exposed <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> a <normalised orig="shamefull" auto="true">shameful</normalised> spectacle to so <normalised orig="chast" auto="true">chaste</normalised> and<lb/>
sober a family. But in the morning as if he had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised><lb/>
some young Saint lately dropped from heaven, he <normalised orig="causeth" auto="true">causes</normalised><lb/>
the Bell to <normalised orig="towle" auto="true">towel</normalised> to the Sermon, and in the midst thereof<lb/>
blustering out <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> good words, he presumed to<lb/>
grow hot against some <normalised orig="sinnes" auto="true">sins</normalised> of the time, and amongst<lb/>
the rest to thunder <normalised orig="bouldly" auto="true">boldly</normalised> against <normalised orig="drunkennesse" auto="true">drunkenness</normalised>. Young<lb/>
<notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant> who had but newly got the <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> of his tongue, having<lb/>
observed (as it seemed) the <normalised orig="hatefull" auto="true">hateful</normalised> <normalised orig="basenesse" auto="true">baseness</normalised> of the<lb/>
man by his oversight the night before, and now hearing<lb/>
the beast cry out so loud against these crimes which <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised><lb/>
had so lately <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> guilty of, as he was sitting <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised><lb/>
to his Mothers lap in the Church <normalised orig="sodainly" auto="true">suddenly</normalised> <normalised orig="crieth" auto="true">cries</normalised> out in<lb/>
these words: O Mother, <normalised orig="doe" auto="false">do</normalised> you <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> how this fellow<lb/>
dare speak against <choice ana="typeset-error">

                  </choice>, who was <normalised orig="drunke" auto="true">drunk</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised><lb/>
<notvariant>yesternight</notvariant> at our house? The Mother made speed<lb/>
to stop the childes mouth with her hand, that he might<lb/>
<normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> no further. After this the parents of the boy perceiving<lb/>
his disposition by many evident testimonies<lb/>
were diligently <normalised orig="carefull" auto="true">careful</normalised> to make him a <normalised orig="scholler" auto="true">scholar</normalised>. He had a<lb/>
<notvariant>schoolfellow</notvariant> one Edwin Airy whom afterwards he loved<lb/>
<normalised orig="intirely" auto="true">entirely</normalised> for his good disposition and <normalised orig="approoved" auto="false">approved</normalised> honesty,<lb/>
but <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant> did <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> <normalised orig="excell" auto="true">excel</normalised> the rest in <normalised orig="acutenesse" auto="true">acuteness</normalised> of wit.<lb/>
Having therefore with great approbation passed his time<lb/>
in the <normalised orig="Grammar-schoole" auto="false">Grammar-school</normalised>, he is by his parents, (who had<lb/>
now conceived great hope of their <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised>) sent to Oxford.<lb/>
At that time in Oxford both learning and <normalised orig="Relligion" auto="false">Religion</normalised> were<lb/>
in all things out of <normalised orig="ioynt" auto="true">joint</normalised>, and over-grown with the rust of<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="Barbarisme" auto="true">Barbarism</normalised>. And now was young <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant> <normalised orig="sixteene" auto="true">sixteen</normalised> <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised><lb/>
of age at his <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> to Oxford, being in the <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> of<lb/>
our Lord 1533. Being <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> in <normalised orig="Queenes" auto="false">Queens</normalised> <normalised orig="Colledge" auto="true">College</normalised>, he<lb/>
profited wondrously in humane learning: He became, as<lb/>
almost all the good wits of that time very conversant in<lb/>
the writings of <notvariant>Erasmus</notvariant>. He fell very close to the study<lb/>
<normalised orig="Logick" auto="true">Logic</normalised> and Philosophy, wherein he was observed to<lb/>
grow excellent, and to <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised> away the bell in <normalised orig="schooles" auto="true">schools</normalised>.<lb/>
He added to this his humane learning, the singular knowledge<lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Greeke" auto="true">Greek</normalised> and Hebrew, wherein he made <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised><lb/>
of the assistance and friendship of one <normalised orig="Neale" auto="false">Neil</normalised>, betwixt<lb/>
whom and this <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant> was <normalised orig="growne" auto="true">grown</normalised> much familiarity by<lb/>
the <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>a*<notvariant>finity</notvariant></sic>
                     <corr>affinity</corr>
                  </choice> of their studies. This <normalised orig="Neale" auto="false">Neil</normalised> was a Fellow of<lb/>
<notvariant>New-Colledge</notvariant>, and afterwards <normalised orig="Professour" auto="true">Professor</normalised> of the Hebrew<lb/>
in Oxford. And now after some few <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> carefully spent<lb/>
in these studies <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant> began to be so famous, and so beloved<lb/>
in Oxford, that there was hardly any place of preferment<lb/>
for a <normalised orig="scholler" auto="true">scholar</normalised>, whereof the <notvariant>eminency</notvariant> of <notvariant>Gilpins</notvariant><lb/>
<normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> had not <normalised orig="rendred" auto="true">rendered</normalised> him worthy in the <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> estimation.<lb/>
There was then an enquiry made for men of<lb/>
more then ordinary learning and fame, who might make<lb/>
<normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> a number of <normalised orig="schollers" auto="true">scholars</normalised> in Christ-Church at that time<lb/>
newly begun, and honour it with the commendation of<lb/>
learning. Amongst these was our <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant> one of the first<lb/>
elected. At that time he had not fully attained to truth<lb/>
and sincerity in <normalised orig="Relligion" auto="false">Religion</normalised>, as having <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> <normalised orig="alwayes" auto="true">always</normalised> instructed<lb/>
in the traditions of the Church of Rome; for in<lb/>
those <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> the most part of men did not regulate their<lb/>
<normalised orig="Relligion" auto="false">Religion</normalised> and piety by the rule of Gods word, but according<lb/>
to the Traditions of their Fathers received from<lb/>
hand to hand. His <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> although disposed to <normalised orig="holinesse" auto="true">holiness</normalised><lb/>
did for a while <normalised orig="remaine" auto="true">remain</normalised> in <normalised orig="darknesse" auto="true">darkness</normalised>, and being <notvariant>overclouded</notvariant><lb/>
with <normalised orig="preiudiciall" auto="true">prejudicial</normalised> respects laboured <normalised orig="vnder" auto="true">under</normalised> the<lb/>
<normalised orig="burthen" auto="true">burden</normalised> of superstition not without some shadow of Antiquity;<lb/>
being more earnest against vices and corruptions<lb/>
of the time, then against the traditions of the Fathers.<lb/>
Therefore at that time <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant> seemed a great <normalised orig="vphoulder" auto="false">upholder</normalised><lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A2</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
of the Popish <normalised orig="Relligion" auto="false">Religion</normalised>. He held disputation <normalised orig="publickly" auto="true">publicly</normalised><lb/>
against <normalised orig="Iohn" auto="true">John</normalised> <notvariant>Hooper</notvariant>, who was afterwards Bishop of Worcester,<lb/>
and at the last a glorious Martyr of Christ. After<lb/>
the death of King Henry the eight, when Edward the <normalised orig="sixt" auto="true">sixth</normalised><lb/>
was King, Peter Martyr induced by the piety and Munificence<lb/>
of such a Prince read the Divinity Lecture in<lb/>
Oxford. Against whom the <notvariant>Sophisters</notvariant> <normalised orig="indeavoured" auto="true">endeavoured</normalised> to<lb/>
make opposition, <notvariant>Chedsey</notvariant>, <notvariant>Woston</notvariant>, and Morgan, who<lb/>
desired also to draw in <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant> on their side, that by his<lb/>
advise and help they might the more distract Peter <normalised orig="Martir" auto="true">Martyr</normalised>:<lb/>
and the matter at last came to this push, that <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant><lb/>
was produced to <normalised orig="hould" auto="true">hold</normalised> disputation against the positions<lb/>
of Peter <normalised orig="Martir" auto="true">Martyr</normalised>. <normalised orig="Vpon" auto="true">Upon</normalised> occasion of which dispute <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant><lb/>
to the end that he might defend his cause in hand <normalised orig="adventureth" auto="false">adventures</normalised><lb/>
more diligently then ordinary to examine the<lb/>
Scriptures and the <normalised orig="auncient" auto="true">ancient</normalised> Fathers: And by how much<lb/>
the more he studied to defend the cause which he had <normalised orig="vndertaken" auto="true">undertaken</normalised>,<lb/>
so much the <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised> confidence he began to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised><lb/>
therein, because he supposed that he ought to stand for<lb/>
the truth, which he <normalised orig="stroue" auto="true">strove</normalised> with all his might to discover<lb/>
and <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> out. But whiles he was zealously searching for<lb/>
the truth, he began by little and little to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> a sight of his<lb/>
<normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="errours" auto="true">errors</normalised>. Whereupon Peter <normalised orig="Martir" auto="true">Martyr</normalised> was wont often<lb/>
to say, that he was not much troubled either for Weston,<lb/>
Morgan, or the like, but as for that <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant>, (saith he) I<lb/>
am very much <normalised orig="mooved" auto="true">moved</normalised> concerning him, for he <normalised orig="doth" auto="false">does</normalised> and<lb/>
<normalised orig="speaketh" auto="true">speaks</normalised> all things with an <normalised orig="vpright" auto="true">upright</normalised> heart. The rest <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised><lb/>
to me to be men, who regard their bellies most of all, and<lb/>
being most <normalised orig="vnconstant" auto="true">inconstant</normalised> are carried away as it were with<lb/>
every blast of ambition and <normalised orig="covetousnesse" auto="true">covetousness</normalised>. But <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant> resting<lb/>
<normalised orig="firmely" auto="true">firmly</normalised> <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> gravity of manners, and the testimony<lb/>
of a most laudable life <normalised orig="seemeth" auto="true">seems</normalised> to honour with his<lb/>
<normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="goodnesse" auto="true">goodness</normalised> the cause which he <normalised orig="vndertaketh" auto="true">undertakes</normalised>. Yea,<lb/>
and he did often pray <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> God that he would be pleased<lb/>
at the last to convert <normalised orig="vnto" auto="true">unto</normalised> his truth the heart of <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant>,<lb/>
being so <notvariant>inclinable</notvariant> to all honest desires. And <normalised orig="doubtlesse" auto="true">doubtless</normalised><lb/>
God heard the prayer of Peter <normalised orig="Martir" auto="true">Martyr</normalised>: For from that<lb/>

                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
time forward <notvariant>Gilpin</notvariant> drew <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> to the knowledge of the<lb/>
truth, not <normalised orig="vpon" auto="true">upon</normalised> a <normalised orig="sodaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised>, but as <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> confessed by degrees.<lb/>
