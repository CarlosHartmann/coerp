DOctor Henry Hammond,<lb/>
whose Life is now attempted<lb/>
to be written,<lb/>
was born upon<lb/>
the 18 of August in the year 1605.<lb/>
at <notvariant>Chersey</notvariant> in Surrey, a place formerly<lb/>
of remark for J. <notvariant>Cæsar's</notvariant> supposed<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="2">A2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
passing his Army there over<lb/>
the Thames, in his Enterprise<lb/>
upon this Island, as also for the<lb/>
entertainment of Devotion in its<lb/>
earliest reception by our Saxon<lb/>
Ancestors; and of later years,<lb/>
for the Charity of having given<lb/>
burial to the equally pious and<lb/>
unfortunate Prince King Hen. VI.<lb/>
He was the youngest Son of<lb/>
D<hi rend="high">R</hi> John Hammond Physician to<lb/>
Prince Henry, and from that great<lb/>
<notvariant>favourer</notvariant> of meriting servants and<lb/>
their relations, had the <normalised orig="honor" auto="true">honour</normalised> at<lb/>
the Font to receive his Christian<lb/>
Name.<lb/>
Being yet in his long Coats,<lb/>
(which heretofore were usually<lb/>
worn beyond the years of Infancy;)<lb/>
he was sent to Eaton<lb/>
School; where his pregnancy having<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
been <normalised orig="advantag'd" auto="true">advantaged</normalised> by the<lb/>
more then paternal care and industry<lb/>
of his Father (who was<lb/>
an exact <normalised orig="Critick" auto="true">Critic</normalised> in the learned<lb/>
Languages, especially the Greek,<lb/>
whereof he had been <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised><lb/>
Professor in the University of<lb/>
Cambridge) became the observation<lb/>
of those that knew him: for<lb/>
in that tenderness of age he was<lb/>
not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> a Proficient in Greek<lb/>
and <normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised>, but had also some<lb/>
knowledge in the Elements of<lb/>
Hebrew: in the later of which<lb/>
Tongues, it being then rarely<lb/>
heard of even out of Grammar<lb/>
Schools, he grew the Tutor of<lb/>
those who begun to write themselves<lb/>
men, but thought it no<lb/>
shame to learn of one whose<lb/>
knowledge <normalised orig="seem'd" auto="true">seemed</normalised> rather <normalised orig="infus'd" auto="true">infused</normalised><lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="4">A3</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
then <normalised orig="acquir'd" auto="true">acquired</normalised>; or in whom<lb/>
the learned Languages might<lb/>
be thought to be the Mother-Tongue.<lb/>
His skill in Greek<lb/>
was particularly <normalised orig="advantag'd" auto="true">advantaged</normalised> by<lb/>
the conversation and kindness<lb/>
of M<hi rend="high">R</hi> Allen, one of the Fellows of<lb/>
the College, excellently seen in<lb/>
that Language, and a great assistant<lb/>
of S<hi rend="high">R</hi> Henry <notvariant>Savile</notvariant> in his<lb/>
magnificent edition of S<hi rend="high">t</hi> <notvariant>Chrysostome</notvariant>.<lb/>
His sweetness of Carriage is<lb/>
very particularly <normalised orig="remembred" auto="true">remembered</normalised> by<lb/>
his contemporaries, who <normalised orig="observ'd" auto="true">observed</normalised><lb/>
that he was never <normalised orig="engag'd" auto="true">engaged</normalised> (upon<lb/>
any occasion) into fights or quarrels;<lb/>
as also that at times allowed<lb/>
for Play, he would steal from his<lb/>
fellows into places of privacy,<lb/>
there to say his prayers: Omens of<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
his future <normalised orig="pacifick" auto="true">pacific</normalised> temper and<lb/>
eminent Devotion.<lb/>
At Thirteen years old he was<lb/>
thought, and (what is much more<lb/>
rare) was indeed ripe for the University,<lb/>
and accordingly sent to<lb/>
<notvariant>Magdalen</notvariant> College in Oxford,<lb/>
where not long after he was<lb/>
chosen <normalised orig="Demie" auto="true">Demi</normalised>; and though he<lb/>
stood low upon the <normalised orig="rolle" auto="true">roll</normalised>, by a<lb/>
very unusual concurrence of providential<lb/>
Events, <normalised orig="happen'd" auto="true">happened</normalised> to<lb/>
be sped: and though having<lb/>
then lost his Father, he became<lb/>
destitute of the advantage which<lb/>
potent recommendation might<lb/>
have given, yet his merit voting<lb/>
for him, as soon as capable, he<lb/>
was chosen Fellow.<lb/>
Being to proceed M<hi rend="high">R</hi> of Arts,<lb/>
he was made Reader of the natural<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="6">A4</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
Philosophy Lecture in the<lb/>
College, and also was employed<lb/>
in making the Funeral Oration<lb/>
on the highly-meriting President<lb/>
D<hi rend="high">R</hi> <notvariant>Langton</notvariant>.<lb/>
Having taken his Degree, he<lb/>
presently bought a <normalised orig="Systeme" auto="false">System</normalised> of<lb/>
Divinity, with design to apply<lb/>
himself <normalised orig="straightway" auto="false">straightaway</normalised> to that study:<lb/>
but upon second thoughts he <normalised orig="return'd" auto="true">returned</normalised><lb/>
for a time to Humane<lb/>
Learning, and afterwards, when<lb/>
he <normalised orig="resum'd" auto="true">resumed</normalised> his purpose for Theology,<lb/>
took a quite different<lb/>
Course of reading from the other<lb/>
too much usual, beginning that<lb/>
Science at the upper end, as conceiving<lb/>
it most reasonable to<lb/>
search for primitive Truth in the<lb/>
primitive Writers, and not to suffer<lb/>
his Understanding to be <normalised orig="prepossest" auto="true">prepossessed</normalised><lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
by the contrived and <normalised orig="interessed" auto="false">interested</normalised><lb/>
Schemes of modern, and<lb/>
<normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised> obnoxious, Authors.<lb/>
<notvariant>Anno</notvariant> 1629. being twenty<lb/>
four years of age, the Statutes of<lb/>
his House directing, and the Canons<lb/>
of the Church then regularly<lb/>
permitting it, he <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> into<lb/>
Holy Orders, and upon the same<lb/>
grounds not long after took the<lb/>
degree of Bachelor in Divinity,<lb/>
giving as happy proof of his proficiency<lb/>
in Sacred, as before he<lb/>
had done in Secular knowledge.<lb/>
During the whole time of his<lb/>
abode in the University he generally<lb/>
spent 13 hours of the day<lb/>
in Study; by which assiduity,<lb/>
besides an exact dispatch of the<lb/>
whole Course of Philosophy, he<lb/>
read over in a manner all <normalised orig="Classick" auto="true">Classic</normalised><lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="8">7</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
Authors that are extant;<lb/>
and upon the more considerable<lb/>
wrote, as he passed, <notvariant>Scholia</notvariant> and<lb/>
critical emendations, and drew<lb/>
up Indexes for his private use at<lb/>
the beginning and end of each<lb/>
book: all which remain at this<lb/>
time, and testify his indefatigable<lb/>
pains to as many as have <normalised orig="perus'd" auto="true">perused</normalised><lb/>
his Library.<lb/>
In the year 1633. the Reverend<lb/>
D<hi rend="high">R</hi> <notvariant>Frewen</notvariant>, the then President<lb/>
of his College, now Lord Archbishop<lb/>
of York, gave him the<lb/>
<normalised orig="honor" auto="true">honour</normalised> to supply one of his courses<lb/>
at the Court; where the right<lb/>
<normalised orig="Honorable" auto="true">Honourable</normalised> the Earl of Leicester<lb/>
happening to be an Auditor, he<lb/>
was so deeply affected with the<lb/>
Sermon, and took so just a measure<lb/>
of the merit of the Preacher<lb/>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
thence, that the Rectory of <notvariant>Pensehurst</notvariant><lb/>
being at that time void, and<lb/>
in his gift, he immediately <normalised orig="offer'd" auto="true">offered</normalised><lb/>
him the presentation: which<lb/>
being accepted, he was inducted<lb/>
on the 22 of August in the same<lb/>
year; and thenceforth from the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Scholastick" auto="true">Scholastic</normalised> retirements of an<lb/>
University life, applied himself<lb/>
to the more busy Entertainments<lb/>
of a rural privacy, and what<lb/>
some have <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> the being buried<lb/>
in a Living: and being to leave<lb/>
the House, he thought not fit<lb/>
to take that advantage of his<lb/>
place, which from Sacrilege or<lb/>
selling of the Founders Charity,<lb/>
was by <normalised orig="custome" auto="true">custom</normalised> grown to be prudence<lb/>
and good husbandry.<lb/>
In the discharge of his Ministerial<lb/>
function, he satisfied not<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="10">9</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
himself in diligent and constant<lb/>
Preaching only; (a performance<lb/>
wherein some of late have <normalised orig="phansied" auto="false">fancied</normalised><lb/>
all Religion to consist) but<lb/>
much more conceived himself<lb/>
obliged to the offering up the<lb/>
solemn daily Sacrifice of Prayer<lb/>
for his people, <normalised orig="administring" auto="true">administering</normalised> the<lb/>
Sacraments, relieving the poor,<lb/>
keeping Hospitality, reconciling<lb/>
of differences amongst Neighbours,<lb/>
Visiting the sick, Catechising<lb/>
the youth.<lb/>
As to the first of these, his<lb/>
Preaching, <normalised orig="'twas" auto="true">it was</normalised> not at the ordinary<lb/>
rate of the Times, an unpremeditated,<lb/>
<notvariant>undigested</notvariant> effusion<lb/>
of shallow and crude conceptions;<lb/>
but a rational and just<lb/>
discourse, that was to teach the<lb/>
Priest as well as the Lay-hearer.<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="11">10</fw>
                  <pb n="10"/>
                  <lb/>
His Method was (which likewise<lb/>
he recommended to his<lb/>
friends) after every Sermon to resolve<lb/>
upon the ensuing Subject;<lb/>
that being done, to pursue the<lb/>
course of study which he was<lb/>
then in hand with, reserving the<lb/>
Close of the Week for the provision<lb/>
for the next Lords-day.<lb/>
Whereby not only a constant<lb/>
progress was made in Science,<lb/>
but materials unawares were<lb/>
<normalised orig="gain'd" auto="true">gained</normalised> unto the immediate future<lb/>
Work: for, he said, be the<lb/>
Subjects treated of never so distant,<lb/>
somewhat will infallibly<lb/>
fall in <notvariant>conducible</notvariant> unto the present<lb/>
purpose.<lb/>
The offices of Prayer he had in<lb/>
his Church, not only upon the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Sundayes" auto="true">Sundays</normalised> and Festivals and their<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="12">11</fw>

Eves, as also <normalised orig="Wednesdayes" auto="false">Wednesdays</normalised> and<lb/>
<normalised orig="Fridayes" auto="false">Fridays</normalised>, according to the appointment<lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Rubrick" auto="false">Rubric</normalised>; (which<lb/>
strict duty and ministration<lb/>
when <normalised orig="'tis" auto="true">it is</normalised> examined to the <normalised orig="bottome" auto="true">bottom</normalised><lb/>
will prove the greatest objection<lb/>
against the Liturgy; as<lb/>
that which, besides its own trouble<lb/>
and austerity, leaves no leisure<lb/>
for <notvariant>factious</notvariant> and licentious<lb/>
meetings at Fairs and Markets)<lb/>
but every day in the week, and<lb/>
twice on <normalised orig="Saturdayes" auto="true">Saturdays</normalised> and <normalised orig="Holyday" auto="true">Holiday</normalised><lb/>
Eves: For his assistance<lb/>
wherein he kept a Curate, and<lb/>
<normalised orig="allow'd" auto="false">allowed</normalised> him a comfortable Salary.<lb/>
And at those Devotions he<lb/>
took order that his Family should<lb/>
give diligent and exemplary attendance:<lb/>
which was the <normalised orig="easilier" auto="false">easier</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="perform'd" auto="true">performed</normalised>, it being guided by<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="13">12</fw>

                  <lb/>
his Mother, a woman of ancient<lb/>
<normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised>, and one to whom he paid<lb/>
a more then filial Obedience.<lb/>
As to the Administration of the<lb/>
Sacrament, he reduced it to an<lb/>
imitation, though a distant one, of<lb/>
Primitive frequency, to once a<lb/>
<normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised>, and therewith its <notvariant>anciently</notvariant><lb/>
inseparable <notvariant>Appendant</notvariant>,<lb/>
the Offertory: wherein his instruction<lb/>
and happily-insinuating<lb/>
Example so <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> <normalised orig="prevail'd" auto="true">prevailed</normalised>, that<lb/>
there was thenceforth little need<lb/>
of ever making any <normalised orig="taxe" auto="true">tax</normalised> for the<lb/>
poor. Nay, (if the report of a<lb/>
sober person, born and bred up in<lb/>
that Parish, be to be <normalised orig="believ'd" auto="true">believed</normalised>) in<lb/>
short time a stock was <normalised orig="rais'd" auto="true">raised</normalised> to<lb/>
be <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> ready for the <normalised orig="apprentising" auto="false">apprenticing</normalised><lb/>
of young Children, whose<lb/>
Parents condition made the provision<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="14">13</fw>
                  <pb n="13"/>
                  <lb/>
for them an equal Charity<lb/>
to both the Child and Parent. And<lb/>
after this there yet <normalised orig="remain'd" auto="true">remained</normalised> a<lb/>
<notvariant>Superplusage</notvariant> for the assistance of<lb/>
the neighbour Parishes.<lb/>
For the Relief of the Poor, besides<lb/>
the <normalised orig="foremention'd" auto="true">forementioned</normalised> Expedient,<lb/>
wherein others were <notvariant>sharers</notvariant><lb/>
with him, unto his private<lb/>
Charity, the dedicating the tenth<lb/>
of all <normalised orig="receits" auto="true">receipts</normalised>, and the daily Alms<lb/>
given at the door; he constantly<lb/>
set apart over and above every<lb/>
week a certain rate in money:<lb/>
and however rarely his own <normalised orig="rent-dayes" auto="false">rent-days</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="occurr'd" auto="true">occurred</normalised>, the indigent had<lb/>
two and fifty <normalised orig="quarter-dayes" auto="false">quarter-days</normalised> returning<lb/>
in his year. Yet farther, another<lb/>
Art of Charity he had, the<lb/>
selling Corn to his poor Neighbours<lb/>
at a rate below the Market-price:<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="15">14</fw>
                  <pb n="14"/>
                  <lb/>
which though, as he said,<lb/>
he had reason to do, gaining thereby<lb/>
the charge of portage; was a<lb/>
great benefit to them, who besides<lb/>
the abatement of price, and<lb/>
possibly forbearance, saved thereby<lb/>
a <normalised orig="dayes-work" auto="false">day's work</normalised>.<lb/>
He that was thus <normalised orig="liberall" auto="true">liberal</normalised> to<lb/>
the <notvariant>necessitous</notvariant> poor, was no<lb/>
less hospitable to those of better<lb/>
quality: and as at other times he<lb/>
frequently invited his Neighbours<lb/>
to his table, so more especially<lb/>
on <normalised orig="Sundayes" auto="true">Sundays</normalised>; which <normalised orig="seldome" auto="true">seldom</normalised><lb/>
past at any time without bringing<lb/>
some of them his guests: but<lb/>
here beyond the Weekly treatments,<lb/>
the Christmas Festival had<lb/>
a peculiar allowance to support<lb/>
it. He knew well how much the<lb/>
application at the Table <normalised orig="inforc'd" auto="true">enforced</normalised><lb/>
                  <lb/>

                  <lb/>
the doctrines of the Pulpit, and<lb/>
how subservient the endearing of<lb/>
his person was to the recommending<lb/>
his instructions, how far<lb/>
upon these motives our Saviour<lb/>
thought fit to eat with publicans<lb/>
and sinners, and how effectual<lb/>
the loaves were to the procuring<lb/>
of Disciples.<lb/>
As by <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> admonition he<lb/>
most diligently <normalised orig="instill'd" auto="true">instilled</normalised> that great<lb/>
fundamental doctrine of Peace<lb/>
and Love, so did he likewise in<lb/>
his private address and conversation,<lb/>
being never at peace in himself,<lb/>
till he had <normalised orig="procur'd" auto="true">procured</normalised> it amongst<lb/>
his Neighbours; wherein God<lb/>
so <normalised orig="blest" auto="true">blessed</normalised> him, that he not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised><lb/>
<normalised orig="attain'd" auto="true">attained</normalised> his purpose of uniting<lb/>

but, contrary to the usual fate of<lb/>

tender and very filial affection, in<lb/>

one of his Neighbours<lb/>

he never had any vexatious law<lb/>

his Tithes fully paid, and not of<lb/>

the very best.<lb/>

of, that after his remove<lb/>

and hearing of the Sickness of<lb/>
