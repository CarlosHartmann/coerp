I. TOuching her Earthly Parentage. This M<hi rend="high"><notvariant>ris</notvariant></hi><lb/>
Sarah Wight, was daughter to M<hi rend="high">r</hi>. Thomas<lb/>
Wight, sometimes of the Auditors Office, and of the<lb/>
Exchequers Office: Her earthly dwelling is now with<lb/>
her <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> Mother M<hi rend="high"><notvariant>ris</notvariant></hi> Mary Wight, widow, in<lb/>
Lawrence <notvariant>Pountney-Lane</notvariant>, by Caning-street in LONDON:<lb/>
Whose Father was M<hi rend="high">r</hi> Edward <notvariant>Purcel</notvariant> Esquire,<lb/>
of <notvariant>Ansloo</notvariant> <normalised orig="neer" auto="true">near</normalised> <notvariant>Shrewbury</notvariant>: and whose former Husband<lb/>
was M<hi rend="high">r</hi>. Edward Vaughan Esquire, the Kings<lb/>
Receiver, and <notvariant>Surveyer</notvariant> for Northampton-shire, and<lb/>
for <notvariant>Rutland-shire</notvariant>: by whom <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had her <normalised orig="sonne" auto="true">son</normalised><lb/>
M<hi rend="high">r</hi>. Jonathan Vaughan, now of <normalised orig="Alsoules" auto="false">All-souls</normalised> in Oxford.<lb/>
Who not long since writ thence a <normalised orig="Consolatory" auto="false">Conciliatory</normalised><lb/>
Letter to this his <normalised orig="sorrowfull" auto="true">sorrowful</normalised> Sister SARAH,<lb/>
therein saying thus: Doest thou <normalised orig="despaire" auto="true">despair</normalised>, because<lb/>
thy Tempter is a <normalised orig="Lyon" auto="false">Lion</normalised> for his strength? Behold the<lb/>
<normalised orig="Lyon" auto="false">Lion</normalised> of the Tribe of <notvariant>Judah</notvariant>, Christ the mighty<lb/>
God: who can and will deliver thee out of his paw.<lb/>
A fountain laid open for <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>, and for <normalised orig="uncleannesse" auto="true">uncleanness</normalised>.<lb/>
I verily <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised>, that although for the present<lb/>
you lie among the pots, of no use: yet thy God will<lb/>
make thee a <normalised orig="Vessell" auto="true">Vessel</normalised> of Honour, an instrument fit for<lb/>
thy Masters use; whereby he will square sinners, to<lb/>
his own glory, &amp;c.] This in his Letter is now fulfilled,<lb/>
and fulfilling. <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> that was born of flesh<lb/>
and <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>, borne in <normalised orig="sinne" auto="true">sin</normalised>; and that was by Nature<lb/>
a <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> of wrath: is now borne from above,<lb/>
borne of God, having given to her Faith<lb/>
and Love: and <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> Jesus Christ<lb/>
to her Brother, and God to her<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="6">B3</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
Father, and her dwelling place: He<lb/>
dwelling in her, and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> in him: Let<lb/>
him and her that <normalised orig="glorieth" auto="true">glories</normalised>, not glory<lb/>
in the flesh, but in the Lord alone.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
II. Touching her Education: In the time of her<lb/>
Mothers deep afflictions of Spirit, and sore Temptations,<lb/>
<normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was well trained up in the Scriptures,<lb/>
by her godly <normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> Grand-mother, M<hi rend="high"><notvariant>ris</notvariant></hi> Wight<lb/>
of <notvariant>Daintree</notvariant>. And when the Lords time of Love<lb/>
was, that he vouchsafed to manifest his Grace<lb/>
in Christ to her Mothers <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised>, then the Lord<lb/>
brought her home to her, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> being then about 9<lb/>
<normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> old. <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> gave her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> much to read and<lb/>
study the Scriptures: Which though <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> then understood<lb/>
not aright; yet the Lord by his Holy<lb/>
Spirit brought to her remembrance, and opened to<lb/>
her since her restoring, what formerly <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had<lb/>
read; for great comfort and soul-refreshing to her<lb/>
<normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, and to many others; as hereafter <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>.<lb/>
Which is a great encouragement to all that <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised><lb/>
God, to train up their children in the holy Scriptures;<lb/>
as, 2 Tim. 3. 15. Chap. 1. 5. <notvariant>Prov</notvariant>. 22. 6. <normalised orig="Deut" auto="true">Deuteronomy</normalised>.<lb/>
6. 6, 7. Gen. 18. 19.<lb/>
III. Touching her afflictions. From her childhood<lb/>
she was of a tender heart, and oft afflicted in<lb/>
Spirit: Her Temptations were not so great, till<lb/>
<normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was about twelve <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised> old; since which, they<lb/>
have continued with more violence till <normalised orig="Aprill" auto="true">April</normalised> 6.<lb/>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
1647. it being about 4. <normalised orig="yeares" auto="true">years</normalised>. [Shee is not sixteen<lb/>
<normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> old (as her Mother saith,) till September<lb/>
following.]<lb/>
The beginning of her more violent Temptations<lb/>
was thus: Her <normalised orig="superiour" auto="true">superior</normalised> bid her <normalised orig="doe" auto="false">do</normalised> a small<lb/>
thing, judging it meet and <normalised orig="lawfull" auto="true">lawful</normalised>: <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> did it,<lb/>
<notvariant>doubtingly</notvariant>, fearing it was <normalised orig="unlawfull" auto="true">unlawful</normalised>: and as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised><lb/>
did it, a great Trembling in her hands and body<lb/>
fell upon her: being condemned in her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>. About<lb/>
a <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised> after, returning home, having been abroad,<lb/>
<normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had lost her hood, and knew <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had<lb/>
lost it. Her Mother asked her, for her hood. <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised><lb/>
suddenly answered, My Grand-mother <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> it.<lb/>
Her heart condemned her instantly, and trembled<lb/>
<normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> exceedingly. And these were the first <normalised orig="chiefe" auto="true">chief</normalised><lb/>
occasions of her deep <normalised orig="despaire" auto="true">despair</normalised>: And upon this,<lb/>
<normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had cast into her Conscience, that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was<lb/>
both a <normalised orig="Thiefe" auto="true">Thief</normalised>, and a <normalised orig="lyar" auto="true">liar</normalised>, and was terrified ever since,<lb/>
that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was shut out of Heaven, and must be<lb/>
<normalised orig="damn'd" auto="true">damned</normalised>, <normalised orig="damn'd" auto="true">damned</normalised>.<lb/>
In the last four <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was oft in such extremities,<lb/>
<normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> nothing but Hell and<lb/>
Wrath - to be her Portion; and other times, that<lb/>
there was no heaven, nor hell, but in our Conscience:<lb/>
and that <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was <normalised orig="damn'd" auto="true">damned</normalised> already, being an <normalised orig="unbeleever" auto="false">unbeliever</normalised>:<lb/>
and therefore if <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could but dispatch<lb/>
this life of hers, there was an end of her sorrows.<lb/>
A subtle deceit of the old Serpent! Hence <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> oft<lb/>
attempted wickedly to destroy her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, as by<lb/>
drowning, strangling, stabbing, seeking to beat<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="8">B4</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
out her <normalised orig="braines" auto="true">brains</normalised>, wretchedly bruising, and wounding<lb/>
her self. The <normalised orig="chiefe" auto="true">chief</normalised> cause of such <normalised orig="weaknes" auto="true">weakness</normalised> since<lb/>
But the Lord who is her life, and loved her<lb/>
then in her <normalised orig="bloud" auto="true">blood</normalised>, he wonderfully prevented her<lb/>
destruction, many <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised>. Sometimes by one or<lb/>
other at that instant, sometimes staying her in the<lb/>
acting, when no creature was by: Sometimes by<lb/>
bringing to her <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> some choice Scripture: as<lb/>
this, <quote type="biblical" ana="Isa 54.17">No weapon <normalised orig="form'd" auto="true">formed</normalised> against thee, shall prosper</quote>, (<notvariant>Isa</notvariant>.<lb/>
54.17.) or this, <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 10.28">None shall take them out of my hand</quote>;<lb/>
or, <quote type="biblical" ana="Jn 10.29">out of my Fathers hand</quote> (<notvariant>Joh</notvariant>. 10.28, 29) This<lb/>
<normalised orig="stop'd" auto="true">stopped</normalised> her <normalised orig="sinfull" auto="true">sinful</normalised> act, but the comfort stayed not.<lb/>
Many precious Ministers came to comfort her:<lb/>
In London these, M<hi rend="high">r</hi> Thomas Goodwin, M<hi rend="high">r</hi> Barker,<lb/>
M<hi rend="high">r</hi> <notvariant>Lockyar</notvariant>, M<hi rend="high">r</hi> Palmer their Minister in Lawrence<lb/>
<notvariant>Pountney</notvariant>, M<hi rend="high">r</hi> <normalised orig="Sprigge" auto="true">Sprig</normalised>, M<hi rend="high">r</hi> John Simpson, and others.<lb/>
And these came to her in or <normalised orig="neer" auto="true">near</normalised> Shrewsbury,<lb/>
M<hi rend="high">r</hi> <notvariant>Hildershame</notvariant> of <notvariant>Felton</notvariant>, M<hi rend="high">r</hi> <notvariant>Paget</notvariant> (Father of D<hi rend="high">r</hi>

M<hi rend="high">r</hi> Smith, M<hi rend="high">r</hi> Fisher, M<hi rend="high">r</hi> Blake, M<hi rend="high">r</hi> Morgan Floyd,<lb/>
M<hi rend="high">r</hi> <notvariant>Moston</notvariant>: All these and many <normalised orig="moe" auto="true">more</normalised> godly Ministers<lb/>
and precious Christians, being acquainted<lb/>
with her sad <choice ana="illegible">

                     <corr>condition</corr>
                  </choice>, endeavoured to comfort<lb/>
her: and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> gladly would have received comfort;<lb/>
but it was then hid from her.<lb/>
Some glimpse <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had, especially by <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> of<lb/>
her kinsman, M<hi rend="high">r</hi> John Browne, of Shrewsbury (a<lb/>
<normalised orig="faithfull" auto="true">faithful</normalised> and loving man) and by one whom he<lb/>
brought with him, viz. M<hi rend="high">r</hi> Daniel Floyd: but it was<lb/>
soon <normalised orig="ecclipsed" auto="true">eclipsed</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>; and <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> remained in grievous<lb/>

                  <lb/>
<normalised orig="horrour" auto="true">horror</normalised> day and night; concluding <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was<lb/>
a Cast-away, a Reprobate, walking daily in the<lb/>
midst of fire and brimstone, as one in Hell already.<lb/>
Till the Lord (who had loved her with an<lb/>
everlasting love, and in loving <normalised orig="kindnesse" auto="true">kindness</normalised> prevented<lb/>
her <normalised orig="ruine" auto="true">ruin</normalised>,) at last restored comforts to her, and to<lb/>
those that had prayed and mourned for her.<lb/>
And since her much <notvariant>prayed-</notvariant> and hoped-for-deliverance,<lb/>

were these Ministers; M<hi rend="high">r</hi> Palmer, M<hi rend="high">r</hi> <normalised orig="Sprigge" auto="true">Sprig</normalised>, and<lb/>

About a <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised> before her great deliverance, Satan<lb/>

<normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> could not rest at all, for many <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> and<lb/>

answered, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> would not for all the world, but <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had<lb/>

One day being strongly carried on in that temptation,<lb/>
that there was no other Hell, but here in the<lb/>

<normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> threw the cup with violence, against the far<lb/>

said, <normalised orig="Loe" auto="true">Lo</normalised> here child, it is not broke. <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> got it <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>,<lb/>

struggled, and did <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> or five times, and yet it<lb/>

did it. I could not love him, till he made known his<lb/>
love to me: to me, the chiefest of sinners. If all the sins<lb/>
in all the world, were in one party, I thought it was all<lb/>
nothing to mine. I could not <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> any in all the Scriptures<lb/>

<normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> <normalised orig="shew'd" auto="true">showed</normalised> mercy to me, the chiefest of sinners. O, that<lb/>
he should come from the <normalised orig="bosome" auto="true">bosom</normalised> of the Father, to <normalised orig="dye" auto="false">die</normalised> for<lb/>

me; that my sins were <normalised orig="pardon'd" auto="true">pardoned</normalised>, I could not have <normalised orig="beleev'd" auto="true">believed</normalised><lb/>
them. But now, if all the men in the world, and<lb/>
Angels and Devils, should tell me they are not forgiven,<lb/>
I would not <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> them.<lb/>
What <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> did I take in going to men, to have<lb/>

But Christ did it in a moment. They that know his<lb/>
Name, will trust in him: they cannot but trust in him.<lb/>
If the world knew him, they could not but love him.<lb/>
He is the chiefest of ten thousands. He is more to be desired<lb/>
in his lowest estate, then millions of worlds, if<lb/>
millions of worlds were all in one.<lb/>

her to forbear speaking too much; because it spent<lb/>
her, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> being so very weak. <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised> said; In rest and<lb/>

looking on it, and smelling its <normalised orig="sweetnes" auto="true">sweetness</normalised>, commended<lb/>

April 25. being the Lords day, when many Christians<lb/>

In like humble manner, her face being covered,<lb/>
and lying still, (as <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> had kept her bed, being very<lb/>
weak, since April 6.) with a low voice, as speaking<lb/>
to her <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> said: How sweet is it to my<lb/>

place, from all <normalised orig="stormes" auto="true">storms</normalised> and tempests whatsoever.<lb/>
When the man was wounded by <normalised orig="theeves" auto="true">thieves</normalised>, and lay by<lb/>
the way; the Priest and the <notvariant>Levite</notvariant> passed by: they passed<lb/>
by and helped not: The creature comfort <normalised orig="failes" auto="true">fails</normalised>: and<lb/>
then the good Samaritan helps. Christ saves, when<lb/>
none <normalised orig="els" auto="true">else</normalised> will or can: and when there's nothing in the<lb/>

                  <lb/>
desire the Samaritans help. The deeper the wound is,<lb/>
the more honour to him that cures him. He set him on<lb/>
his own Beast, leaves him not to <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>, to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> where<lb/>
he will: but brought him in, and gave two pence for<lb/>
him. I <normalised orig="beleeve" auto="true">believe</normalised> that holds out Faith and Love. None<lb/>
cared for him, refuge <normalised orig="fail'd" auto="true">failed</normalised>, then Christ helps, and takes<lb/>
care for him.<lb/>
One speaking to her of her former condition,<lb/>
how far <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> was then from hope ever to <normalised orig="obtaine" auto="true">obtain</normalised><lb/>
mercy, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> said; If all the world should be saved, then<lb/>
it may be, I should be one; but <normalised orig="els" auto="true">else</normalised> no hopes for me. That<lb/>
