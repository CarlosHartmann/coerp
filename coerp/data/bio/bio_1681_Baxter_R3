                  <lb/>
§.1. THE soul while in the body, works much according<lb/>
to the bodies disposition. 1. She<lb/>
was of an extraordinary sharp and piercing Wit.<lb/>
2. She had a natural <notvariant>reservedness</notvariant>, and secrecy, increased<lb/>
by thinking it necessary prudence not to be<lb/>
open; by which means she was oft <normalised orig="mis-understood" auto="false">misunderstood</normalised><lb/>
by her nearest friends, and consequently often <normalised orig="crost" auto="true">crossed</normalised><lb/>
and disappointed by those that would have pleased<lb/>
her. And as she could understand men much by<lb/>
their looks and hints, so she expected all should<lb/>
know her mind without her expressing it, which<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="44">G2</fw>
                  <pb n="1"/>
                  <lb/>
bred her frustrations and discontents. 3. And she<lb/>
had a natural tenderness, and <notvariant>troubledness</notvariant> of mind,<lb/>
upon the crossing of her just desires: too quick, and<lb/>
ungovernable a sense of displeasing words or deeds.<lb/>
4. She had a diseased <normalised orig="unresistible" auto="false">irresistible</normalised> fearfulness; her<lb/>
quick, and too sensible nature was <normalised orig="over-timerous" auto="false">over-timorous</normalised>:<lb/>
and to increase it, she said she was four times, before<lb/>
I knew her, in danger of death (of which,<lb/>
one was by the Small-Pox): And more to increase<lb/>
it, her Mothers house (Apply-Castle, near Wellington),<lb/>
being a <normalised orig="Garison" auto="true">Garrison</normalised>, it was stormed while she was<lb/>
in it, and part of the housing about it burnt, and<lb/>
men lay killed before her face, and all of them<lb/>
threatened, and <normalised orig="stript" auto="true">stripped</normalised> of their <normalised orig="cloathing" auto="true">clothing</normalised>, so that<lb/>
they were fain to borrow <normalised orig="cloaths" auto="true">clothes</normalised>. 5. And the great<lb/>
work upon her soul, in her <normalised orig="coversion" auto="false">conversion</normalised>, moved all her<lb/>
passions. 6. And then her dangerous sickness, and<lb/>
the sentence of death to so young a Convert, must<lb/>
needs be a very awaking thing; and coming on her<lb/>
before she had any assurance of her justification, did<lb/>
increase her fear. 7. And in this case she lived in<lb/>
the Church-Yard side, where she saw all the Burials<lb/>
of the dead, and kept a deaths head (a skull) in<lb/>
her Closet still before her. And other such mortifying<lb/>
spectacles increased her sad disposition.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.2. And the excessive love which she had to her<lb/>
Mother, did much increase her grief when she expected<lb/>
death.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.3. Though she called it <normalised orig="melancholly" auto="true">melancholy</normalised>, that by<lb/>
all this she was cast into, yet it rather seemed a partly<lb/>
natural, and partly an adventitious diseased fearfulness<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="45">44</fw>
                  <pb n="2"/>
                  <lb/>
in a tender over-passionate nature, that had<lb/>
no power to quiet her own fears, without any other<lb/>
cloud on her understanding.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.4. And all was much <normalised orig="encreased" auto="true">increased</normalised> by her wisdom,<lb/>
so stifling all the appearances of it, that it all inwardly<lb/>
wrought, and had no ease by vent.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.5. And having keen spirits, and thin sharp<lb/>
blood, she had a strong <notvariant>Hemicrania</notvariant> or <normalised orig="Head-ake" auto="false">Headache</normalised> once<lb/>
a month, and oft once a fortnight, or more, from the<lb/>
age of fifteen or sixteen years. All these together<lb/>
much tended to hinder her from a quiet and comfortable<lb/>
temper.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.6. And in a word, all the operations of her<lb/>
soul were very intense and strong; strong wit, and<lb/>
strong love, and strong displeasure. And when God<lb/>
<normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> her what Holiness was, she thought she must<lb/>
presently have it in so great a degree as the ripest<lb/>
Saints do here attain; and that because she had not<lb/>
as much heavenly life, and sense, and delight in God<lb/>
as she knew she should have and desired, she concluded<lb/>
of it that she had none that was sincere.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.7. One of the first things by which her change<lb/>
was discovered to her Mother and Friends, was her<lb/>
fervent secret prayers: for living in a great house, of<lb/>
which the middle part was ruined in the Wars, she<lb/>
chose a Closet in the further end, where she thought<lb/>
none heard her: But some that over-heard her, said,<lb/>
they never heard so fervent prayers from any person.<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="46">45</fw>
                  <pb n="3"/>
                  <lb/>
§.8. Yet she desired me to draw up a form suited<lb/>
to her own condition; which I did, and find it now<lb/>
reserved among her Papers; but I cannot tell whether<lb/>
she ever used it, having affections and freedom<lb/>
of expression without it. I had thought to have annexed<lb/>
it for the use of afflicted Penitents: But it<lb/>
will be but a digression in this Narrative.<lb/>

                  <lb/>
§.1. THE <notvariant>unsuitableness</notvariant> of our age, and my<lb/>
former known purposes against Marriage,<lb/>
and against the <normalised orig="conveniency" auto="true">convenience</normalised> of Ministers Marriage,<lb/>
who have no sort of necessity, made our marriage<lb/>
the matter of much <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> talk and wonder:<lb/>
And the true opening of her case and mine, and the<lb/>
many strange occurrences which brought it to pass,<lb/>
would take away the wonder of her friends and<lb/>
mine that knew us; and the notice of it would<lb/>
much conduce to the understanding of some other<lb/>
passages of our lives: Yet wise Friends, by whom<lb/>
I am advised, think it better to omit such personal<lb/>
particularities, at least at this time. Both<lb/>
in her case and mine, there was much extraordinary,<lb/>
which it <normalised orig="doth" auto="false">does</normalised> not much concern the world to<lb/>
be acquainted with. From the first thoughts of it,<lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>*any</sic>
                     <corr>many</corr>
                  </choice> changes and stoppages intervened, and long delays,<lb/>
till I was silenced and ejected with many hundreds<lb/>
                  <pb n="4"/>
                  <lb/>
more; and so being separated from my old<lb/>
Pastoral Charge, which was enough to take up all<lb/>
my time and labour, some of my <normalised orig="disswading" auto="true">dissuading</normalised> Reasons<lb/>
were then over. And at last, on <normalised orig="Septemb" auto="false">September</normalised>. 10.<lb/>
1662. we were married in <notvariant>Bennet-Fink</notvariant> Church by<lb/>
Mr. Samuel Clerk (yet living), having been before<lb/>
Contracted by Mr. <notvariant>Simeon</notvariant> Ash, both in the presence<lb/>
of Mr. Henry <notvariant>Ashurst</notvariant> and Mrs. Ash.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.2. She consented to these Conditions of our<lb/>
Marriage: 1. That I would have nothing that before<lb/>
our Marriage was hers; that I (who wanted no<lb/>
outward supplies) might not seem to marry her for<lb/>
covetousness. 2. That she would so alter her affairs,<lb/>
that I might be <normalised orig="intangled" auto="true">entangled</normalised> in no Law-suits.<lb/>
3. That she would expect none of my time which<lb/>
my Ministerial work should require.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.3. When we were married, her sadness and melancholy<lb/>
vanished; counsel did something to it, and<lb/>
contentment something; and being taken up with<lb/>
our <normalised orig="houshold" auto="true">household</normalised> affairs, did somewhat. And we lived<lb/>
in <notvariant>inviolated</notvariant> love, and mutual complacency, sensible<lb/>
of the benefit of mutual help. These near nineteen<lb/>
years I know not that ever we had any breach<lb/>
in point of love, or point of interest, save only<lb/>
that she somewhat grudged that I had persuaded<lb/>
her for my quietness to surrender so much of her Estate,<lb/>
to a disabling her from helping others so much<lb/>
as she earnestly desired.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.4. But that even this was not from a covetous<lb/>
mind, is evident by these instances. 1. Though her<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="48">47</fw>
                  <pb n="5"/>
                  <lb/>
Portion (which was 2000 l. besides that given up<lb/>
aforesaid) was (by ill debtors) 200 l. lost in her<lb/>
Mothers time, and 200 l. after, before her Marriage;<lb/>
and all she had reduced to almost 1650 l. yet<lb/>
she never grudged at any thing that the poverty of<lb/>
Debtors deprived her of.<lb/>
2. She had before been acquainted with the Lord<lb/>
Chancellor's offering me a <normalised orig="Bishoprick" auto="true">Bishopric</normalised>; and though<lb/>
it might have taken off the censure of those Relations<lb/>
that thought she debased her self in marrying<lb/>
me, and also might have seemed desirable to her for<lb/>
the Wealth as well as the Honour; she was so far<lb/>
from desiring my accepting it, that I am persuaded<lb/>
had I done it, it would have alienated her much<lb/>
from me in point of esteem and love. Not that she<lb/>
had any opinion against Episcopacy then (that ever<lb/>
I could perceive) but that she abhorred a worldly<lb/>
mercenary mind in a Minister of Christ, and was a<lb/>
sharp <notvariant>Censurer</notvariant> of all that for gain, or honour, or<lb/>
worldly ends, would stretch their consciences to any<lb/>
thing that they thought God <normalised orig="forbad" auto="false">forbade</normalised>. And I am assured<lb/>
(though towards her end she <normalised orig="wisht" auto="true">wished</normalised> she had<lb/>
been abler to relieve the needy, and do more good;<lb/>
yet) she lived a far more contented life in our mean<lb/>
condition, even when she <normalised orig="stoopt" auto="true">stooped</normalised> to receive from <choice ana="print">
                     <sic><notvariant>oothers</notvariant></sic>
                     <corr>others</corr>
                  </choice>
                  <lb/>
that had been strangers to her, than she would<lb/>
have done had I been a Bishop, and she had had many<lb/>
thousand pounds more at her dispose; yea I am persuaded<lb/>
she would not easily have endured it.<lb/>
3. Another <normalised orig="tryal" auto="true">trial</normalised> of her <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>a*</sic>
                     <corr>as</corr>
                  </choice> to Wealth and Honour,<lb/>
was when I, and all such others, were cast out<lb/>
of all possession, and hope of all Ecclesiastical maintenance;<lb/>
she was not ignorant of the scorn and the<lb/>
                  <pb n="6"/>
                  <lb/>
jealousies, and wrath and prosecutions that I was<lb/>
like to be exposed to; yea, she had heard and seen it<lb/>
already begun by Bishop <notvariant>Morley's</notvariant> forbidding me to<lb/>
preach before, and preaching himself, and his Dean,<lb/>
and many others, fiercely against me in <notvariant>Kederminster</notvariant><lb/>
Pulpit; she had quickly heard them that were cast<lb/>
out and silenced, deeply accused as if they had deserved<lb/>
it. To <normalised orig="chuse" auto="true">choose</normalised> a participation of such a life<lb/>
that had no encouragement from any worldly<lb/>
Wealth or Honour, yea, that was exposed to such<lb/>
certain suffering which had no end in prospect on<lb/>
this side death, did <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> that she was far from covetousness.<lb/>
Much more evidence of this I shall <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> you<lb/>
as it falls in its place.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.5. Among other troubles that her Marriage exposed<lb/>
her to, one was our oft necessitated removals;<lb/>
which to those that must take Houses, and bind themselves<lb/>
to Landlords, and fit and furnish them, is more<lb/>
than for single persons that have no such clogs or<lb/>
cares. First, We took a House in <notvariant>Moorefields</notvariant>, after<lb/>
at Acton; next that, another at Acton; and after<lb/>
that, another there; and after that, we were put to<lb/>
remove to one of the former again; and after that,<lb/>
to divers others in another place and County, as <normalised orig="followeth" auto="true">follows</normalised>;<lb/>
and the women have most of that sort of<lb/>
trouble. But she easily bare it all.<lb/>
And I know not that ever she came to any place<lb/>
where she did not extraordinarily win the love of<lb/>
the inhabitants (unless in any street where she staid<lb/>
so short a time, as not to be known to them): Had<lb/>
she had but the riches of the world to have done<lb/>
the good that she had a heart to do, how much<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="50">H</fw>
                  <pb n="7"/>
                  <lb/>
would she have been loved, who in her mean and<lb/>
low condition won so much?<lb/>
And her carriage won more love than her liberality;<lb/>
she could not endure to hear one give another<lb/>
any <normalised orig="sowr" auto="true">sour</normalised>, rough, or hasty word; her speech<lb/>
and countenance was always kind and civil, whether<lb/>
she had any thing to give or not.<lb/>
And all her kindness tended to some better end,<lb/>
than barely to relieve peoples bodily wants; even<lb/>
to oblige them to some duty that tended to the good<lb/>
of their souls, or to deliver them from some straits<lb/>
which <normalised orig="fill'd" auto="true">filled</normalised> them with hurtful care, and became a<lb/>
matter of great temptation to them. If she could<lb/>
hire the poor to hear Gods word, from Conformist<lb/>
or Nonconformist, or to read good serious practical<lb/>
Books, whether written by Conformists or Nonconformists,<lb/>
it answered her end and desire: and many<lb/>
an hundred books <normalised orig="hath" auto="false">has</normalised> she given to those ends. But<lb/>
of these things more hereafter. This is here but to<lb/>
answer to <normalised orig="foresaid" auto="false">aforesaid</normalised> objection, and to lead on to the<lb/>
following particular passages of her life.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.6. While I was at Acton, her carriage and charity<lb/>
so won the people there, that all that I ever<lb/>
heard of, greatly esteemed and loved her. And she<lb/>
being earnestly desirous of doing good, prepared<lb/>
her house for the reception of those that would<lb/>
come in, to be instructed by me, between the morning<lb/>
and evening <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> Assemblies, and after: And<lb/>
the people that had never been used to such things,<lb/>
accounted worldly ignorant persons, gave us great<lb/>
hopes of their edification, and reformation, and filled<lb/>
the Room, and went with me also into the<lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="51">50</fw>
                  <pb n="8"/>
                  <lb/>
Church (which was at my door): And when I was<lb/>
after removed, the people hearing that I again<lb/>
wanted a house (being ten miles off), they unanimously<lb/>
subscribed a request to me, to return to my<lb/>
old house with them, and offered to pay my house-rent;<lb/>
which I took kindly: and it was much her<lb/>
winning conversation which thus won their love.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.7. When I was carried thence to the common<lb/>
Goal, for teaching them, as aforesaid, I never perceived<lb/>
her troubled at it: she cheerfully went<lb/>
with me into Prison; she brought her best bed thither,<lb/>
and did much to remove the removable <normalised orig="inconveniencies" auto="true">inconveniences</normalised><lb/>
of the Prison. I think she had scarce ever a<lb/>
pleasanter time in her life than while she was with<lb/>
me there. And whereas people upon such occasions<lb/>
were not <normalised orig="unapt" auto="false">inapt</normalised> to be liberal, it was against her mind<lb/>
to receive more than necessity required. Only three<lb/>
persons gave me just as much as paid Lawyers and<lb/>
prison-charges, and when one offered me more, she<lb/>
would not receive it: But all was far short of the<lb/>
great charges of our removal to another habitation .<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.8. The Parliament making a new sharper Law<lb/>
against us, I was forced to remove into another<lb/>
Country; thither she went with me, and removed<lb/>
her Goods that were movable, from Acton to <notvariant>Totteridge</notvariant>,<lb/>
being engaged for the Rent of the house we<lb/>
left: At <notvariant>Totteridge</notvariant>, the first year, few poor people<lb/>
are put to the hardness that she was put to; we<lb/>
could have no house but part of a poor Farmers,<lb/>
where the Chimneys so <normalised orig="extreamly" auto="true">extremely</normalised> <normalised orig="smoak't" auto="false">smoked</normalised>, as greatly<lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" n="52">H2</fw>
                  <pb n="9"/>
                  <lb/>
annoyed her health; for it was a very hard Winter,<lb/>
and the <normalised orig="Coal-smoak" auto="false">coal-smoke</normalised> so filled the Room that we<lb/>
all day sate in, that it was as a cloud, and we were<lb/>
even suffocated with the stink. And she had ever a<lb/>
great <normalised orig="straitness" auto="false">straightness</normalised> of the Lungs, and could not bear<lb/>
<normalised orig="smoak" auto="true">smoke</normalised> or closeness. This was the greatest bodily<lb/>
suffering that her outward condition put her to;<lb/>
which was increased by my continual pain there. But<lb/>
her charity to her poor Landlady, set her Son Apprentice,<lb/>
who now <normalised orig="liveth" auto="true">lives</normalised> well.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.9. Thence we removed to a house; which we<lb/>
took to our selves, which required so great alterations<lb/>
and amendment, as took her up much time and<lb/>
labour: and, to her great comfort, she got Mr. <notvariant>Corbet</notvariant><lb/>
and his Wife to dwell with us. And in all these<lb/>
changes and troubles she lived in great peace.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.10. When the Kings Declarations and Licenses<lb/>
gave Nonconformists leave to build Meeting-places,<lb/>
and Preach, she was against going to London, till<lb/>
                  <choice ana="illegible">
                     <sic>o*hers</sic>
                     <corr>others</corr>
                  </choice> were there <normalised orig="setled" auto="true">settled</normalised>, lest I should anticipate<lb/>
them, and gather any Auditors, who would else go<lb/>
to others, especially their old ejected Pastors; but<lb/>
when others were <normalised orig="setled" auto="true">settled</normalised>, she was earnest with me to<lb/>
go, for the exercise of my Ministry.<lb/>
                  <lb/>
§.11. Upon our remove to London, out of tender<lb/>
regard to my health, which she thought the situation<lb/>
might contribute much unto, she chose, and<lb/>
took for us the most pleasant and convenient house<lb/>
in Southampton-Square, where she died. These<lb/>
were our removes.<lb/>
