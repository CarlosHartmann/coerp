holiness, provide for them useful <normalised orig="imployments" auto="true">employments</normalised> <lb/>

leading them in the paths of religion and justice, <lb/>
by example and precepts of holiness; <lb/>
never provoking them to wrath, never indulging <lb/>
them in their follies, never conniving at <lb/>
an unworthy action: and that all my children <lb/>
may be thine, O preserve them in thy favour, <lb/>
or take them away from hence while <choice ana="print-error">

<normalised orig="Shew" auto="true">Show</normalised> me thy <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised> O Lord, teach me <lb/>

Remember O Lord thy tender mercies <lb/>

O <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> our cries from the bottom of our <lb/>
prisons, from the depths of our <normalised orig="sorrowes" auto="true">sorrows</normalised>; let <lb/>
this affliction be thy discipline to <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> contrition <lb/>
and repentance in our hearts. Thou <lb/>
art just O God in all that we suffer, and thou <lb/>
art to be glorified; and shame and confusion <lb/>
of face belongs unto us as it is this day: but <lb/>
never let us suffer the confusion of a sad eternity: <lb/>
Accept our sorrow and repentance, our <lb/>
suffering and our shame; that in the blood <lb/>
of the <normalised orig="Lambe" auto="true">Lamb</normalised> and in the <normalised orig="teares" auto="true">tears</normalised> of repentance <lb/>
our sins being washed, our <normalised orig="soules" auto="true">souls</normalised> may be presented <lb/>
pure and <normalised orig="spotlesse" auto="true">spotless</normalised> before the throne of <lb/>
grace, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<lb/>
