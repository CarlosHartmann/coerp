free us from the fear of <lb/>
ever coming into that <lb/>

That the third day thou <lb/>

First-fruits of them that <lb/>
are Asleep in their <lb/>

assured that they also <lb/>
shall not sleep there for <lb/>

by my Rising <lb/>
from Sin to Newness of <lb/>

the Infuser of all heavenly <lb/>

of thy Church in all <lb/>
the ways of Truth and <lb/>

I Have sinned against <lb/>

                  <lb/>
                  <lb/>

idle Thoughts, loose, <lb/>

in many kinds; I <lb/>

in chasing them <lb/>
from my mind; I have <lb/>
taken pleasure and content <lb/>
in them. I have been <lb/>
rash and offensive in my <lb/>
Words, wanton and corrupt <lb/>
in my Communications, <lb/>
and I have not <lb/>
kept my self from Vanity <lb/>
                  <pb n="76"/>

and Complacency in <lb/>

been injurious by them <lb/>

of Almighty <lb/>
God. <lb/>
I. Whom I have not <lb/>
<normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> set before mine <lb/>
eyes, nor studied to know <lb/>
and seek him (as I ought) <lb/>
above all things; and <lb/>

not acknowledged him, <lb/>
                  <pb n="77"/>

in reverencing his Power <lb/>

                     <corr>and</corr>
                  </choice> Majesty as I should. <lb/>
Yea I have sometimes <lb/>
Doubted of him, misbelieving <lb/>
his promises, <lb/>
and not trusting to <lb/>
his Help. I have made <lb/>
Flesh my arm, and put <lb/>
my confidence in the <lb/>
pleasing Vanities and uncertain <lb/>
<normalised orig="Prosperities" auto="true">Prosperity's</normalised> of <lb/>
the World. I have otherwhile <lb/>
been full of roving <lb/>
and <normalised orig="unlawfull" auto="true">unlawful</normalised> imaginations <lb/>
concerning God, <lb/>
and full of <normalised orig="wandring" auto="true">wandering</normalised> <lb/>
thoughts in his Service. <lb/>
II. I have often framed <lb/>
and set up to my <lb/>
                  <pb n="78"/>
                  <lb/>
self divers Imaginations <lb/>
and <normalised orig="Formes" auto="true">Forms</normalised> of God's <lb/>
Worship and Religion <lb/>
which he <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> not set <lb/>
and established in his <lb/>
Church. <lb/>
I have been negligent <lb/>
in giving him his External <lb/>
Worship and Honour, <lb/>
not falling down <lb/>
before him with that inward <lb/>
reverence of Spirit <lb/>
and Truth, nor with that <lb/>
outward Order and Humility <lb/>
of my Body which <lb/>
is requisite <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> to be <lb/>
<normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> forth and done <lb/>
before him. <lb/>
III. I have often drawn <lb/>
                  <pb n="79"/>
                  <lb/>
near unto him with my <lb/>
lips, when my heart <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
been far from him. I have <lb/>
too frequently vainly &amp; <lb/>
inconsiderably used his <lb/>
great and fearful Name, <lb/>
and in the eagerness of <lb/>
my spirit I have not abstained <lb/>
from abusing it <lb/>
with rash <normalised orig="Oathes" auto="true">Oaths</normalised> and Execrations. <lb/>
My vows and <lb/>
promises that I have <lb/>
made in his Name, I have <lb/>
not performed: Those <lb/>
Holy things whereon his <lb/>
sacred Name is set and imprinted, <lb/>
I have not duly <lb/>
regarded, and through <lb/>
my presumptuous vanities <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">E</fw>
                  <pb n="80"/>
                  <lb/>
I have been an occasion <lb/>
to make his Name be <lb/>
evil spoken of and <normalised orig="prophaned" auto="true">profaned</normalised> <lb/>
by others. <lb/>
IV. I have often absented <lb/>
my self from the <normalised orig="publick" auto="true">public</normalised> <lb/>
Worship and Service <lb/>
of his Holy Assemblies &amp; <lb/>
Sanctuary, vainly misspending <lb/>
the <normalised orig="daies" auto="true">days</normalised> that <lb/>
are hallowed to the Honour <lb/>
of his great Name. <lb/>
V. I have not carried <lb/>
that reverence and regard, <lb/>
nor given that due <lb/>
obedience which I ought <lb/>
to them whom God <normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> <lb/>
placed over me, seeking <lb/>
rather my own will and <lb/>
                  <pb n="81"/>
                  <lb/>
pleasure, then submitting <lb/>
my self to their lawful <lb/>
precepts, and advice. I <lb/>
have too much unregarded <lb/>
the persons of my <lb/>
betters, &amp; been unthankful <lb/>
to them that have deserved <lb/>
well of me. <lb/>
VI. I have not done to <lb/>
all others as I would <lb/>
that they should do to <lb/>
me; I have envied their <lb/>
welfare, the better and <lb/>
more prosperous life of <lb/>
others above my own. I <lb/>
have often let the reins <lb/>
of my passion loose to <lb/>
anger, malice and revenge, <lb/>
uncharitably delighting <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">E 2</fw>
                  <pb n="82"/>
                  <lb/>
in the mischief <lb/>
and destruction of my <lb/>
own private or peculiar <lb/>
Enemies. When out of <lb/>
my Abundance I might <lb/>
have relieved others that <lb/>
were in Want, I have <lb/>
many times neglected it. <lb/>
VII. I have often suffered <lb/>
my fancy and affections <lb/>
to wander licentiously: <lb/>
I have not held <lb/>
mine Eyes, nor mine Ears <lb/>
nor my Tongue from vanity: <lb/>
I have not carefully <lb/>
eschewed the occasions <lb/>
and enticements to <lb/>
corrupt and vain affections. <lb/>
I have not preserved <lb/>
                  <pb n="83"/>
                  <lb/>
my Body in that Holiness, <lb/>
Honour and purity, <lb/>
which <normalised orig="becometh" auto="true">becomes</normalised> the <lb/>
Temple of God. <lb/>
VIII. I have not reckoned <lb/>
Godliness to be my <lb/>
Greatest Gain, nor been <lb/>
content with that which <lb/>
I have. <lb/>
IX. I have listened to <lb/>
Flattery, and used it towards <lb/>
others: Of many <lb/>
I have had evil suspicions, <lb/>
and given rash judgment <lb/>
upon them. Upon <lb/>
my self I have set a greater <lb/>
value than I deserved, <lb/>
and seemed better than I <lb/>
was, that I might gain a <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">E 3</fw>
                  <pb n="84"/>
                  <lb/>
false reputation from others. <lb/>
And I have often <lb/>
suffered Truth to be <lb/>
gainsaid. <lb/>
X. I am guilty of many <lb/>
inordinate desires and irregulate <lb/>
affections. <lb/>
And <normalised orig="wo" auto="true">woe</normalised> is me that in <lb/>
all these things I have <lb/>
offended: For if in all <lb/>
these things my Heart <lb/>
should not condemn me, <lb/>
God is greater than my <lb/>
Heart, and <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> all <lb/>
things. But I confess <lb/>
them, and confessing <lb/>
am sorry for them, and <lb/>
being sorry for them am <lb/>
ready to leave them, his <lb/>
                  <pb n="85"/>
                  <lb/>
Grace thereunto assisting <lb/>
me: and not only to leave <lb/>
them, but to judge my <lb/>
self for them: with all <lb/>
religious lowliness and <lb/>
alacrity submitting my <lb/>
self freely to the pious directions <lb/>
and advice that <lb/>
shall be given me by my <lb/>
Spiritual <normalised orig="Governours" auto="true">Governors</normalised> &amp; <lb/>
Ministers of God, for <lb/>
<normalised orig="shewing" auto="true">showing</normalised> forth the fruits <lb/>
of my sorrow and repentance, <lb/>
meet for amendment <lb/>
of life. And though <lb/>
I be altogether unworthy, <lb/>
yet for the Worth <lb/>
and Merits of my Saviour, <lb/>
in whose Merits and <lb/>
                  <lb/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">E 4</fw>
                  <pb n="86"/>
                  <lb/>
Mercy I put my whole <lb/>
Trust and confidence, being <lb/>
(as he is) the Propitiation <lb/>
not only for my <lb/>
sins, but for all the sins of <lb/>
the World, I most humbly <lb/>
crave Pardon and <lb/>
Absolution from them, <lb/>
and from all my other <lb/>
sins which I may have <lb/>
now forgotten, and <lb/>
whereof my Conscience <lb/>
may be afraid. <lb/>

O Lord, thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> dealt <lb/>
graciously with thy <lb/>
servant, according to thy <lb/>
great Goodness and Mercy. <lb/>
Before I was troubled I went <lb/>
astray; but now I will take <lb/>
heed to my <normalised orig="waies" auto="true">ways</normalised>, that I <lb/>
swerve not from thy precepts. <lb/>
It is good for me that <lb/>
I have been in trouble, that <lb/>
I may learn to obey thy <lb/>
Commandments. <lb/>

RIghteous art thou, O <lb/>

Judgments. Trouble and <lb/>
heaviness have taken hold <lb/>
upon me, but my sure Trust <lb/>
<normalised orig="hath" auto="true">has</normalised> been in thy Mercy. O <lb/>

let my Soul live, and it shall <lb/>

I Will <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> give thanks <lb/>

O Lord my God, I cried unto <lb/>
Thee, and thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> healed <lb/>
me: Thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">have</normalised> turned my <lb/>
heaviness into joy, and girded <lb/>

I Sought the Lord, and he <lb/>
